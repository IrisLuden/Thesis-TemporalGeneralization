back on dec 9 as a noob i sent btc from coinbase to binance usdt .
binance support says they can not receive these coins at all '' and for me to contact the target address .
i thought the target address is binance 's usdt address .
i started keto about two weeks ago and incorporated if about three days ago .
question is what 's the best time to do resistance training ?
i workout 60 mins of resistance training with another 30 mins of cardio in the end for at least five times a week .
i prefer to work out in the morning but worried that doing resistance training on an empty stomach may be bad and result in muscle loss .
moving the workout to the middle of the eating hours between 12pm and 8pm is really not a preferred choice due to work .
give each map a 1/13 chance to be played .
once the map is played remove it from the rotation until all maps have been played .
this will remove the issue where people constantly play the same maps when they log on .
as soon as i heard dum da da dadadadadadadadadada i knew what the fuck it was .
i stopped everything i was doing got the fuck off from the computer and ran to the tv and started to sing along for the next 20 seconds or so .
listening to knock knock as i 'm typing this as well .
for anyone curious for what commercial it was i was watching a football game on fox but the commercial was sponsored from nfl network .
i do n't know if i 'll hear another a song by him on tv again but damn that was a good moment .
i want to make a decent squad and need help deciding on value for money players i need to know whether i should get if gnabry or aubameyang .
i also need to know the best bundesliga german cb in value for coins .
i 've been in many toxic community lol hello and this game has the friendliest i 've seen so far !
i was going to buy a mod from this guy but he was in the shower .
he messaged me and i thought i 'd buy something from him anyway .
i was going to buy another mod from him but instead of plat he gave it to me for free for inconvenience according to him .
i saw another mod 2 in fact from the same person .
one was for 26 plat and the other for 29 plat .
i messaged him for the 26 and his first response was nice try troll .
i told him about the 2 listing and he apologized immediately and sold it to me for 26'even though i was willing to pay for 29 .
i 'm glad this community is like this and i hope ya 'll never change .
i 've been on hrt via my insurance for over a year now .
that insurance is expiring and it looks like i probably wo n't be able to get new insurance .
i 'm trying to look on the positive side of this .
namely that maybe i can finally lower my testosterone .
no amount of spironolactone was getting my testosterone to drop more than a tiny bit from its starting levels .
it seems like it 's been seriously inhibiting my transition a lot less has happened than anyone would suggest should happen in the amount of time i 've been on them but my doctor 's refused to do anything about it .
i 'd seen it suggested that mpa could help in cases like mine to reduce the production of testosterone rather than merely trying to block it .
i 'd requested it from my doctor but she repeatedly refused to even acknowledge my request with a response .
so if i 'm really being forced onto diy i guess i can finally try this ?
the problem is i have no idea what the typical dosages are for trans women using it or what the absolute most i should ever take per day is .
i 've been on 6mg estradiol 200mg spiro and 5mg finasteride .
i do n't know how much mpa i 'd want to be taking and how often per day nor do i know if i 'd want to cut anything else i 'm taking in addition to that .
so i was hoping someone here could help me with numbers ?
i have an old ipod laying around and i was wondering if i could set it up so i can authenticate with my phone and the ipod in case anything happens to my phone and i lose access .
since they made zardes tradeable will toty players also be tradeable ?
its so tempting to raise my ovr to 100 plus with the cash ... if only they would confirm a release date for toty and whether the players will be tradeable
and while i lack the genie that can fulfill 3 of your wishes .
i do however have the ability to potentially whisk you away for an adventure on a magical carpet if you meet my fancy .
i prefer my ovens to come with a bun already in them .
you 're thick/a bbw do n't worry my magical carpet is made of carbon fiber
you 're at least 21 and do n't drink/smoke/do pot cause you 're pregnant .
you and your male partner if there is one involved are clean .
not because i wan na have a 2 dude threesome but for my peace of mind .
if you 're on some popular dating app lem me know and i can just message you there and we can see whether we like each other 's looks .
me i 'm a 5'9 '' tall indian dude with a killer beard and badass hair .
and i only have an accent when i say thank you come again '' lol
i realize that this is a bit weird request .
but i promise i 'm not a creep perv .
just a genuine guy who 's not afraid to go for what he likes .
you will be treated with respect and not judged .
the team went to the super bowl the following year .
we are also mathematically better than a jim tomsula or chip kelly coached team .
i think it might be interesting if we all shared our schedules for different age groups .
in the early months i struggled to get my twins synced on the same schedule and i really did n't know where to start .
mine are 11 months old and this is the schedule we 've been using since 7 months .
they 're sleeping right around 11 or 12 hours at night .
things i 'll note we do n't do as many solids as other people i know .
we have super chronic constipation issues with my daughter so we keep things simple .
sometimes they cry 5 min but they 're good about putting themselves to sleep .
they stopped taking their 3rd nap around 4 months bummer right ?
i feel like my daughter might be ready to drop to one nap soon .
i 'd love to know what others are doing especially those that are around 12-18 months .
and if you 're like i was and you 're in the 0-6 month range and without a schedule i too struggled with that !
not sure why maybe because my b/g twins had such drastically different eating and sleeping needs for a long time .
logan lucky has so many accolades that have been lauded by reviewers and moviegoers alike my friends have said the same thing .
but i was also glad to see that the song country roads '' brought them and me together a little bit more .
it was n't cool at all to say you liked john denver in the '80s my older brothers hated his wimpy '' records .
if you were a rocker you could n't admit to liking that song that made you seem like you liked the things your babyboomer or '60s parents liked which was uncool .
but that song is bigger than john denver it was written by another better songwriter and the harmonies are so incredibly sentimental and happy .
and i grew up to love blues jazz and bluegrass on top of rock .
the little song number by the daughter really tied the movie together as a love letter to west virginia .
and i thought it painted the funny quaint cultural things they joke about in the movie in a loving light and leaves the moviegoer off with the knowledge that they only added all those weird shots about nascars balloon animals and fried food to tease the inhabitants like a cheeky sibling would .
the writers showed they really loved the underlying culture the heart of it .
just to tie it off with a bow and to show what the movie made me feel partly i end with a link to my favorite rendition of the song from wonderful georgia .
the love of play in that video that happiness in the bandmembers all the smiles between them .
the deepest form of sibling love between a man and his struggling one-armed brother gets me deep because i have one brother and i love him would take a bullet for him .
that is what logan lucky '' made me feel .
i am super easily distracted and have thought about going on a retreat or staying somewhere else even renting a hotel to get some writing done .
i live in alaska where i have a number of cabins and literal off-the-grid places to go but they 're generally cold and lacking in power so little good for charging my laptop .
i do have my friend 's cabin i could go to but it 's inaccessible this time of year and i 'm just itching to gtfo of town for a few days and hunker down with my notes and some pb js .

free all day tomorrow and since its a new year i have more time off since the holiday rush is over .
went into a ranked game with where my teammates softlocked reim and wp ringo and i softlock lance .
then with 15 seconds left on the clock ringo locks in and so do i .
as soon as that happens the reim switches to lyra out of the blue does even signal to be jungle so i swap to be jungler instead .
then the game starts the lyra starts to bulid toward a fountain then does a complete 180 and goes for cp build .
seeing as the enemy is kicking the shit out of us i decide to sell my all my stuff for a fountain and crucible and start building as a captain that however did n't work .
maybe the most furious ive ever been at another player .
so eczema has slowly been scaling up my arms so slowly i actually thought it might have been something else at first .
it 's taken over 3 weeks to start look like eczema meanwhile overnight my neck has started to get it so quickly .
i hardly get any water on my neck except for in my shower so what is happening ?
my hands have been getting better only bleeding once a day now usually at night before i go to bed .
i know i should n't complain but i 'm at my wits end .
i 'm a shm whose husband works shift work .
i parent alone 2/3rds of the year but it seems like even when my so is home he does nothing to help unless i bring it to his attention .
his favorite reaction to lo crying is to ask whaaat ? in a sing song voice .
it 's become nails on a bloody chalkboard to me .
get off your damn games and cell phone and pick the child up .
he 's 4 months old and thinks he can walk so all he wants to do is stand all the time !
heading to church i take the dog out this morning and get back in to find lo still without a hat or blanket and no bag to be seen so hands him back to me so he could put on his shoes .
it just annoys me because i got dressed got lo dressed and did my hair and makeup one handed while holding lo and entertaining him all while so took a shower .
he 's great at doing things when i tell him but it comes down to i feel like i 'm parenting my child and my husband .
right now i 'm cuddled in our guest bed under lo because he is having trouble adjusting to sleeping unswaddled .
so fell asleep with the tv blaring after he told me he had set the timer and i can hear it from the next room which means i 'm not going to be able to sleep .
oh and our house is a mess because the only time i can clean is during the night because lo does n't believe in naps .
i 'm in the process of starting a house-wide clean out so things are everywhere and my so decides tomorrow is the perfect time to have company over .
i 'd love to have people over when we do n't have any place to sit and our house looks like it exploded .
i definitely do n't need you to help by watching lo these few days you 're actually home .
and tomorrow i 'll get questioned about why i was n't in bed when he woke up ... .
i do want to make it clear that i feel very blessed to be able to stay home with my son .
i know my husband works long hours to support us and i appreciate it .
i just feel like the effort it takes to raise a child is lost to him and he just assumes i 'll do/can do everything when i ca n't .
question ... so today i was at my cousins house and she is one of my bridesmaids .
her dress had come in the mail so she tried it on ... it looks great .
small possible problem ... it 's a mesh material .
all the bridesmaid dresses were supposed to be chiffon .
my fiancé and i originally went to david 's bridal just the two of us to pick out dresses .
we decided that the people wearing dresses could get any style they wanted as long as it was the color either malibu or regency depending on which side of the bridal party they were on and chiffon material .
the day my cousin came to try on the bridesmaid dresses i decided to try on wedding dresses also since i was already going to be there and ended up falling in love with one of the dresses .
so i guess i got a bit distracted and did n't notice that the dress she had selected was n't chiffon .
so i guess my actual question is ... is it going to look bad if she has a mesh dress and everyone else has chiffon ?
on my side there will be 3 people in dresses and 2 in suits .
and on my fiancé 's will be 4 in dresses 1 in a suit .
i 'm not going to have my cousin get another dress bc it 's not her fault .
it 's going to be okay right ? ? ! ? ? ? ! ? !
here let me help you i offered since it was obvious they were covered in blood you do n't want to smear your dress.
so i 'm rereading the series and rand is meeting ba'alzamon fro the first time in tel'aran'rhiod and he said this line
i whispered again and the high king sent his armies across the aryth ocean across the world sea and sealed two dooms .
the doom of his dream of one land and one people and a doom yet to come .
also i 've always been confused about the point of having the towers of midnight in the story .
i think it 's said the empress will return there to do something but it does n't have any impact on tar'mon gaidon that i remember .
why was this included and so important that a book was named after it .
currently i have g303 but it is heavy for me .

in the scenario where investment returns are greater than mortgage interest it 's not optimal to pay cash for a home .
instead it makes sense to invest the cash withdrawing only what 's needed monthly .
given that loans typically have a debt-to-income ratio requirement i 'm wondering how lenders would look at the situation .
if someone has 2m in cash and wants to buy a 500k home can they get a loan for 80 400k of it if they 're not presently employed ?
for me the first half of the year sucked ass and i 'm glad that 's over !
i was extremely emotionally abused by my ex for so long until i decided enough was enough he was selfish and only cared about himself .
after i ended it i was going to swear off of guys and i was never going get into a relationship again ! ! !
i had to move back in with my parents but that 's going fine for now .
even though my parents think i 'm a dirty heathen because i do n't go to church but i help pay the bills so they just have to deal .
around the same time we got a new coworker at work he 's nice but has a confidence about him that he 's not afraid to stand his ground .
we start going to get just a couple of drinks after work we invited others on shift but they never showed up so as ed sheeran wrote/sang we just talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour and it always feels like minutes .
we end up dating and i am now in the best relationship that i have ever been .
thank you 2017 for giving me the courage to walk away when i needed and to not give up on love !
here 's to leaving past relationships in the past and to new love !
i ca n't wait to see what 2018 has in store.😘
.. butjustin 's arrogance is fatal for the whole project .
maybe there are minor problems left to handle unforeseen .
still you do n't do crucial updates and mess with investors before release .
our brain are made by the same the that created the universe .
the same thing also created marijuana lsd and mushrooms .
do you think it 's on accident they were created for us to take them and experience what we experience ?
like the universe did n't know it would do that to us ?
i feel like the universe has a system more complex than that .
i get chat messages but when i open up the window i ca n't see anything more than the preview .
if the message is longer than about 3 words i have no idea what the rest of it says .
i can hover over and get the full text but that does n't help if someone has sent two or more messages in a row .
even opening in a dedicated window does n't help and there 's nothing in the documentation that says how to physically use chat .
he sounded like he had a long-lasting cold and that 's not a complaint i absolutely love it it just sounded very different when he was singing then it returned to normal for the most part during golden age
i i bought a turkey deep fryer the other day and on christmas i deep fried me a turkey .
after i was done deep frying it i drained the oil but i did not strain any particles out and i did not put it in the refrigerator i just put it back into its original container and set it on my shelf in the pantry .
when i look at the container that it 's in the oil is a little bit darker than it normally should be and it has a little bit of a scent as well but not the scent of rotten food or rancid at least i do n't think so plus i just got done deep frying a turkey in it 6 or 7 days ago .
my question is do you think the oil is still good for me to use today if i were to fry some chicken in there ?
i have about a half a gallon of brand new peanut oil and then i have a gallon of used peanut oil that i used to fry the turkey in .
when i look in the container there is no food particles that i can see with my naked eye but like i said it does have a little bit of a scent to it and it is a little off colored .
so i got to the part where indol becomes hostile and you ca n't visit them for salvaging purposes namely fast blade switch v aux core materials and could not find a single bit of loot i needed even when using premium cylinders .
i just thought i 'd make it known for anyone else that runs into this issue but you have to progress the story past the part where poppi jets rex and mythra up for an attack do n't wan na post too much spoilers .
after that i started finding indol salvage at the port in rigitte harbor .
just a post for those trying to find those green diodes !
my biological grandfather was stationed at mare island at the start of ww2 .
he was a sergeant in the usmc and was originally from new jersey .
the only other info on him was that his nickname was pat .
i found some military records about him while he was at mare island but that 's it .
i ca n't find anything about him for after the war .
if so did he start a family after his return ?
i do n't know where to look so anything is helpful .

considering the way this season started i ca n't help but feel like this is such a great turning point that we 've hit .
i really like what anthony lynn has brought to the team as well as his mentality and coaching style ... it just feels different almost refreshing .
i know it took a few games 4 to be exact but after that horrific start we finished 9-3 .
if i did the math right a full season of the kind of play we saw during the last 3/4 of this season puts us at 12-4 .

just recently got into fishing so to be honest i do n't know much of anything .
lately i have been reading about how to crappie fish and i have had two fishing trips with not a single bite .
i do not own a boat so i have been fishing off of long docks
been using 12 lb line a crappie jig and a lure that is similar to this https images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/511-fjf-vwl._sx355_.jpg
only fished in winter here i try to cast as far away from the dock as possible as i read they are in deeper water in winter .
i have tried jigging directly below the dock for hours .
my old man said i need to use thinner line why would this be ?
does anyone else have any general advice for me ?

this is the best tl dr i could make original https www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/opinion/sunday/when-forecasters-get-it-wrong-always.html reduced by 65 .
in early 2017 forecasters took rising poll numbers for nationalists extrapolated them into the future and imagined formerly fringe right-wingers gaining influence and setting off a eurozone crisis .
forecasters are prone to focus on a single story line particularly one as compelling as angry populism .
most forecasters share the establishment disdain for mr. trump yet few paused to consider whether a leader they see as inept and divisive could deliver all this as fast as he promised .
liberals who thought mr. trump would induce a global recession proved even farther off the mark .
if one were to avoid the straight-line projections political biases and single factors that so often distort forecasts what would a 2018 forecast look like ?
not like the consensus which is euphoric over the current combo of high growth and low inflation .
for better or worse mr. trump had less impact on the global economy than most experts expected in 2017 .

that is feeding off your partner and them feeding off of you as a source of self esteem utility and self verification having a partner symbolises you as worthy of love attractive etc .
as well in the case where love fades and you 're to be possessed by a concept that of a ‘boyfriend ' or girlfriend ' and have to do things socially expected of you .
it becomes love in the absence of any love .
and finally for those already in relationships you may hear the whole you 're a nihilist ?
does that mean you would leave me anytime you like ? what do you love more nihilism or me ? .
had to sell out of pac on yobit due to problems throughout the day and ended up getting blocked by the website in general .
any recommendations as to where i can buy back in ?
i 'm a woman who 's never had a healthy relationship .
there was one guy i was dating who was great ... except he just could n't let go of his ex so not so great .
i had 2 nights of good sex in the whole of 2017 with a guy i 'd a fling with .
then i met a guy who quickly told me he was in love with me ... except he barely ever touched me and he flirted with other women .
the worst part is that he was well endowed and an amazing kisser but check this the handful of times we had sex it was good in the beginning but then he stopped it .
he stopped in the middle of sex every single time .
so thanks mr. good sex of 2017 for the good times .
here 's to many many good nights of sex in 2018 !
i work american hours which means i need a room with good wifi capable of good skype video chat in koh lanta .
hello i am trying to grow my discord channel dabb1nation '' for gamers to come join and find people to group up with .
it really can be for any games you want !
i would like for everyone to be over 21 or just more mature individuals that wo n't rage quit and make huge commotions in the channel etc .
right now i have been playing a lot of playerunknown 's battleground .
it would be nice to squad up with some people as i am a new player .
i have only had pubg for about a week and escape is not even done downloading .
i have found a new love for realism in video games and apparently eft is where it 's at .
i like to do campaign races and marvel at my own replays while listening to eurobeat .
i prefer my cars to be completely stock with only a few modifications to the transmission depending on the track .
i just finished the sunday cup and the clubman cup .
initially i was going with either the gt86 or the r32 skyline to get through these races but the gt86 was simply too slow and i could n't figure out how to handle the r32 on a lot of corners .
the rx-7 was close enough in power to the r32 and i did n't know how it was going to handle so i gave it a try and damn it is smooth .
it does n't handle corners as well as the 86 or maybe it 's just me but the speed makes up for it in spades .
i still had to tweak the transmission but i found a sweet spot that gave me enough acceleration and speed to win these races just as long as i made practically no mistakes .
nice little speed boost coming out of turns similar to what the r32 offers but the rx-7 definitely handles better for me .
maybe i 'm just not driving the r32 correctly .
i hope they bring more of these older cars back .
i see coins listed the day of the listing and already very impactful trading has happened and obviously many people know about it so i 'd like to also trade the moment something hits the exchange .
where can i hear/read about when you accept a coin and when it hits the exchange ?
it reminds me of a youtube video i saw where someone was dressing their little poodle puppy or similar breed i 'm no expert in child clothing and shoes with a mini backpack on and a wig .
the puppy was trained to walk on its hind legs .
not just for 1 minute but talking an actual walk/jog until it reaches its destination .
it also showed the dog being beaten for wanting to sit on its hind legs .
comments left on the video had a variety of opinions ... flat out abuse and cruelty the person deserved to die and also that the video was only showing one side of the dog 's life saying it was biased the dog actually had a good life but that was part of training that it wants to please its owner and will do it anyway and other things .
i saw another dog on instagram that walks on its hind legs .
the video showed the dog walking for at least 30 seconds and it would look to the person holding the camera every 5 seconds and look back over its shoulder after that .
of course you ca n't tell how the dog rly feels about doing this .
the other instagram photos showed the dog posing at dusk with a silhouette of it standing on its hind legs curled up next to another dog in front of a fireplace .
what are your thoughts about getting a dog to do this ?
is it unhealthy for the dog to walk like that ?
do you think it 's cruel to train a dog to do this ?
obviously people want to be recognized and be famous for it .
honestly it got me so fired up seeing that instagram video brought back memories of the little dog on youtube that was being beaten .
plus the admin of the instagram page is japanese-speaking and i only know basic conversation japanese .
the fact the person is doing this to be recognized on social media is enough to make me sick .
i still think the google maps timeline thing is creepy but it was cool to go through everything and add all this up .
i feel very lucky to have gotten to try so many things and learn so much from so many different people .
it was a fun ride guys but not releasing wraith in time just does not give me the right feelings .
do we already have a mechanism/website where you can track or view any bulk orders placed for a certain crypto ?
if we get this resource it 'd be very helpful to understand the tone of the markets and what crypto is gon na moon !
i 've been asking around the last few days and it seems as if no one actually truly understands how handling impacts your weapons .
i 've also watched videos and content creators have n't really explained it properly
what is the better method in terms of accuracy and speed when solving a 2nd degree polynomial equation using an arduino ?
i 'm still pretty new so please tell me if i 've messed up any sort of formatting or have violated any rules .
years ago i read a book and sadly i can not recall the title or the author .
i remember that it was revealed that modi was the daughter of thor .
there was a bit where she met freya stole her falcon cloak and was transformed into a falcon so she could travel somewhere quickly .
the book ended with her partnering with someone so that she could go and wake thor up from some sort of spell .
i 'm not entirely sure why but i remember that the phrase thunder tree '' was used when referring to modi .
it was a longer book paper back and it has been at least 6 years since i read it .
it was certainly geared toward a more young adult audience .
in addition based on my own efforts in searching it was not a widely acclaimed or well known book .
i hope all of this can help and cheers to anyone who can offer help !
i see this https github.com/vergecurrency/verge/releases and it appears that wraith has actually been released .

he is technically owned by a service animal organization so we could contact them as well .
last but not least my mother believes there 's a possibility she 's attempting/committing fraud to get a relative out of jail .
i 'm directly related to why he 's in jail and am concerned she will do that and succeed .

you do have to roll the gatcha but there two types friend points fp which are easy to get but only get you servants and craft essences ce think of them as equipment up to 3 star rating .
the other is the saint quartz gatcha sq quarts etc which gives 3-5 star servants and ces .
it can be bought with real money but you will also slowly gather it from logging in daily completing story missions playing free mission available after finish a story mission and as giveaways from delightworks the makers of fgo .
there also summon tickets that let you roll on the quartz gatcha once per ticket .
you can buy '' 5 per month with a certain free in game currency .
there times when you can get them for free in other ways as well .
lastly when you start the game during the course of the tutorial level you get to roll for a guaranteed servant usually a 4 star and shortly after you 'll be given enough enough quarts to do a multi-roll 10 pulls .
check wikis and guides online info for more info .

one of the problems of this sub is the outright dismissal of the notion that mormons could legitimately be interested in your life feelings etc .
i 'm not trying to convert just trying to have a discussion .
for everyone saying that missionaries are instructed to only convert and to not make friends or be emotionally invested here is the reality
missionaries keep a strict schedule and their primary purpose is to invite as many people to learn as much as they can about god through something they believe is unique and encourages healthy living lots of people will argue with this but that is a sub for another day .
that being said missionaries want you to learn from them and others by keeping commitments and having a guided discussion which i can say can be difficult for many/most of the missionaries sitting in people 's living rooms right now .
they would basically ask you to read some stuff and pray for specific answers meet people in the church go to meetings etc etc .
if you do n't want to keep commitments the most likely result will be that the missionaries will prioritize their time somewhere else because they measure progress by a willingness to try it out .
if someone is unwilling to keep a commitment they have to try and talk with people who will .
some of my greatest friends were made on my mission and they do n't have a lick of interest in what i was trying to tell them .
we made ribs with a guy who told us that everything we were teaching was a joke .
did we spend a bunch of time with him ?
were we still his friend and did we answer questions for him ?
tell them that you are not interested and wo n't be investigating the church .
also tell them to remove you from their potential investigator list .
politely ask them to remove you from the group or leave i do n't mess with facebook as much as i used to and to not contact you again .
they will probably try and hold on to you by asking for one little tiny thing but be firm .
if they keep asking feel free to add me to the group and i will chew some manners into them while figuring out how to remove you from the chat .
they should lay off before you even consider doing this but you never know .
if they are halfway decent people they will act like it and appreciate your honesty .
if they are weird and pushy that 's not mormon it 's just weird and pushy .
plenty of non missionary folks are down to have a discussion about what they believe .
i would n't even mess with missionaries until you have had a regular conversation with a mormon .
how long will the 300 series chipsets last before they are obsolete ?

there have been some weird things since the latest patch my reticles have been really blurry .
the raddus was able to setup without taking any fire .
it 's not just the calculation that is difficult it 's being able to hit a target that ca n't neutralize or move out of the way first .

i think maybe it came from to plot a course '' and some sports writer trying to sound cool started using it and it caught on .
there 's a lot of that in sportswriting where one person abuses english to sound cool and then it catches on .

no you can not move a balance as there is no way to identify you as the owner .
best advice is mine til you reach .01 then switch to internal and when fees come down enough you will get paid on the external .
it should n't be much longer anyways the fees have already come down a lot
yo i study at uowd and it is certainly not bad pretty good actually .
my friends who are doing bba said that it 's pretty good .
socialization it 's alright like if you can talk well then you might as well be able to get friends .
even if a guy or girl flirts with you on a regular basis does n't automatically mean they want to fuck you or want you to flash tits/cock .
no harm in flirting but take it with a grain of salt .
god i hope then they do release it it 's lemonade-style .
just announce it and then make it available at the same time .

like the way ronda acted towards miesha on tuf was so much worse than the stuff between carla and randa .
plus carla was n't the only one who got rubbed the wrong way by her rose and felice both did too and it sounded like they left a lot of stuff out .
the only other beef she had that i can think of was with claudia who dropped out last minute from their title fight because she was cutting weight badly and it was a complete waste of carlas time .
and she 'd dropped out of another previous fight they were supposed to have .
philly lost their qb minnesota still has case keenum la has goff and none of these teams have much in the way of playoff experience .

it 's really eye opening how fake it is .

there is no crit cap for lancer only a drop off point where getting further crit does n't justify the investment shield counter is a guaranteed crit at a lowish cf and spring attack and wallop peter out at around 35 crit rate this is explained in one of the guides and is the main justification to start going into power .
rolls are pretty open and mostly depends on playstyle and type of gear vm or midtier right now meta '' is double cdr so your buffs line up better with enrages.for armor the chest roll is sa damage since its your main dps contribution and bottom lines are all the damage reductions all covered in the guides .
armor and boots grounded rather obvious the more defense the more damage reduction the more effective your block is the block amount listed on your weapon is the damage you mitigate after all reductions .
weapon and gloves energetic attack speed and cdr are crucial stats to keep the class fluent
my concern would be what about in cases of harassment ?
i had a friend who was being harassed over snapchat and the entire reason the guy used that particular app was because he knew the content would disappear .
in her case it was mildly annoying and then he stopped but what about a situation where someone might be at risk ?
i would n't want them to hesitate to document something serious for fear of breaking the app rules .

the war maps are designed purely for the purpose of war objectives and really would n't work that well in regular game modes .

its a mixed bag for foreigners when it comes to buying train tickets .
every city differs on how early you can buy train tickets and not all stations offer tickets for departing from other cities .
the earliest i 've seen is 7 days in advance and the latest i 've seen is 3 days in advance and you may not be able to purchase a ticket for destination c until you 've arrived at destination b .
if you 're a foreigner you might have also difficulty buying train tickets in advance because foreigners are forced to purchase/collect the ticket at the station because you need to present your passport in person .
i 've had a chinese friend purchase a ticket for me online but i still had to go to the station to present my passport and collect so you can try that if you want to purchase way in advance .
i 've been fine in both but i would recommend soft sleepers as they are more expensive and will cancel out a certain segment of the population have 4 bunks to a space instead of 6 have sitting toilets as opposed to squatters and there 's a door to shut instead of being exposed to the hallway like the hard sleeper .
based on the places you have picked to travel to i would generally advise you to fly as it will make your life a lot easier unless you 're fluent in mandarin .
the train system is extremely local and it can get frustrating very fast .
the only time i would recommend you taking the train is when traveling to tibet .
this is because you need time to acclimate to the altitude .
for tibet i also highly recommend that you get your visa process tibet travel permissions rolling now etc .
because it can be a very time consuming process and things may change at anytime based on the domestic security environment international relations etc .
i also highly recommend that you buy altitude sickness medication because it can mess you up something awful really fast .

if your core heroes do n't have cleave or ca n't clear illusions fast the better supports are nukers and stunners they 're good at clearing illusions as well as chunking them down to be able to identify the real one .
good carries are tiny ember and od so if you have them on your team you can also pick a different hero rather than one that counters .
the biggest things for teamfighting against illusion heroes is being able to discern the real hero from the illusions and also important is timing if you are the anti-illusion hero you have to enter the fight at the right time whether later or earlier depends on both teamcomps and how they should each play out the fight if you initiate on one hero and then the illusion enemy jumps on you you need someone else to peel for you or be able to tank the damage .
i generally think it 's better you hold back unless you can blow up 2 or more different heroes early in the teamfight with those spells you 're saving for the illusion hero .
it is interesting how your experiences could differ so greatly is n't it ?
iirc the thing is that way fewer cats are brought to the vet after sustaining a higher fall than a lower one suggesting that cats that fall further are less likely to be hurt .

totally fine obviously if it hurts a lot to wear them try and find a size up or if they have a clasp you can use a band size extender should be easy to find online or in a store .
preteen and teen girls wear all varieties of bras and as far as i know there 's absolutely no connection between bra use and development as long as you wear something that fits and does n't hurt you .
sorry for being so negative but you totally expected this .
hurricane harvey was the costliest tropical cyclone on record inflicting nearly 200 billion 2017 usd in damage primarily from widespread flooding in the houston metropolitan area .
it was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country .
in a four-day period many areas received more than 40 inches 1,000 mm of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern texas and adjacent waters causing catastrophic flooding .
with peak accumulations of 60.58 in 1,539 mm harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the united states .
hurricane irma was an extremely powerful and catastrophic cape verde-type hurricane the strongest observed in the atlantic in terms of maximum sustained winds since wilma and the strongest storm on record to exist in the open atlantic region .
it was the first category 5 hurricane to strike the leeward islands on record followed by hurricane maria two weeks later and is the second-costliest caribbean hurricane on record after maria .
the ninth named storm fourth hurricane second major hurricane and first category 5 hurricane of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime particularly in parts of the northeastern caribbean and the florida keys .
it was also the most intense atlantic hurricane to strike the continental united states since katrina in 2005 the first major hurricane to make landfall in florida since wilma in the same year and the first category 4 hurricane to landfall in the state since charley in 2004 .
hurricane maria was regarded as the worst natural disaster on record in dominica and puerto rico .
the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record and the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2017 maria was the thirteenth named storm eighth consecutive hurricane fourth major hurricane second category 5 hurricane and the deadliest storm of the hyperactive 2017 atlantic hurricane season .
at its peak the hurricane caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern caribbean compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the leeward islands already struck by hurricane irma .
maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the leeward islands in two weeks after irma made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and hurricane jose passed dangerously close bringing tropical storm force winds to barbuda .
tmnt spawn beast boy and constantine are bad dlc ideas .
there are 70 mostly producers on here that agree with you .
it 's not a really a waste when it 's freely accessible .
it 's called weed for a reason it grows like a weed .
for people who have limited access to weed me included this would be a waste .
but in reality this is not a lot of weed and is technically veryveryvery replaceable .
run to one of the rest areas and talk to umbra when it prompts you .
you can go back in time to past lucis and level up .
or just meld some magic commands with rare coins and generate some expericast .
i 've been to downtown l.a. am i part of the club ?
its an i teredting coin with staking and mining .
friend of mine in germany is heavy into it from the ico and did well so far .
who knows for sure but it does look interrsting .
if by orgy you mean raiding local hardware stores to demolish their tables then yes yes they will .
it has very few options for food fighting moves no matter how many new moves niantic implements .
there just are n't really any they could add to make it good .
so i do n't think it 'll outclass machamp .
i think you 're rotten mate it 's not to late to change .
as a matter of fact you can use this as a new years resolution ... lol
with hjolfr gone evasa and i continue on down the street to our apartment house .
before we reach the front of the building i pull a slip of paper that my grandfather had given me from my pocket and look it over again just to be sure .
on the slip is the description of the building it 's location as well as our apartment number .
our room would be on the second floor apartment number three already paid in full .
walking through one of the open arches facing the street we enter what looks to be a large open-air tavern taking up most of the first floor save a few back rooms .
there are round polished wooden tables scattered throughout as well as a bar off to one side of the room .
it 's all fairly nicely decorated too understandable given it 's location .
given the odd time of our arrival after lunch and before dinner it 's more or less devoid of people right now save two at the bar .
they 're in the midst of a conversation as evasa and i enter but as soon as they notice us it dies off as they both turn to watch us .
the person behind the bar says aloud an altmer before coming around and approaching us .
he 's tall as altmer tend to be but apart from that he seems very different from the usual a bit like gil is i suppose .
he 's not pretentious or stuffy looking but rugged .
he sports a trimmed beard gray like the short hair on his head .
he has a rather prominent scar across his cheek .
his clothing is n't silks or fine furs but normal functional stuff cottons and tweed .
he seems very much the picture of the kind of person our grandfather would associate with .
before we can respond he starts on again placing a hand on his chin .
let 's see here ... two dunmer aged 20 twins one slightly taller than the other light grey skin and dark auburn hair .
i nod uh yes sera i 'm eno and this ''
the altmer claps a hand on each of our shoulders .
good to know i 'm not losing my head .
but to be honest i recognized you two as soon as you walked in you both look so much like your grandfather it 's damn near scary .
i 'm erundil by the way caretaker of this little corner of sunlock . ''
please the pleasure is all mine when llandryn told me he needed a place for his grandchildren to stay i could n't say no !
not after what we 'd been through together . ''
we made merry little band and i 've plenty of stories to share on the subject but before i start in on that ... hows about i show you two to your room so you can get settled hm ? ''
erundil takes us to the corner of the tavern where a set of stairs leads to the second floor and a rather sparsely decorated hallway .
heading down that we pass by two other doors until we reach room three near the other corner of the building .
you two are lucky '' erundil says producing a key and unlocking the door was just an old man and his dog living here until recently when he left to join his family in leyawiin .
soon as he was gone your grandpa called asking if i had a room available . ''
opening the door erundil guides us into the room walking in behind us .
it 's a spacious well furnished space with the sitting room directly in front of us with a pair of comfortable chairs and a couch .
in the corner on the leftmost side of the room is a kitchen of a sort with some storage and a stove against the wall all separated from the sitting area by a short divider .
meanwhile on the other side of the room a short hallway can be seen with two doors on either side of it .
let 's see so you 've got your sitting room here kitchen on the left side not that you 'll need it with me downstairs i 'm always cooking your rooms are on the right side and there 's also a balcony out front through the door in the sitting room here in case you feel the insatiable need to look down on everyone . ''
evasa shouts running across the sitting room and out the narrow doorway on the other side .
i join her to take in the view and am very much not disappointed .
our room has a view for the first time in well ever seeing as most redoran housing is underground and a nice view at that of the street directly in front of the building .
in addition to the balcony the room has numerous windows as well allowing for a nice view pretty much no matter where you are .
i remark to my sister as we stare down at the street below .
she replies i hardly ever never pictured myself ever leaving baan malur and now look at us . ''
erundil joins us on the balcony leaning against the iron railing .
you two can decide who takes what room they 're more or less identical so it 's not big deal . ''
he replies now take some time to settle in get unpacked and all that .
then come on downstairs and i 'll have some dinner ready .
place 'll be a bit more lively then too you 'll see . ''
reaching into his pocket he produces two more keys and hands each of us one .
and with that the altmer turns for the door waving as he lets himself out .
well ... '' evasa says leaning back against the balcony this is it i guess huh ? ''
it 's a bit of an odd moment where you 're both simultaneously happy to finally be breaking out on your own but also sad and kind of terrified that you left home in the first place .
both our hearts were heavy right now neither of us really needed to say a thing to verify that we could just feel it .
evasa says cheering herself up and attempting to do the same to me and it 's not like we did n't just meet a guy who can literally teleport halfway across the world in an instant so if we need to go home for an emergency that 's doable . ''
i reply not that we should bother him too much ... poor guy seems kind of overworked . ''
yeah he looked kind of tired ... maybe you could learn to teleport ? ''
i laugh i mean i 'd like to learn how i 'm not sure if i 'm anywhere near that point yet though . ''
well it sounded like hjolfr was going to be your primary instructor so i dare say you 'll likely get there sooner or later . ''

i always love when there 's a well spoken figure in the team .
they are good leaders able to get the best out of the players .
this is also a reason i really appreciate steve kerr he 's probably the most well-spoken coach in the league .
so many ex players love the team and miss it so much i really loved when biyombo came to support the players in game 2 against the bucks .
even amir and james johnson really love and miss the team .

they 're just not an accurate representation of coaster rankings .

3. save file as dxf and older versions usually 2007 works best
personally i dont import whole building but just the grids .
for that you should reduce your geometry to only grids and they should be simple line elements not polyline then you can import it to etabs by dxf 2007 file format .

all we definitively know about artemis at this point is the intention to reintroduce animals progressively and not all at once .
we do n't really know exactly what animals have already been reproduced or how far along the progression the animals we see are in the plan .
it could be that the squirrels owls badgers and goats came along at the same time as the foxes geese raccoons trout salmon turkeys rats and boars or you could be right that artemis is continuing to reintroduce more animals .
either way there 's lots of room for a sequel to expand on this .

we were watching all the new features like the base deployables harvesting mini-game modified blueprint system new monuments etc .
fp really added a ton of depth and gave us all a shit ton to do but the upkeep really negates that and bases are weaker than they ever were feels as though the ability to put together supplies to raid is far more efficient use of your time than building anything other than a shit shack to live in because those supplies are infinitely easier to grind for than supplies required to build and maintain a solid base .
simply put i hate knowing that a guy who started today could raid my shit by the evening even though i spent a week grinding the materials for the base and he just whacked a few nodes .
i think that 's the best alternative i 've seen but it 's still not as good imo .

free-to-play f2p or ftp refers to video games which give players access to a significant portion of their content without paying .
there are several kinds of free-to-play games but the most common is based on the freemium software model thus free-to-play games are oftentimes not entirely free .
for freemium games users are granted access to a fully functional game but must pay microtransactions to access additional content .
free-to-play can be contrasted with pay to play in which payment is required before using a service for the first time .

you 're talking about ethics and then talk about objectively saving animals ?

no time like the present to get started just think when your family event comes around you will have already been 2 weeks sober !
i found that distracting myself in the early days was the best thing i could do .
i ate i took my dog for car rides i spent a boat load of time here .
once i stopped worrying about tomorrow next week next month next holiday it got easier and those things took care of themselves as they happened .
new years is not a deal for me so no struggle there .
the family event well ... many of us have similar situations and they are hard no lie but what an amazing feeling it is to make it through one of those stressful events sober .

oh mate it 's okay to say you made a claim you think it 's right based on speculation but you have no evidence .
i 'm not going to judge you for that !
its okay to have theories just do n't pass them off as fact when you can not back them up with anything .
you have n't supplied evidence for either claim you 've made .
i 'm happy to have my mind changed but i need to see evidence .
if you can show me police deployed their oc spray because the cad had a description of sudanese perps i 'll happily say you 're right .
same for your claim media coverage of sudanese crime is driving racially aggravated offences .
it 's not beyond the realms of possibility by a long shot but i would like to see some statistics otherwise it is a theory with no supporting evidence .
call it nit picking if you want i guess .

share your personal struggles with them what has made you depressed and etc relate to them if you can .
be a friend but do n't force yourself to be their friend to protect them .
if it becomes a major strain on your life then it is okay to leave .

i understand what you mean and will keep it in mind when building the character as i absolutely despise the 'special snowflake ' route .
a child succubus is pretty different from what i 'm thinking .
the character i 'm talking about was n't horrible because it was a succubus .
it was closer to the fall-from-grace kind of emotional succubus .
it would have been an okay character if not for it being a kid .
a key concept i do n't think you grasped is that my character would n't be a tired pesky useless kid '' .
that means he would n't be dead weight he would n't be useless in combat and neither in out of combat situations .
you literally said you want the party 's barbarian to be carrying you around .
nobody is going to take a child seriously in a political scenario when talking to impprtant political figures
nobody is going to take a child seriously in a justice-related scenario because you could n't possibly have the mental capacity for it or enough moral character to add anything unless again you play some annoying snowflake .
nobody taking me seriously is not a bad thing most of the times .
if i fail sneaking into something for example i could just try and persuade bandits into believing i 'm lost .
they would n't take me as a threat to them .
i do n't think you understand how cutthroats work .
if you fail sneaking into a bandit camp they 're either kidnapping you or sending an arrow at your neck .
they literally have no reason to think you 're not a threat to them when they intentionally live in complete solace .
same goes for political parties cults and pretty much any other group adventurers usually fight in d d .
i can understand why would are so negative about this kind of character after all you had a negative experience with something similar .
i just do n't even see how you could even be a child geared for adventuring .
you quite literally do n't have time to gain the necessary mental or physical capacity nor the expertise required .
i read all the replies to this thread and think an interesting solution would be the 'oracle ' from pathfinder that user vorpalhammer mentioned .
it would require a bit of tweaking and talking to the dm sorting out the homebrew stuff but i 'm sure something along those lines could work and make for a pretty original character for a campaign
why ca n't you just play an 18 year old ?

by defending a misogynist slight you are normalizing misogyny which is what fucking got us here in the first place .

i thought hey i got ta check that out so i got it when it was released and the game just charmed the shit out of me .
i wish i could go back and experience it for the first time again back when i had dialup and didnt bother trying to look up all about a game first to ruin the surprise .

japan usually finds and spreads the images afterwords not knowing what the watermark means .
the iranian government is already using trump 's word for propaganda .
that moron should shut the fuck up because he has about as much clue on iran 's problems as you do .
the french and americans did n't have animosity when they sent the american rebels aid .
a large portion of the iranian population does n't trust american intentions on the issue and if they see trump 's hand in the matter they will ditch the opposition in no time .

mariah is a fantastic songwriter with brilliant imagery and fantastic musicality .
this post was mainly focused on the vocal side of things but mariah has written some pretty amazing songs as well .
i 'm including some of her work so you can have a listen before deciding whether you want to give her a listen or not .
from daydream underneath the stars http youtu.be/58thmzu8ai8 makes fantastic use of imagery .
on the rnb side of things butterfly is considered her creative peak .
the roof http youtu.be/qi5oxzttjgo is considered by many to be her best work lyrically .
breakdown http youtu.be/bc7v9dn1rc8 is also quite beautifully written and showcases her deft understanding of meter .
after 2005 her singles sort of become same-ish many many rehashes of we belong together so to really get a feel for her as an artist it sort of becomes necessary to delve into her albums .
cruise control http youtu.be/cdqlwm6vayq is a fun bop with obvious reggae influences .
betcha gon know http youtu.be/55lrvbfz4jk proves that mariah knows how to have a song progress musically to accommodate the storytelling in the lyrics .

i was lucky as a child as my grandparents were going abroad and some people they were going with cancelled so my parents got their tickets and also managed to afford 2 extra tickets so my sister and i could go with them .
i was very young and a lot of the details of the holiday/vacation are lost to me i remember my ears popping on the flight trying some nasty grapefruit soda/fizzy pop and almost drowning in a swimming pool .
this is the only time my parents were ever able to afford to take me outside of the uk .
other than this we were able to go on holiday/vacation every couple of years in the next county over where my aunty lived but i grew up not expecting these things never bothered me my parents are amazing people and did well with what they had .
i am a very socially awkward person anyhow so if if we were to go anywhere where there may have been a lot of tourists i probably would have panicked .
i really hope the rumour i heard that they 'll put our more screens for different games is true .

this is because you are playing on a different resolution than your native monitor 's resolution .
this is because you are lowering the pixel density of the game by changing the resolution modifier to something other than 100

if the country socially or by way of law forces woman to wear hijabs then when a woman takes it off ... well i would n't want to force people to celebrate it but it becomes very easy to see who 's not exactly smart and who is n't .
a woman wearing a hijab in america is about as meaningful as a woman wearing a habit or business suit or dressing up like a tomboy .
in countries like iran it is n't that simple .
there 's a context there that looms over the subject of hijab an elephant in the room whether people want it there or not .

it strikes me that a lot of the people who talk about god 's plan '' are the exact same people who will invoke the free will '' argument when trying to justify why god does n't interfere to stop catholic priests from molesting children etc .
or step in to prevent a school shooting etc .
despite the fact that god has a plan for us all '' and god ca n't intervene because he gave us free will to choose '' are mutually exclusive positions .
in the mind of a theist god always has to win .
and they 're not above just making up nonsense to try and justify that .
god does n't have a plan because gods do n't exist .
and when bad things happen all we can really do is try to pick ourselves up and move on .

alright if you dont know my story you can see my previous posts in this subreddit .
short version is that i was losing my job last jan and i started a window cleaning company on a whim .
our goal for 2018 is 400,000 in gross revenue .
my greatest weakness has been bookkeeping so i just hired a bookkeeper and feel sooooooo much less stressed as a result .
this year i will be making a video post at the beginning of each month outlining our monthly goal required to hit our 400,000 target as well as a brief review going over the previous months success/failure .
here is a short video that briefly explains how we came up with each months goals as we did not simply divide 400,000 by 12 https youtu.be/elgidgntlt8 i used some numbers from a company that was kind enough to share some of their records with me that has been doing the same sort of business in my area for 20 years for my monthly projections .
using the profit first '' method we will be setting a 5 company profit for q1 and will evaluate/adjust as the year goes .

i am not a native english speaker so please forgive my ignorance .
when i first learned the word despise i understood it meant to feel contempt .
if i despise a person i consider them beneath myself lowly and unworthy etc .
but now i often see it used as a stronger synonym of hate dislike as in i despise anchovies i despise winter .
they do n't consider winter beneath their notion they just really hate it with a passion .
has it always been accepted usage and i am just misinformed ?
i 'm not sure if this is the correct sub for this type of post but i 'm looking for suggestions about how to cope with the pain i 'm experiencing in the morning .
i 'm 36 years old and feel like i 'm too young to be having this kid of pain .
i wake up and my whole body aches in particular my legs/arms/extremities .
some days my fingers are so swollen i ca n't even bend them .
and the odd thing about the fingers is it does n't occur every day and the occurrence changes on my fingers if that makes any sense it 's completely random .
anything to help me cope would be hugely appreciate !

hi all looking for a bit of advise on how to alleviate this problem i 'm currently having in the cold weather .
my house is about 20 years old i purchased it less than two years ago and i 'm located in ohio where the temperatures have been less than 10 degrees f for the past several weeks .
the copper water lines feeding my kitchen sink are located in a joist bay that overhangs from the foundation wall .
in this joist bay is also the pvc drain pipe from the sink as well as the clothes dryer exhaust ducting it 's rather crowded .
with the weather being as cold as it has been both hot and cold water pipes have been freezing .
there 's no signs of bursting and no external condensation on the pipes and 1-2 minutes of putting a hair dryer to it thaws it out as a temporary fix .
the existing insulation was simply fiberglass batt insulation shoved in the cavity and some wedged behind the pipes between them and the exterior wall .
i took a trip to home depot and purchased some foam pipe insulation the pool noodle kind and wrapped all the hot water piping in the unfinished basement as well as the cold water line inside the joist bay to about two feet inside the foundation wall .
this morning the hot water pipe had frozen again even with the new pipe insulation .
i do n't think foam board insulation will work because of how crowded the joist bay is so i 'm thinking of expanding foam insulation and filling the entire joist bay .
is it a bad idea to use expanding foam around water lines ?
does the heat of the dryer vent pose any risk ?
i 'm currently at work and will post photos once i get home tonight .
it is not necessary but you can listen to part 1 here .

i 'm not an expert on geometry nor geometry pedagogy .
but i do enjoy the new desmos geometry and look forward to using it to teach kids some aspects of geometry .
i do sometimes wonder what it would be like if it allowed me to express lengths and angles as formula particularly based on other lengths and angles .
it would be nice to explore trig functions in that way .
the challenge with trig in the standard desmos calendar is that as soon as you move away from the origin you have to keep track of your reference frame .
another thing i would like in desmos geometry is arcs .
i find that when i am using it for illustration that 's what i most often am missing .

gigabyte ab350 gaming 3 rev 1.0 latest f10 bios ryzen 7 1700 oc'ed to 3.8ghz stable 1.39v on stock wraith cooler corsair vengeance lpx 3200 1.35v 3200 no xmp profile used coolermaster v750 fully modular psu
so i can get the system to boot successfully and it is running cool and stable but only if i 've switched of the psu completely first .
if i shutdown from windows and then try to switch the system back on it will not post and shows me the cpu fault led on the mobo with the system fans all spinning .
strangely when i shut down from windows ... .the usb/ps2 devices appear to stay powered on eg .
then when i power of the psu they will obviously power off then and only then can i get the system to boot successfully after the flea power has been drained from the motherboard and all my cmos settings stay intact ... i.e .
it does n't appear to be an oc issue .
so i 'm thinking is this some sort of sleep/suspended low power mode on this motherboard that i 'm not privy to ?
? ... .i have read a lot of other owners having boot issues but they require cmos resets to work .
i do n't need to do this for the system to boot ... .just power the psu off at the back first .
edit ok guys i lowered the core voltage and upped the clock and i 've actually now got it running at 3.9ghz 1.32v .
i 've kept the ram at 3200mhz for now .
max temps on load are around 66c on stock wraith !
i must have lucked out on the silicon lottery ... so i might even be able to push it to 4.0 or 4.1ghz !
i think the non-boot issue with usb devices staying on after shutdown was indeed down to erp mode being switched off .

i am playing with day trading crypto started watching some of the exchanges last week and jumped in to play with my christmas money on gdax this weekend .
for now my long term goal is to increase my stack in eth .
i 've been researching all i can about day trading and trends but i have n't seen what to do in a situation like last night .
eth jumped up while i was in usd so i thought i would wait for it to drop back down and trade back once i could make gains .
it did n't come back down so finally i decided to just leave my gains in usd and go to sleep .
this is play money anyways so i did n't loose much sleep over it especially since ultimately it 's money not gained instead of money lost .
overall i feel like i made the best choice since usd is stable but in hindsight i would have preferred to be in eth overnight .
so my question is and tl dr if the value is running away from you at the end of your trade day is it better to take the coin loss and trade back into eth or whatever stock/coin you 're trying to make gains in ?
i understand leaving in usd is the safe thing to do but i wanted to get input from someone more experienced .
and i 've read a lot of the do n't do it '' posts about day trading crypto so you do n't need to tell me not to .
is the 的 necessary after laolao or 是 just mean to be in this sentence .

the cover had an asian kid in a flying kick on the cover and the background was orange/yellowish .
i 'm relatively sure that it was a paperback .
kingdom '' but i 'm not sure about that .
the plot was that the chosen one was found by a martial artist who recognized the pattern on his foot and began training him .
i can remember he had to stick his hands in bags of sand and had to jump up and down on a wall with the sand tied to his ankles .
later in his life they went to a school far away and had some adventures on the way .
the protagonist the chosen one nearly drowns as they arrive but is saved by acupuncture .
there is competition at the school for food and there is a scene where fruit is kicked around at him and the protagonist dodges them all .
he gets put in a cell there for a brief bit i think .
the book ends with him fighting some monster in the water that he kills .

those of you who work for a variable income how do you budget ?
i 'm a bartender but i receive all credit card tips on my check and it can vary from 600 if i had to call in sick a few days or something to 2500 on the best week of the year .
i also get anywhere from 0 100 cash a night but usually about 20 .
right now during the slowest part of the year i 'm trying to start saving up enough that i 've got an emergency fund but it 's tough because my husband just passed away and rent is 2300 .
for now though how do you budget for a variable income ?
my credit is trashed nobody else will rent to me and housing here is insanely expensive and limited .

i 'm engaging in a world-building project and i 'm wondering what daily life was like for the average resident of international port cities like nagasaki up to and including the meiji era ?
i 'm using nagasaki as an example but any relatively cosmopolitan port city around the world before 1900 would work well too .
were there any types of characteristics that were conducive to the growth of bustling port cities/trading hubs ?
my basic research indicates that sheltered ports to protect ships was one common factor .
what types of social economic or governmental forces were the most influential ?
what were relations like between trading merchants and local residents ?
how were foreigners in these city kept under control '' e.g .
ensuring that they obeyed local laws did not stray from areas they were supposed to stay in ?
what types of divides tended to afflict these cities ?
were there large socioeconomic divides between the rich and the poor ?
anything else that you think may be interesting to point out or which people commonly misunderstand would be really helpful as well .

so in wake of the logan paul video i had an idea .
first of all i want to make it clear this is not a place to discuss the logan paul video .
this is a place to help let me know if the idea that stemmed from watching it is a good idea .
i am currently in my final year of my second bachelors of science degree .
in my time at my university i have been heavily involved in student organizations .
i 've been in sga student government association engineering student council and student activities board just to name a few .
i 've even represented my university on national organizations and have worked really hard to try to make things better so students do n't feel the way i do now from what was a previously toxic community .
despite doing all of this i truly feel like i 'm a piece of shit .
i am constantly pushing people out if my life that i should n't .
in essence the idea is to put a video together talking about my story if you will .
to ultimately help spread the message that suicide is n't the answer .
and you should not be ashamed to get help or just talk to people .
i 'm curious on whether something like this is really a good idea ?
i have personally found hearing the stories of other 's difficulties and how they deal or overcome them helpful .
as i am largely seen on campus as someone who has their life together and is genuinely happy .
my hope is that it would move people to reach out and get help or at the very least know you 're not alone .
if i receive enough encouragement i will move forward with talking to my school 's student life and my counselor about actually making this video/biography happen .
tl dr as a person fairly well known on campus and involved with a ton of campus orgs i want to tell put a video together telling my story involving depression and even suicidal thoughts .
the hope is that it would encourage people to reach out for help or at the very least know they are n't alone from someone who they may never thought deals with this .
forgetting about which currency is better or has better partnerships etc .
i wondered is it possible for xlm and xrp to actually work together somehow ?
i know xrp is coded in a way that it can integrate with other currencies but i do n't know much about xlm .
so will it turn out to be a pissing contest between them or is it a possibility for them to not just coexist but actually work together ?
here 's the coupon you 're looking for tablet stand holder http couponsfromchina.com/2017/10/20/tablet-stand-holder-coupon-price-gearbest pretty good price !
so i stopped playing d1 when d2 came out because of no loot transfer and people moving to d2 now that d2 is getting worse it there any point going back to d1 ?
our design agency is being paid in shares in a startup for services rendered in 2017 .
we have not invoiced them for our work yet as it will be completed in 2018 .
how would i file the shares being paid to us in 2018 ?
are they only taxable when/if we sell the shares later ?
so i just beat ornstein and smough and seeing how little damage i was dealing i decided to start using a new weapon .
i 'm around level 55 for now building strength and until this point i was using the drake sword with the grass crest shield .
also i do n't want a two hand weapon for now .
so i considered swapping to the zweihander or the large club but in the end i have chosen the man-serpent greatsword since i find it more similar to the drake sword maybe a bit slower with light attacks but i like the strong one
is there any other that i will find similar to this playstile ?
i 'm not talking about our misconstrued constructs about what 's morally acceptable .
i 'm talking about the hypocrisy and the pretentiousness the megalomania that grips each and every person .
we pretend to care about others and want others to care about us but it 's not because we actually care .
it 's because we 're the only thing that matters .
as soon as it becomes convenient we throw others to the side .
so long as we can get our chemical fix we 'll slave away until the day we die spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter .
hell we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures .
sorry but just because we are subjectively more intelligent does n't mean our existence is any less futile or has any more meaning .
sorry to break it to you but god 's not real and why would you even want him to be ?
i may be inserting my preconceived notions as fact but in theme with this post idgaf if you disagree
on this subreddit we all pretend to sympathize with each other but i bet in real life we are all judgemental sacks of shit and i 'm willing to bet that because i know i certainly am .
i like to spout about the woes of man but in real life i 'm a slave to the emotional parts of my brain an introvert with no social skills humor or personality .
i do n't explain this for pity btw i explain this because i 'm quite the hypocrite and i 'm willing to bet you are too .
so stop forcing me to pretend to care about you ?
i have my own worthless ideals that i care about and that you do n't .
for example i think there is a ridiculous age inequality .
for what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect ?
if you 're a fucking idiot and do n't cater to my selfish wants i 'm not going to fucking respect you .
i might be age and a know it all but that does n't guarantee i do n't fucking know more than you .
even if i do n't everyone should n't just assume i do n't and treat me like a fucking child but then expect me to act like an adult .
oh but even though you do n't take my issue seriously i should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego .
time to go waste my time working after staying up late for no reason .
i do n't really know what the point of this post was but i feel like there was a general theme to it .
i 'm too tired to make a main point all i know is that this post and every other post on here is effectively meaningless .
i thought this was a lovely piece https jezebel.com/i-did-everything-you-said-and-im-still-alone-1821345701 .
it 's not as dark as the title makes it seem .
the only thing that alleviates the ache of solitude is showing up for yourself every day and taking a hand in all the little choices that make up your life .
choosing something good for your mental health choosing to spend time with people who like you choosing to smile at yourself in the mirror choosing to meet up with someone new .
i 've got a mug i acquired from an old house mate covered in text that i assume is polish .
there 's a word on it that google translate does n't know .
it has various objects on it with associated phrases .
i 'm assuming it 's either really rude or some kind of slang/in-joke if google ca n't translate it .
or maybe it 's not polish but some very similar language ?
edit also the temp drops to 22c and then jumps to 30c
well first off are these extra files created in the transfer from mac to windows just metadata or are they crucial for the photos themselves ?
could i have lost any photos in the transfer from mac to windows due to incompatibility or will i still have all of my photos ?
i have since organized my photos into different files according to different dates and i am wondering if there is any way to recover that data .
is anyone buying ardor tokens on poloniex post snapshot ?
curious as i 'd like to accumulate enough to forge ardor over 1000 coins and have a raspi3 ready to serve as a node .
my options currently seem to either wait for polo to announce support or trust that they 'll exchange my tokens for coins ?
edit i currently do n't own ardr tokens on polo and ultimately would like to know if the ardor marketplace is the only place i can purchase ardr tokens at the moment .
party of two people trapped in an endless void fissure .
we ca n't end it after the round we are only prompted to choose a new relic not given an option to end .
reddit is opressing and censoring me and not letting me put the whole story here so here 's a link with the whole story .

i ordered a pair of beluga 2.0s from yeezy supply sometime in november i forgot when they dropped
i got order confirmation and shortly after got a tracking number .
it 's been stuck at shipping label for a couple of days while my friend 's tracking number was updating like normal so it was quite strange for me .
i emailed yeezy supply about it and said to not worry about it and that my shoes will get shipped before christmas .
it 's now new years and my tracking is still stuck on label created .
this is what it says on my yeezy supply order page
according to ups your order could n't be delivered as planned .
so then i called up ups and asked about this and all they told me was that the seller yeezy supply did n't hand the package to ups yet and to contact yeezy supply .
no emails have been responded to no help no one has had this problem .
i am also not able to chargeback since it 's been more than a month so is my money gone ?

the following letter is sent out from deepwood motte .
as i understand you and my father have come to some sort of arrangement where my son grendel marries your niece alys .
although my father and brother are away from deepwood i thought i would try and arrange this marriage seeing that as far as i can tell there is no need to postpone the marriage any further .
i assume we 're having the wedding in deepwood motte but if you have any other suggestions i 'd be happy to hear them .
i ordered this to help with anxiety and sleep .
when i was reading i thought i was ordering a cbd product with the minimum amount of thc .3 or whatever it is .
i do n't mind if you call me one i believe i am .
i 'm a novice with the whole cbd thing and just looking for a way to calm at night and get some sleep .
hey lovelies i 'm a complete novice when it comes to makeup .
i recently overexfoliated my face a teeeeeensy bit and combined with this arctic cold my skin is looking a bit blotchy and red .
i never wear foundation or really anything beyond a moisturizer but want for something to help even the tone .
the last foundation i bought about 4 years ago was from tarte .
i liked it but wore it maybe twice and it always felt heavy .
cream or cc cream would be more up my alley than a traditional foundation .
do n't need or want major coverage and will ideally feel like nothing is on my skin while i 'm wearing it .
inexpensive is awesome but i 'm willing to spend on the right product .
my skin is fair no freckles normal and my pores are massive .
acne coverage is not a concern but redness and texture is .
thank you and i 'm sorry if im doing this wrong !
i think one of my favourite drinks is gin and jam https www.tastingtable.com/cook/recipes/gin-cocktail-with-jam-fruit-preserves .
the reason is that there are nearly an unlimited number of combinations you can create depending on the base flavoring and the jam .
typical gin and jam is just gin and simple syrup with a usual sweet jam .
you could even use basil simple syrup and tomato jam though i have n't tried it yet !
there has been a lot of discussions about punting in h2h ... so over the break i took a closer look at the data and put together a simple analysis here http rotoblue.com/punt.html .

good luck and may the roto force be with you !
1 if the chiwoo series from komsco will only include 2016 and 2017 coins or if it will continue in the future ?
2 will the new zi sin coin be part of the chiwoo series as the coin of 2018 or if that is another series of 12 coins and if that is another series will these 12 coins be released one by one yearly ?
3 considering the success of noah 's ark as an investment '' bullion is there of any interest to try to collect them all starting from the 2011 year ?
so in the future some of them may be sold as every noah 's ark in the last x year '' ... actually what i would like to understand in this questions is if the very first coins of an investment series just like maple leaf eagle libertad philarmonik etc etc pick up some sort of numismatic value on the long term if you own every year .
4 will the silverback gorilla from congo continue in the next years or will it be finished after 2017 ?
i know this is an overly broad question so feel free to answer it equal vagaries or not at all
do you believe a modern and powerful nation should provide for some basic social safety net ?
if so where how do you draw that line ?
from u/pilopheces on what is your opinion of the modern welfare state being a conservative idea ?
but it 's sooooooooo much more than being a fan of violent rap .
it 's about living_that ... not just fantasizing about it .
violet rap campe about ... because of the culture ... .
i 'd argue it did n't create the culture .
it 's a by-product of the culture ... an exposition and expression of the culture .
that 's exactly what most early gangsta rap '' artists will tell you .
from u/coach\_dds on why are blacks poor because they are lazy '' but rural whites are poor simply because of being forgotten '' and globalization ?
the minimum wage is clearly not enough to sustain a living
when most people say living '' these days they include smart phones and flat screens .
when i think living '' i think not dying from starvation or exposure . ''
minimum wage is absolutely enough to stay alive and function in a modest existence .
it is not enough to afford you the newest smart phone car lease and your own house/apartment .
from u/suspenderender on why do conservatives lament living-wage policies when that means people who work for a living would n't be dependent on government benefits as much as they are ?

i have a 2015 isport that i am in love with but am upset that the armrest center console lid is extremely loose !

i as thinking about hatred+discipline+purity i 'll shutdown hatred and put mom in skills .
this is probably a dumb question but i was wondering what you do with an offering ?
so ... for example say i left a portion of my meal as an offering to the house wights .
there 's probably an obvious answer here i 'm missing but i am a bit clueless .
i was surprised to see a warning on the dayquil and nyquil bottles that said people with thyroid disease '' should not take the medicine .
i am usually a fairly healthy person but i was really looking forward to taking that nyquil so i could sleep through the night after a few days of having a cold and sore throat .
i 'm sure i took it last year when i had a cold without realizing that i was n't supposed to .
so ... what otc cold medicines do you take ?
also what other otc medicines are we not supposed to take ?
i will ask my doctor next time i see her too !
just unlocked all time dom and been seeing people are having issues with the cpu .
difficulty goes up but i am just wondering everyone 's general consensus of how to make it easier .
some backstory of myself ... i cruised through regular and historic pretty easily only having to re-do one game from not reaching the mt amount last historic lakers .
ive been blowing out the cpu and wondering is all time really that much harder ?
i run handoffs and pitch passes as well that create a lot of space so i often blow by the cpu to the rim or kick out to wide open shooters .
also use rc slips for more action and cuts .
play tight on and off stay home no threes play physical .
i will occassionally off ball if the cpu takes a lead or i am not grabbing boards that should be mine .
other settings are push the pace run in transition and crash offensive rebounds .
i always get the free throw and three bonus that is not difficult for me .
but overall any tips settings playbooks you guys recommend ?
we 're ringing in the new year with a fond look back at the old !
2017 may have been a dumpster fire in the real world but it was full of ambitious entertaining and emotional stories in the anime-verse .
our staff got together to recommend their favorites from the last 12 months .
participating staff members picked up to five titles from three categories
feminist-friendly favorite you 'd recommend it to a feminist friend with no caveats
problematic favorite you 'd only recommend it to a feminist friend with caveats
surprise favorite you did n't expect it to be something you 'd recommend but it was either with or without caveats
the only rule was that the series or season had to be complete as of december 2017 .
shows that are still airing like the ancient magus ' bride were not eligible .
we 've highlighted a couple top picks that received votes from the majority of the staff but otherwise they 're just organized first by category and then alphabetically .
the team has varying tastes as do our readers and we did n't want to try to put those tastes in a hierarchy .
like we said we limited ourselves to a top five and everyone has different tastes .
if there 's something that slipped under our radar and you think it 's a series other feminist-minded viewers would enjoy please let us and your fellow readers know in the comments !
hello after 30 something perfect batches i got customer feedback that an item was damaged .
probaly true since transport was a little bumpy due to ice as a rookie not sure how this will impact me .
what are instacart 's policies on damaged item feedback ?
i recently replaced my i3 6100 with a i7 7700 .
at idle temperature it is around 30-35celsius but when i play any game i get 1 fps and the cpu goes up to 70 celsius .
i removed and re applied the thermal compound and that did not make a difference .
i have a gtx 1060 8 gb ram and a h110m gaming msi mobo .
also when i play a game the cpu usage goes up to 100 .
edit i solved it by downloading the latest drivers for my gpu thanks to anyone/everyone that offered advice !
i have a game where players can edit worlds over lacewing ...
when a player enters a world i need the world to be sent from the server and loaded by the client .
i also need the world to be saved as people place or remove blocks .
also this needs to happen with many many many worlds at once .
i have tried making an array type system but that did n't work at all ...
i was thinking maybe some sort of sql database online but i 'm not sure if that would work either ... also might i mention these worlds ca n't be saved on players pc 's because they could edit the file or delete it .
my game is pretty large task but this is the only thing i 'm having issues with ...
preferably for indoor and outdoor use but primarily indoor .
the thing i 'm most concerned with is warmth .
i have poor circulation in my toes and they 're constantly ice cold .
i am working on a problem set for my stochastic processes course .
pretty sure i made a mistake in the proof i have found for the statement that the set of continous functions is element of the product sigma algebra kolmogorov-algebra .
i would be thankful if someone could check my proof and point out
show that mathbb c mathbb r in bigotimes t in t mathcal a t .
mathbb c mathbb r is the set of real-valued continuous functions .
mathbb r t lbrace f vert f t rightarrow bigcup t in t omega_t and f t in omega_t forall t in t rbrace
it follows that mathbb r t is the set of real valued functions .
mathbb r t is equal to the set of real valued functions so obviously c mathbb r in sigma mathbb r t
my xrb withdrawal says complete on bitgrail but i do n't even have a pending deposit in my web wallet..
when i click on transaction id it says invalid block '' .
lots of people seem to be having this issue .
is this an issue with the exchange or is it raiblocks itself that is having problems ?
it 's a fair amount of money and this is pretty ridiculous..
hey all my friend is switching from ps4 to pc yay .
i put together a list for about 460 which is a price he 's happy with .
i have a g4560 still overpriced to hell yet still a good deal paired with a 1050ti .
i 've never personally by choice put a dual core into anything recently but with the hyper threading it competes directly with a low end i3 .
i 'm a boy 15 and for my grade/age snapchat is a big deal .
people add each other even if they have n't met in real life and it 's how we all communicate .
i 'm wondering how i can start talking to a girl over snapchat it 's practically the same as texting and get her to keep wanting to talk to me .

does it really matter what kelvin my bulb is if i can set the white balance manually in my camera ?
i am struggling to get 5000k bulbs in my country .
so i just started keto and i tried to follow a keto thai green curry recipe today .
added lite coconut milk thai paste and cauli rice bulk of calories but still under 300 for all of them and then added cabbage spinach onions cilantro broccoli and a baby potato .
now i would necessarily think of this as an unhealthy meal .
but it all came to about 750 cals for two bowls but 125g of carbs ! !
fiber 43g so net carbs is still over 80g ! !
i am a volume eater and i like that this gives me 2 full bowls of food but also do n't think i could go without eating anything else in the next 24 hours until i can reset again .
i should mention that i am vegetarian do eat dairy but no eggs so if i do n't volume up on veggies i tend to binge .
are my eyes just adjusted to massive portions and i 'm not realizing it ?
is two bowl fulls of veggies an excessive amount and beyond the expectations of what i should be eating ?
would really like to stick this out but feeling a bit lost ... and hungry
can someone work on the bookofaberoth potency scroll page ?
im too nooby to use the scroll and am curious of the effects it has on all the different scrolls .
i just had my rear shoes replaced and the mechanic has said they needed to grind or plain the disc .
it has been making a intermittent wherring sound when i put the brakes on now .
i know of the animals that live near the poles such as penguins and polar bears .
but this usually refers to the coastal parts of the polar surface coasts of antarctica and the coast of the northern ice sheet .
do any animals live inland and actually close say within 100 km of the actual poles ?
how do they feed themselves without access to plants or sea ?
i 'm looking for basically a decent humbucker and single coil or p-90 sound in one pickup .
clad in a beige trenchcoat covering carbon black body armour harold conrad crossed the gap between two intersecting alleyways .
he glanced over his shoulder and scanned the corridors .
the alleys were empty and silent save for the sound of raindrops pounding against the steel floor .
why do i have to live in the only part of the city that rains ?
doing another double take around the alley he reached in his inner right pocket and retrieved a cigarette neatly rolled in paper pulling his jacket tight to hide the bright red stains on his breast .
conrad took a long drag as the rain beat down on the fag and danced off his coat .
he stood still a moment blew out a cloud of smoke and watched it rise into the rainy night sky .
tucking it into the left corner of his mouth he darted down the alley and into the rain-slicked street still bustling with energy and noise in spite of the storm .
four minutes twenty-nine seconds before the next deep-tube train leaves .
conrad increased his walking speed by fifteen percent and hurried towards thatcher avenue by way of babbage street heavy drops of rain pounding on his head like a wet drum the whole way .
from thatcher he descended into tau ceti 's underground tube system where he caught the white line to the asphodel district stepping nonchalantly over the gap just as the doors closed with no time to spare .
he stood the whole way puffing his cigarette towards the roof of the tram car where the smoke coalesced with the rest of the passengers ' ashy clouds .
aside from a cacophony of coughing and hacking and the odd grunted murmur the ride was silent the whole way through .
the tube car 's doors opened and conrad stepped through in line with the evening crowd commuting to their shifts in by the looks of most of them the factories in the greater gateside borough .
he shuffled along with them just another citizen in a sea of grey and brown .
moving upward out of the metro he found himself in the neon glow of karnaby alley in the asphodel district .
stretching past conrad 's vision incongruous shops theatres gentleman 's clubs and seedy pubs lined both sides of the groovy yellow street .
up above the sky was tuned to a constant video feed of the sky visible from the clear dome above the elysium district .
at the centre sounds and conversations so numerous they became noise like the static in his ears .
he figured the average bloke might feel invisible amongst so many people and so much noise but conrad never felt invisible .
it was the little game he played to keep his mind occupied during the rare commutes home .
there was one above jammy 's casino another embedded in the sign for galaxy 's end pub one under the awning of take 7 two on either side of lady jane 's boutique one in the awning above karnaby boy one tucked under the unlit sign for long john 's wig emporium another in the first ‘o ' of lord john 's two on either side of the sign that implored passers-by to drink coca-cola two along the rubberised tiles that lined the street and five more strewn across the bright neon sign that hung above the centre which read
conrad ducked into a side alley and threw a fag end to the ground .
from his right coat pocket he retrieved another fag and from the opposite side his tokugawa-brand walkman .
he flipped the tape to the ‘a ' side and fast-forwarded to the second track as he pulled the over-ear headphones through his collar and attached them to his ears .
the device made a distinct click and the sounds of the old world filled his ears .
it was a song that resonated with him made him feel only slightly less alone in the world .
but try as he might he could n't recall any of the lyrics .
but when he saw the man with a bold lightning streak across his face he remembered the feeling .
conrad tuned out and walked past three other tube stations before descending to hammersmith station which took him from the asphodel district to the other side of cocytus by way of no fewer than four stops through the greenbridge borough northwark borough redwich borough and oldham borough respectively .
on the other side of the tram car door was the same wet world he had left only fifty-six minutes fourteen seconds earlier .
that time could have been decreased by nearly eighty percent had he taken the asphodel expressway which can purportedly cover the circumference of tau ceti central station in exactly twelve minutes – though in actual fact conrad had clocked it in at twelve minutes six seconds and eleven minutes fifty-eight seconds the last two times he had ridden it .
but the asphodel expressway would n't be running that night .
the one part of his commute routine that never changed was his stop at the local dusk til dawn .
conrad shook off the cold and adjusted his now-drenched trenchcoat .
on that side of the door the pounding rainfall and muffled public tannoy announcements seemed distant as if it were another world .
the shelves that lined the wall were stocked with goods brought in from all over the galaxy jitaku taurus tau ganymede regulus galactus prime and others from corners of the galaxy to which he gave little thought .
conrad navigated the maze of overpriced confectionary treats to reach the holy grail of his long journey home the coca-cola slushie machine .
as he approached it an old world jingle played from the speakers on the side of the machine through garbled static .
it told him to dance and slurp with the beat but he did n't feel like dancing or slurping to any beat .
conrad made an inconspicuous glance to the counter as the brown slush oozed into the surprise cup .
a man in his early thirties stood behind the counter reading the latest issue of the tau ceti times .
without turning his head he retrieved the metal flask from the left side of his coat – just beneath his walkman – and poured it seamlessly into the slurpstream .
without mixing it he gulped the slurpee highball and for a brief rare moment conrad experienced bliss .
the distant drops of rain beating like an off-key drummer the tannoy announcements so distorted he could n't hear how inane they were the relentless ticking of the analogue clock outside the window the soft whirring of his walkman and the people who slurp and all the strange things that happen all came back piece by piece until conrad found himself again in the dreary doldrums of civilian life .
he gently placed the surprise cup on the counter .
oi did n't think i 'd see you in ‘ere again.
truth be told i keep thinking this place will be shut down every time i come back.
we will be if them damn bootlegers do n't stop peddling in the back alleys 'round ‘ere.
conrad placed twenty pence on the counter and turned on his heel slurpee in hand .
it is he said handing him a ten pence coin .
ah i forgot and just as he was about to turn he added oh you reminded me actually pack of the reds .
five point nought four seconds later he folded his paper and sluggishly turned to the shelf behind him .
he placed the pack on the counter at the same moment conrad placed down his twelve quid .
conrad raised his right wrist and glanced at a watch he knew was n't there .
yeah guv ... you would n't happen to know what time it is o'clock would you ?
the clerk looked up from the paper and pointed out the window to the large mechanical clock hanging from the side of the tower opposite the walkway upon which the dusk till dawn stood .
the man behind the counter nodded silently and returned to his paper .
the stark white letters on a black digital screen welcomed conrad to his flat upon coronation street .
the signs made his skin crawl as he climbed the stairs from lower cocytus to upper cocytus to reach tau ceti tenements flat number 117 .
he subtly turned his head to scan the grime-slicked hallway behind him .
everything was still save the raindrops rapping the skylight .
conrad dead at the last door on the left .
just as he was beginning to search for his keys he noticed the door was ajar .
his heart raced as he stepped through the precipice there was light on the other side .
conrad crept through the doorway and carefully slid his hand into his inner right coat pocket carefully watching the shadows dancing upon the wall .
to his immediate left was the den – sparsely decorated with a single couch an armchair and a cathode ray telly – which connected to the balcony the only other exit besides the front door .
straight ahead his bedroom and to the right the kitchen nook which went just past his field of vision .
conrad noted the placement of all the furniture and confirmed it had n't been touched since he left .
aside from the candlelight his flat was just as he left it everything neatly arranged and organised in accordance with feng shui .
conrad stepped silently across the carpet and turned his ear to the back of the flat .
as he neared the corner to the kitchen he heard soft tender footsteps on the hardwood floor .
conrad rounded the corner and feigned a surprised look – not difficult to do as he only had nought point eight seconds to process this information .
he pulled a new pack of cigarettes from his coat and started to pack them against the palm of his hand .
connie ! she seemed just as surprised as him .
conrad threw the cigarettes on the counter and embraced her holding her tight in his arms as he planted a tender kiss on the forehead .
she looked up at him the warm features of her face like candlelight and stared at him with electricity in her exotic eyes .
lin ... you had another week in algol i thought.
i did ... but i 'd rather sit with you in your flat than any island resort in the galaxy she said stroking his arm .
so how about you get changed and we get something to eat she continued with a reassuring smile .
we 'll go up to elysium anywhere you want .
actually ... she began apparently trying to find the words as she went i was thinking maybe we could eat in tonight.
you fancy anything in particular ? he spoke the words as casually he could but his face still static in a state of dumbfounded surprise .
well i was thinking ... we could order from tau tao
and ... we could watch that old world movie you keep telling me about
she reached to the counter and handed conrad a rectangle wrapped in silver paper adorned with a red bow .
she handed it to him with that same bright smile .
a present ? conrad admired the neatness of the wrapping job as he held it in his hand .
i dunno we 'll call it a christmas gift or something.
whatever you say. conrad shrugged his shoulders and carefully tore the tape from the sides of the package .
peeling away the paper revealed a tokugawa-brand betamax videocassette tape emblazoned with an image of david bowie the same old world bard who sang the songs on his walkman .
you 're the greatest woman in the entire galaxy you know that ?
yeah i know. she gave him a coy look and a self-assured smile as she sauntered out of the kitchen .
he had forgotten about the blood stains on his breastplate .
i 'm just gon na get a couple drags first .
good for you ! she shouted from the other room .
then we can cuddle on the loveseat and watch old movies and listen to the rain all night. she let out a satisfied sigh and started turning the rotary dial .
well that all sounds lovely except it 's not a loveseat love .
it 's a settee said conrad as he stepped back into the den .
well any seat can be a loveseat if you 're sitting on it with someone you love.
no make that four orders of dumplings actually and – hang on.
she gave him a knowing look with her eyes .
actually make that five orders of dumplings a couple of egg rolls ... .
as soon as she was out of sight conrad pushed the unwrapped cigarette pack into the rubbish and stepped out onto the balcony .
leaning against the railing conrad gazed out at the hazy grey cityscape ahead of him closed his eyes and listened to the soft pitter-patter rain as he smoked his final fag of the day .
i think the color looks amazing and i do n't wan na look dumb googling csgo m9 sapphire color '' https www.google.com/search ? q=csgo+m9+sapphire+color oq=csgo+m9+sapphire+color aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64l2.6306j0j7 sourceid=chrome ie=utf-8

i deleted my earlier post as i may have had the situation confused .
has anybody ever seen a snesc that functions normally except the led never comes on ?
if i do a factory reset and it functions as if i never put hakchi on it will nintendo know if i try and send it in to get the led fixed or should i just leave it ?
i have my qc35ii connected to both my ipad and iphone both running ios 10 still if it matters .
when i am watching video on the ipad with audio coming from the ipad i wo n't hear my text message ringtone when i get a message on the iphone but i will hear my phone call ringtone when i get a call .
i hear the text message notification if i am only connected to my iphone but i would like to be able to hear it even if i am watching something on my ipad .
just matched 25v25 war on an 11 win streak our clan has 16 th11s in the lineup enemy team has 25 th11s in the lineup all with maxed point defense and eagles .
i 've been reading a lot about the ios mobile device management mdm protocols as part of a side project/learning exercise i 've been working on .
i started trying to create a simple ios mdm .
i 've been able to get all of the basics for that up and running .
after that the idea occurred to me to extend it a bit more to serve as an mdm solution to provide better parental controls on my kids ' ipads .
in doing some research on how i could accomplish this i found a couple of commercial solutions like curbi http www.curbi.com mindmake http www.mindmake.com screentime https screentimelabs.com and others that provide something similar .
i noticed that a lot of those solutions say they provide functionality to limit screen time for example lock the device between the hours of 9 pm and 8 am or put apps in a timeout '' where they ca n't be used .
my question is how exactly are they accomplishing this ?
i 've read the ios mdm protocol documentation https developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/miscellaneous/reference/mobiledevicemanagementprotocolref/1-introduction/introduction.html and have n't found anything that would indicate that this type of functionality is supported .
there is a devicelock '' command that instantly locks the device with its passcode .
however there 's nothing to stop you from unlocking it again if you know the passcode .
there are installapplication '' and removeapplication '' commands but nothing that would provide prevent this app from being launched until 8 am '' functionality .
does anyone know how these companies are doing it ?
are they requiring the devices to be in supervised mode ?
even then i do n't see a ton of mdm commands that would be relevant to this .
i 'm not looking to develop some competing solution or anything .
this is really just a learning exercise to give me something to do in my free time .
i transferred eth to binance and the transfer was confirmed .
however i am not able to buy any coins yet with the funds i click 25 on a buy order and it says 0 .
does it take time to process even after the deposit confirmation ?
if a game does n't have a price next to it means i 'm not looking to sell but open to offers/trade .

i used to play st-i a lot but then went for is7 as i prefer this tank much more since years ...
now in the game whether i sidescrape the upper hull frontally is an easy pen for heat or gold or what ever thats getting totally annoying .
so i hide my lower plate but then i offer them to shoot my upper hull which is an easy pen with heat .
not everybody knows it and not everybody shoots gold but every experienced player does and my heavy becomes obsolete ...
he 's the obnoxious centrist whose only position is one that allows him to feel superior to everyone else .
it made a difference it helped placate some masses and fool them into thinking they actually cared about the voters concerns .
nothing to do with cameras they are just incredibly rare well at least according to the announcer at the air show i was a a wile back .
ah i see what you said in the beginning does n't necessarily match everything else .
i 'm curious as to what you were using with her ?
it seems the only times she is recommended is with certain other monsters did you use them ?
had the opposite problem with a winter beater car i just bought..
car is canadian so it came with a whole special computer for the daytime running lights .
it had a bunch of open circuits in it and the po fixed it by grounding one of the headlights directly to the frame resulting in high beam always being on..
i was not expecting but not surprised to find that that was a lazy fix not just a hack job rewire the plug was also burnt to shit .
anyway going through the factory service manual a couple hundred times and a few hours with a multimeter and soldering iron and i have one fixed computer and two working high and low beams .
one low beam is still dimmer than the other but hey i 'm not a magician .
this sounds similar to game of thrones but with a lot more single women and crying and old boyfriends and more crying and drama .
while i do n't agree with all his choices both taylor swift songs are fine and both imagine dragons are kind of meh for me i get the reasoning behind all his choices .
if he is doing multiple artist per list i wonder how many kendrick songs will make the best list .
yes and if you qss malz ult you still get the full dmg of it .
you just qss the cc part not the dmg .
yes they were the way we are viewing alabama currently vs the long stretch after the auburn loss has a ton of disparity .
they definitely get the benefit of the doubt but there were alot of questions surrounding the team

the problem is people are trying to have a subreddit for something that complies with reddit 's rules but it 's so borderline that loli does eventually get posted and gets the sub accused .
then trolls come in and spam loli to get the place banned and the admins want no part of it so they shut it down .
you got ta have crazy good mods to keep that from happening and it does n't help that anyone can draw a loli and say yeah she 's 18 . ''
now it 's 2017 and eas name is mud but you should n't be worrying yourself with video games you need to be working a job you hate in a world full of self absorbed assholes who keep trying to change everyone else to fit their own interests .
i know it 's 2018 but nothing major has happened yet .
seems like i would have seen a reminder to book ihg properties because u can always cancel and rebook if they go down .
would n't have affected me anyway i 'm just curious for next year .
i really really enjoyed it but it did n't have any emotional effect one way or another .
i was never a fan of shiro but given the plethora of snarky npcs in d2 perhaps he would actually be a welcome addition .
r/movies confused do n't know what to think requires guidance and explanation
i did n't know there was even a way to check .
i 'm here wondering why this has 49.2k up votes for something that is not that impressive .
i 'm fairly old and have played a lot of games and this means nothing to me .
self medicating has nothing to do with someone personality .
everything you just said was a regurgitation of what i said because your too fucking stupid to come up with something original of your own .
i thought reddit was a forum for asking questions .
are you proud of yourself for acting hard and tough on a social media website ?
no these side '' movies are a safe bet why take a chance with them
what esfj attributes do you feel like you struggle with ?
yeah i 've heard the rumor as well and i could never find the source of where it originated .
i feel it could be taken out of context as it would make no sense for a dragonfire shield to not work against dragon fire .
what confuses me is that even if people have already prepped ds2 like a week early how can it be declining so rapidly ?
i do n't think the supply of dfs 's outweighs the demand by that much if we assume that people are holding onto their dfs 's .
one more thing i always do when using a perk pot i add 1 additional scoop to the pot .
the way i 've heard the feeling described is like how you feel when you 're starting to catch a cold or the flu which makes sense because your immune system is on overdrive in both situations i think .
dog eggs are really rich in vitamins and minerals !
good to know any way to make sure/know in advance that they 're guarenteed ?
right click and go to properties and find the set launch parameters option and make sure it 's blank .
i went through the 'thinking st anger is actually a good album ' phase .
first of all to be fair '' fuck that phrase but 2nd she did n't fucking rape anyone so she should n't be punished the same as a rapist
vegeta is just more interesting to me as a character now .
vegeta is a proud uptight and on edge warrior always on the ready for a fight .
however he develops feelings for a human woman and even has a child with her .
he struggles with the idea that he actually loves and cares for his family and as much as he 'd like to think he could go without them ?
an actual factual god of destruction can slap his wife and he will go apeshit to defend her .
kiiiiinda just focused on always being stronger was never much of a father or husband and just keeps getting stronger without there ever actually being any development to his character .
he just punches a dude it does n't work he punches a bunch more until he 's strong enough to punch the dude into not punching anymore .
he 's not that interesting of a character and he 's not even much of an underdog anymore .
i 'm sorry y'all got mad not that i made the video ''
i 've taken all the german classes at my community college 2 semesters lol so i know basic stuff but now enough to put on a resume .
i knew that it was outlook but i figured you would know what i meant and i 'm really tired .
i do n't know adobe but i 'm a super quick learner .
i got to say i have a lot of practical skills for someone with not a ton of experience .
it 's just hard to include without putting a strange and unconvincing section on it .
also my friends consider me the go-to for editing papers and doing practical job stuff like writing cover letters etc .
i do it for the same reason and just to get myself ready/psyched up for the race but does it not have an effect ? i know it does n't heat up the tires but there was an empty box iirc video that showed it actually worked to clean marbles off the tires after they made marbles a real thing .
yes they did the movies and gt and super to an extent i honestly think toriyama is 80 retired
does n't every infj ever put all their eggs in one basket for the person they care about ?
other than that i completely agree on the door slam .
although i would n't take this as a lesson because that could mean really putting the walls up and blocking potential friendships or more out .
he 's talking about doorslamming people towards whom you have developed feelings .
i guess you would not longer consider it a friendship and you need to care for yourself in the first place
people who ca n't accept that there are things they 're ignorant of .
yes is the same seed so is only time to show up xd
as a straight man i spent equal amounts of time staring at both of them .
i have zero trust in spec listings in store displays .
excited ka na sana yun pala iba when you see the item .

mental illnesses have great stigma attached to them which is why i made this post i want to be aware of my own bias and incorrect opinions .
fwiw do n't take your ex 's action close to heart .
i know it hurts but i 'm my opinion someone not willing to put actual work in a relationship is someone not worth dating .
i do n't think i 've done 7600 things in my entire life !
i 'll save you some despair by letting you know god has played a cruel joke on you and your fan base .
you will get shit out and not even make it past the 50 yard line all the while bama kicks like 10 fgs .
hi noct how did you guys elysium team get some many kills with only one deck ?
notice you 're using main deck with tonberry suit and only growing eggs .
ps ranked 700 using main and sub decks with great gospel .
while also confusing everyone on what this pendulum thingy is.
they do n't make fun of me for it .
i 'm not waiting for the one but i 'm also not losing it to some chick i just met and we go to a back alley of a bar at 3 am .
i also do n't know if i should tell the girl .
that 's why i 'd want to build some rapport first .
i think i have a good shot this year .

i thought the implication was strictly that the director tried to overwrite her at least temporarily .
it was n't clear whether it was punitively or to create some outcome .
i assumed vincent forbade any photos/voice recordings and she defied that rule when he was sleeping .
i do n't see how taking a photo of vincent would be any different than taking a photo of any other traveler .
i do n't believe him not dying has any material effect other than screwing up the plan . ''
caity and a few of the others play it off like a joke but notice how some of the actors specifically brandon and nick look a bit miffed about it .

it 's a poster not a concept art ... but just look at the facts it 's the same suit from the end of spider-man homecoming and that 's black for sure ... not just because it looks like black but it 's confirmed d and they use the same suit for avengers infinity war ... and in the trailer the suit is black and red ... and while yeah the light are tricky it 's clearly not blue ...
happened to me and my girlfriend on some old strong lsd it was not very fun hearing every thought we each had there is a reason why thoughts are private .
the only advice i can offer is that as our society becomes more transparent and as the internet connects our consciousness more and more .
one day everyone on the planet will be telepathically linked like this .
we have to learn how to control our own thoughts and use them wisely .
it might take another couple of hundred of years until this occurs .
lsd seems to help us evolve towards oneness with all that is
whenever mahrez plays with his head screwed on or if he has a point to prove he is brilliant .
he was only inconstant last season when he was trying to move elsewhere and was distracted .
i just realised you downvoted my comments 😂😂😂😂 your so god damn desperate
i agree with your one point the most saban prepares the best with so much time .
because i criticized him for his policies not his skin color ?
or do you have a cite tucked away that shows that every criticism of president obama was racially motivated ?
for the 30 of people that support president trump does it matter if it 's because he has an r after his name or because fox news tells them to or because they think his wife is hot or because they 're brain-damaged in some way ?
all that matters is that they support him and it 's impossible that they 'll ever vote democrat .
we worry about convincing registered republicans that their side is so polluted and toxic that it 's not worth going to the polls .
several reports say that china officials called the white house but this was before the whole watergate nonsense so the information was deleted
the essential problem with this and similar threads is that you 're avoiding putting in the work to address your shortcomings .
early in my cs career i was absolutely terrible when it comes to computer-science terms .
my initial reaction was to seek out ways where i could interview successfully without putting in the time and effort to improve a fairly significant hole in my interview skills .
this mindset probably cost me a lot of job-offers .
i 'd ace code-tests frequently but then embarrass myself and fail the interview by being unable to answer questions about common computer-science terms .
eventually i got over my own stubborness and ego .
now reading up on common cs terms is part of my interview preparation process similar to how a lot of people practice code-tests for interviews .
patching up that giant hole in my interview skills has helped me many times since .
if you want to be successful you should really address the underlying hole in your interview skills that you 're avoiding .
asking if i 'm waiting for the correct bus at the greyhound
i would love to do that but i 'm way too scared .
if i said i was headed out in service my mom would ask with who .
if i give a name then she would contact the said person to validate .
she does n't trust me despite that i 've given her no reason not to .
1200 should get you a nicer/bigger one room depends if you are talking cold or warm though .
i live 25 min from the center in a rather nice/new place with balcony new lift new floors etc .
and pay a decent bit less than that for my 1 room apartment .
in the end you take whatever you get though ... .
holy shit now this is how it should have ended haha .
like no i do n't wan na listen to your terrible rap .
there are 1000 's of other choices on the same site that are a lot better than you .
by the way this is n't directed at all of the kids who post on soundcloud .
i 'm talking about the kids who rub it in your face and are constantly like listen to me on soundcloud i 'm insert really original '' name here and have the link up on their phone by default just so they can fit in and be popular .
there is no reason to taint a potential witness with a bunch of information they do n't need .
and yeah if there is no conviction then there would n't be anything to give access to yet .
plus especially if the guy has n't pleaded then op as a potential witness does need to have his information limited .
took a look at his comment history and jesus if that's on reddit i ca n't imagine how many people are like that irl
dude those are some screwed up priorities from your parents .
i 'd get it if sharing a room was financial but it sounds like that is not the case .
and it is screwing up your health and back then was neglecting your safety by having you climb to the bunk and not fixing the bunk stairs .
when i was around 11 or 12 my parents and i lived in a 3-bedroom house .
i 'm in one room parents in other guest bedroom in 3rd .
one day my dad 's friend from school needed a place to crash so he stayed in the guest bedroom .
nice thing for our family to to for a few weeks right ?
my parents would always talk behind his back about how awful it was he was staying for so long and how stingy and freeloady he was but never kicked him out .
my parents had a very strange sense of boundaries .
my nmom would overcontrol me to the extreme all growing up on all aspects of my life but they allowed people to freeload off them for months and months .
what kind of fucked up example was that setting for me ?
anyway after the dude moved out my parents turned that room into a storage room .
when my grandparents came to live with us for a few months they put them in my room instead of the guest room where they put mountains of their crap .
i initially got into this game towards the end of the open beta because it had heroes from blizzard universes and i wanted to play as them .
i had no previous moba experience nor any interest in playing a moba game but being able to play as arthas ?
and i ended up loving it so i started to learn it .
fast forward to several years later and hots has been my go-to game for that time period and i keep coming back to this game because i feel like i have invested too much of my time into it to try anything new even if i may find an objectively better game to main '' if i tried .
i have tried every hero out i know how all of them play i know how to play against them i know the maps the strategies i follow the news .
i feel like i ca n't be arsed to put in enough effort to learn a new game as well as i did this one even if said game may be incrementally better than hots .
it is important to note that i started playing this game when i was still a student with mountains of free time and i could easily play tens of matches per day allowing me to thoroughly learn the game .
nowadays i work a full-time job and have other responsibilities which at best allow me several matches per day and occasionally none at all .
for that hots remains a convenient game to keep playing since i already know it and the only things that need learnin ' are the new heroes and maps which i try as they come out and the various meta shifts due to buffs/nerfs which i find time to follow on the forums/reddit during lazy working hours .
more importantly hots matches do n't take too long allowing a casual drop in-drop out kind of gameplay where if i have around an hour of free time i do n't need to worry that i wo n't be able to finish even a single match in that time .
and last but not least the ever-growing map variety which as far as i 'm aware is the biggest in the genre .
it 's just really great to be able to play for an afternoon or even go through several days ' worth of gaming time and never have to play the same map in that time period .
variety is the spice of life and hots provides plenty of it .
i do n't live in a very developed country .
having it sync and burn through my data allowance on lte when i want to view them on mobile and slowing down my upload speeds and download speeds at home while they 're syncing are enough reasons .
het gaat erom dat een afwijkende etniciteit over het geheel genomen een negatief effect heeft dat gecompenseerd kan worden door mensen hier en daar en steuntje in de rug te geven .

that was kind of my point that people who are n't technically homeless might still be lumped in to the 1 in 10

that hoe over there they are high school girls aged 15-17 who wear a lot of makeup and post revealing photos on instagram and look a lot older than they actually are .
the worst part is they usually have 1000 followers most are strangers i assume so anyone can be looking at their photos and saving them .

if facebook is being forced by the german government to censor americans in america that are not violating any american rule then that is a very serious problem .
it is one thing to ask it is a very different situation if the german government penalizes americans in america for not following a german law .
do you think that germans in germany should be required to follow american law or say russian law ?
i do n't particularly enjoy black eyed peas but this looks really good .

i 've played alot of csgo which encourages low sens so i 'm used to it .
the biggest adjustment from 1600 to a lower sens is you use your arm to aim/flick instead of just your wrist which people say gives you a better range of control .
i personally experimented with higher sensitivity in the early time of pubg since you spend more time turning/flicking your camera but i found it was harder to spray down accurately on higher sens .
definitely feel like on lower sens that it 's easier to pop someone 's head straight away once i got used to it .

i get people will point to kapernick and say harbaugh had a running qb but that was n't because of harbaugh 's offensive style .
he literally had kaep running zone read out of the pistol while he was in san francisco .

you 've shown when the democrats gave up on states rights .
this has lead to the difference between the parties being coined liberal and conservative .
there is no federal vote i can think of where states rights have been restored by either party .
both parties are vocally against each other but their bipartisan compromises have only determined the speed of which federalism takes hold and on which right would next be stripped .
it is easy to point a agreeable social changes .

reading replies above i assume it does n't matter if i get it wrong first time haha thank you !
same day i looked for another job and my life has improved a thousand fold .
edit i got the job i found after the review .
it is revealed that holdo actually knew the hyperspace tracking only worked on the cruiser not the transports.meaning holdo knew they could 've hopped on the transports at any time and just hyperspaced away without any issues .
this is the first i 'm hearing about the tracking thing and the rebels ' knowledge of it or maybe it was in the movie and i just do n't remember it but playing devil 's advocate
if they immediately loaded up into a transport and hyperspaced away the that would give away that they knew how the first order 's tracking worked .
however if they make it look like they 're just trying desperately to get away for a long period of time and just happened to finally load into their last ship which happened to be a transport after seeming to suffer heavy losses then the first order has no reason to suspect they know how to thwart their tracking and can continue to construct contrived scenarios where it just keeps appearing like the rebels just happened to get lucky yet again .
eventually the fo would get wise but they could play that trick one or two more times before the fo figured it out .
otherwise the fo might just assume the rebels figured they just decided fuck this they 're dead anyways '' and broke off pursuit .
it really is what they need right now i 've seen so many people on this sub that agree with this .

it 's obvious he was talking about the western half and even then by the late empire period it was clear that the empire 's border had massive flaws and not only in europe but in the middle east as well .
what saved byzantium was their peculiar and thought out defensive settlements the primary being of course constantinople .

it was explained pretty well elsewhere that dom 's complex schemes focus on confusing qbs .
it works well in the regular season when half your opponents have average or rookie qbs but when you get to the playoffs all the qbs you face are good enough to read those schemes and it does n't work .
qbs have evolved in the past 10 years and most at the nfl level are good enough to overcome his schemes but he never really adapted .
he had a great mind for defense but the game just outgrew him .
i think rodgers was able to cover up that outgrowing for a long time but this season exposed it .

i think your question was a fair one considering language is naturally tending towards integration and conflation .

i never found a use for it that a stovetop griddle pan or oven could n't accomplish .
plus the older ones like i had did n't have removable grill plates so cleaning the huge thing was always a challenge .
things always burned toward the back where the hinge pressed tighter and barely cooked at the front where there 's no weight on the lid .
and then is has to be stored somewhere and keep enough counter space to use it ... just not worth it .

i hate how the narrative is always uber '' versus taxis '' .
we need to remove the uber brand from this conversation and refer to it as what it is ride sharing .
if the brand uber is doing hanus things and i 'm not saying that uber is or is not then it 's competitors will eat them alive as they die in the court of public opinion .
i hate having to tell people on friday/saturday night when they ask me where the best place to hail a taxi is that the answer is seattle .
taxis do n't even take dispatched calls on the weekend evenings will refuse to take people if they are outside of a small radius of downtown because they want to stay close to downtown and there 's no guaranteed way to get one .
on nye i had a friend walk all the way home from downtown to 70th and granville without seeing an available taxi allegedly .
the only thing that i know for sure is that the taxi mafia needs to go .
but leading with that statement tells me it 's a shill and not genuine .

what the other responder said it is an abnormal fuck up on a highway and a big enough one to kill someone .
assuming tax code has n't changed there recently looks like digital services media are considered intangible in ny and should be tax exempt .
i understand that it 's complicated for peloton as a company since each state handles slightly differently but more than half of all states may be tax exempt for the subscription and it seems they may not be handling it thoroughly enough and likely charging sales tax to many consumers when they should n't be which is bad for us paying it and bad for them as it 's against tax law .
many will still have sales tax on the actual physical bike though .

there is guidance and standards nowadays for contemporary dwellings but for properties dating from the 1970 's it would be hard to confirm without doing an invasive survey .
one thing you could do is drill through your front or rear wall to determine the thickness and construction makeup say 65mm brick 50mm cavity 50mm insulation and then 100mm block and plasterboard sheeting and you could guess that two of the masonry leafs would be built side to side at the party wall to form a thicker leaf .
if you had photos an area or even a close up picture of the wall through a window opening it could help .
or speak to your neighbour to see if they have any idea .
i started in september before worldwide release but not at the start .
of course it 's possible to get the same opponent twice usually the timing does n't match since one guy is opening lockers or reloading the game from a rage quit so you have to judge and time it accordingly still does n't always work .
why did you even push to get legendary rank if you 're not prepared to play against the top ranks of course they 're going to have better cards/skill .
you chose to try and rank up and quit locking to gain ranks will only get you stuck since you 'll have to play against higher rank eventually

understandable if my internet dropped out but my ps4 crashed so i turned off and on and was able to immediately rejoin but little did i know i still lost 50 sr. now i know their system wo n't know but why not if you rejoin and win only gain say 5 or even 1 sr because you would be considered the worst player on the team .
i 'm not expecting any love from this but there 's honestly no incentive to rejoin it 's a massive dick move but if the only consequence is 10min penalty from my next comp game and lose 50 sr compared to lose 50 sr there 's no point rejoining .
if it happens again i 'm going to look to solve the problem which maybe keep it off for a bit which people have recommended .
not turn it off and on an immediately rejoin knowing that i 've lost the 50 sr and hope it does n't crash again .
so i ca n't remember from last patch but it appears like i have to pick up and exfil with the case from customs and then plant it in factory and exfil with no deaths or else i have to start over and get the case again .
i could have sworn once you had the case you could make multiple factory attempts without having to do customs again ...
recently one of the coins that i have been hodling for what seems like an eternity finally broke out of it 's shell .
you probably already know what project i 'm referring to but for all you die hard skeptics it 's rlc .
the iexec goal is to perfect decentralized blockchain based cloud computing other projects you may recognize in this space are golem gnt and sonm .
although once you delve into the details it becomes clear that iexec stands out as the superior .
now before the angry mob fires the shill harpoon through my heart take a second and hear me out .
the iexec team is one of the most qualified in scene of crypto they already have a working dapp store that features request network req and they actually deliver on their deadlines .
but you do n't have to trust my word you guys should check out rlc and see for yourself .
i would like to restate that the point of this post is not to shill rlc it is to bring attention to a project that deserves recognition for solid achievements .
it truly surprises me that this project is mentioned so rarely on the sub so i want to get a conversation started .
for those of you who are considering investing please do your own research first .

the design compared to say youtube dark mode or even reddit on night mode .
the slight gradients and soft consistent grey color scheme makes it such a great music steaming app especially at night !
it 's not at all hard on the eyes like the above mentioned .

i have an ifttt applet defined for turning on my onkyo receiver but what i want is to extend that so that it will turn on the receiver then after a short delay change the input to a specified source e.g .
is there any way of stringing a couple of actions like these together with a short delay between them i.e .
i was thinking about how some npc multi battle partners have a possible roster of pokemon for team and strategy variety .
does that sound like a good idea to implement into the gym/trial/whatever-comes-next-league system ?
i apologize in advance if some of my information seems off .
my chiuahaha mix was brought to the vet as an emergency between 1 1/2 2 years ago give or take .
she was diagnosed with addisons and was prescribed a couple different types of medicine .
a shot once a month and a oral medicine she takes daily .
during the emergency visit she was given a larger dose .
afterwards we were prescribed a daily dose of .1ml .
the dog has lost significant weight since the emergency .
during a routine check-up the vet has told us a mistake was made with her dose .
that the weight loss might be attributed to the incorrect dosage .
they instruct us to take a new bloodtest and increase her dosage to .6ml .
now i do n't pretend to know more than the vet does .
but this seems like a huge increase to her daily '' prescribed dose .
after we stabilize her we are going to get a 2nd opinion from a different vet .
what are our options in regards to the current/past treatment from the 1st vet ?
if this is not racism i do not know what is .
this is beyond shameful in this day and age .

i am very excited and nervous to present the most personal project i have done in my life and in this 2018 i hope to put an end to what has been a beautiful journey .
three years is a long time ... it gives you to be able to visit the arctic circle fall in love and get angry with it many times .
from all this i have tried to capture the places and people that i have met as i see them .

is this game like the final fantasy series where each release is it 's own independent thing world story etc ?
or are the worlds and stories of the previous games part of the same world and bigger storyline ?
edit thank you for the patience in explaining this to me everyone .

i 'm new to this whole political discussion and i 've really enjoyed the conversation here .
a post yesterday got me thinking about unions and their effect on the free market .
sometimes it seems that unions force employers to do things they would n't otherwise do .
on the other hand generous employers do n't need to worry about unionization as much because employee satisfaction remains high and current employee do n't want to jeopardize that .

i have been learning programming for the past year in c c java and php and so far the job offers in portugal are very limited to web development .
i have no idea what artificial intelligence or operating systems jobs are like or if they even exist but i 'm very curious about how to jump on the boat .
so far my school projects are alot about web development and to be honest i do n't find it entertaining at all .
i wanted to be one of these guys behind complicated c or c development but i do n't know how to get started on those more complex projects since they feel kind of overwhelming .
i 've learned alot about using pointers and malloc but i do n't feel quite ready to delve into that space .
any sugestions to help a crazy fellow into this world ?
recently i 've been gaining interest on space technology but i ca n't find any of information on the software they use up there .
i once found something on github written assembly but i had no idea about what was i reading .
i ask these questions because faq do n't satisfy me enough and i want a career that can make me happier than web development so sorry if this has been asked and replied before .
i swear i 'm getting about ten last exception notifications a minute .
i have no idea what 's causing it i 've looked over the last exception files but i ca n't make sense of them .
before i start tearing apart my mods file i wanted to see if anyone else was experiencing this issue with wickedwhims mccc or basemental because those are the biggest mods i have and seem to be the most buggy at times .

i 've been reading through a bunch of posts lately trying to get a handle on all the quirks of this diet .
i had planned to do keto for january but after hearing about zero carb on a joe rogan podcast i was intrigued and wanted to give it a try .
currently i 'm on day three of zero carb and have a few basic questions that i hope you can all give me some insight on .
first i 've been cooking everything in butter as an animal product is there any considerations i should make with this ?
i would be happy to substitute but it just makes everything taste so damn good !
second how much of this diet needs to be red meat ?
i had a rib eye last night and would do that every night for the whole month but it just wo n't fit into my budget .
i am also trying to lose weight and would love to substitute in some leaner fish or eggs for a majority of my calories every few days .
as far as meat is concerned what are your best/tastiest ways of preparing and eating cheaper cuts of meat ?
i thought i might meal prep for the remainder of the week tonight by slow cooking a chuck-roast and would like to get some burgers ready but ca n't really imagine myself choking down a burger without any sauces/cheese like i can do easily with a steak .
lastly what have your experiences been in losing weight on this diet ?
i had amazing luck with keto and dropped from around 250 to about 200 when i first tried it about a year ago .
i am around 230 now with the hopes that i can get back under 200 and look good for a trip coming up in the spring .
just looking for some anecdotes to hear how this worked for you i 'm planning on lifting weights 3 to 4 times per week .
thanks in advance for your thoughts i 'm glad to have found you guys !
i 'm wondering if there are any offline password managers for the brave browser that are also free .
so i found an old thinkpad r61 sitting in a pile of well old pc/laptop parts and the owner said i can have it for free '' provided i help them clean out the small storage space it is sitting in what can i do with it ?
machine seems okay just minor scratches on the lid surface and some dust on the surface .
can this machine still be brought/upgraded to relatively useful levels ?

here 's a list of the qbs who won at least one of the 51 superbowls .
how many were won without a solid competent legitimate franchise qb ?
the conclusion you have to draw is that without above average play at the qb position you 're facing very long odds .
if we think one of the qbs coming out is going to be an above average nfl qb then we have no choice but to take him .
love seeing the interesting selection of stuff available online here however sometimes to scratch that itch need to actually feel something in my hands if that makes any sense .
so was wondering if anyone has somr recommendations of lcss in the dfw both in terms of selection and possible buy backs .
my prediction is that this match is going to be awesome .
they have built up the heat so well too .
easily could be the match that steals the whole show .
i 'm picturing something like a raised highway but holding water instead of cars .
i imagine it has a weight limit but i wonder if the weight of the actual boat traveling along the canal affects that limit .
i 'm assuming the canal is deep enough to accommodate the draft of the boat .
im a returning player and started a new character to get to grips with everything again but now that i 'm at end game i 'm not sure where i should be putting my efforts since there is now so much to do .
i guess the main goal now is to collect gear sets and classified gear not sure the best way to go about that ?
also i see people saying how important caches are for gear and guns but i seem to get fuck all out of them .
i probably have a bout an hour or so a day to play so ca n't do everything .
i worked my way up to a 2k mythic score before christmas break to get invited into higher keys .
now after my break everyone wants 2k5 score for higher keys because it was so easy to complete them .
why does a combination of the 2 easiest affixes even exist ?
i ca n't find anything on this except that it is supported in firefox focus .
which is nice but i like tabs too much .
is it because they want to force you into use firefox 's synchronisation ?
i like many of you have become recently obsessed with this game .
in my 40 or so hours playing this game i 've noticed a couple glaring problems with units progression .
a soldiers are outclassed by snipers and do not fill a role well .
as it stands right now snipers are straight up better than soldiers .
once you get access to snipers there is very little reason to produce them .
it is better suited for you to start massing snipers as soon as the tech is reached and give your snipers all of the experience for veterancy .
i suggest that the soldiers be made to fill the role of mobile quick response trash clearing units .
these changes will make them more effective at clearing weak unarmoured units but less effective at fighting more highly armoured and higher health pool enemies .
i think their cost/upkeep values are fine the way they are .
b snipers are simply too strong for their current point of accessibility .
there is basically no reason to build units other than snipers from the solider centre after you have researched their technology .
they attack far do high damage and even have high dps once they become veterans .
their stats right now i think are fine for a foundry tech unit .
limiting access to snipers to the foundry will have a snowball effect .
you are no longer capable of producing many snipers to handle the mid-game hordes .
i suspect this will make the mid-game more difficult and interesting as expanding defending becomes more challenging without the sniper deathball .
you will no longer have dozens if not hundreds of veteran snipers to carry you through the final wave .
i feel as though addressing balance problems with these two units will drastically change the progression of the game .
the numbers of the suggested changes i chose are pulled out of a hat so to speak .
i based them off what i feel would reflect the changes i 'm suggesting .
is this not possible to use the trackpad while having the thumb rest on the left click ?
if there 's a way please tell me thank you !
i ca n't identify the first one the one that looks like a pocket watch with leaves growing out of it .
it did n't seem to have any effect on the game and it did n't show up in my bag .

forgive my ignorance i 'm not familiar with zcash .
i have a friend who was using the zcash4mac wallet some time ago to receive payments from genesis mining .
at some point he uninstalled his wallet before he received his first payout .
he re downloaded it today and his t-address is the same as his payout address on genesis but his wallet balance shows as 0 .
should n't it have the balance if the addresses match ?
could someone please assist/clarify this with me so i can let him know ?

before trading any alt coin always check the volume exchange of the exchange site through coinmarketcap.com .
if the exchange site shows the alt coin price is cheap but it 's volume is low which means the exchange site is shit unreasonable high withdrawal fees long delay withdraws .
in game it lets you go borderless window at 1024x768 or 1280x768 .
looked around alot online ca n't find a way to make it smaller or at very least be able to move the borderless window around .

i forgot to write down the name of this manga but i know it came out somewhat recently .
the scene i remember in particular had the main character with a group against some large creature which he distracts by shooting it in the ass with an arrow .
the second scene i remember which i 'm not sure if it 's from the same manga is that while using a bow the mc used some weird arrow that lopped off the head of some creature while others around him talked about how it would n't work .
any suggestions would help since i do n't remember anything else .
i have n't played any persona games but i 'm a huge fan of rpgs on the ps4 there is a big sale on persona 5 and persona 5 ultimate edition .
do you think the ultimate edition is worth the extra 22 ?
it says it comes with all personas and costumes ?
i do n't want to unlock everything at the start as well i like to earn them through playing the game should i just get the normal edition ?
if ledger was to go out of business would i be able to use my 24 letter backup phrase to recover my wallet ?
also while i was double checking to make sure my 24 letter phrase was correct i noticed that the ledger somehow was able to cut down the amount of time by guessing words after you 've partially typed them in ?
can someone educate me why ledger does not use 12 letter pass phrases or just talk about btc security please .
would n't someone just start guessing random words and eventually just recover other peoples wallets ?
instead of falling into a zipper like formation my teeth on both sides clash due to my upper lateral incisors being too small which has resulted in my other teeth canines premolars molars to shift forward forming a class ii occlusion with little to no overjet .
one thing i should also point out is at the moment it seems as though only the pointy parts of my canines touch when i bite down .
i have small dental abfractions near the gumline on my canines .
i wear my 3 yr old invisalign aligner that serves as a nightguard because i 've noticed that when i do n't wear it my teeth are very sensitive in the morning .
unfortunately the invisalign treatment likely worsened my bite issues because i never noticed this problem before .
is this typically a stable situation that could potentially last a few more years without it being treated or should i get braces asap ?
how is this problem typically fixed extractions braces elastics surgery etc ... ?
so trying to get it to charge ... is the light on the top near the cable supposed to be red and on ?
and the 4 green lights at the bottom are they supposed to be chasing constantly ?
the manual for these things sucks ass and searching online all i can find is a thousand reviews and nothing substantial about how the damn thing actually works .
my dad ca n't send mail using the mac mail client .
using the aol website he can send mail but he is missing a lot of his emails which is also weird .
i 've been on the phone with apple support for 5 hours today and he spent like 8 hours on sunday with both apple and aol .
it was just his mac book air but now it is also not working on his desktop .
so i 'm taking courses down the street from downtown riverside and may have some huge gap times this winter quarter and/or come spring semester .

it could be a spontaneous one-time thing or something we regularly do .

i want to begin designing my own custom linux board as a fun learning experience however i am not sure what chip i should use .
does anyone have a preference for using chips such as the stm32 series or atmel 's sam series ?
is there a good place to start for learning about custom embedded boards ?
i have taken a look at blogs such as this one http hforsten.com/making-embedded-linux-computer.html for help but they do n't seem to go too into detail about connections to ram and io pins
any advice is appreciated as i know this is a very challenging task
a lot of people have been asking about this lately especially on r/nintendoswitch and r/nintendo .
since we got a lot of new players over the holidays i think it 's worth a post .
being able to play via with friends '' is easy and a lot of fun but everyone tends to wonder why ca n't i always be on the same team as my friend ? ''
the reason is that two coordinated players have a big advantage against a group of randoms especially if they 're fairly good players .
it 's easily possible to stack the capabilities of two weapons in an organized fashion for a combination that 's difficult for a randomly assembled to team to deal with .
a few times when explaining this people have said but this other game lets me do that ! ''
turf war is meant to be splatoon 's casual mode .
you can play it as seriously as you want and it 's fun to load up your main weapon and play to win .
but this is also where people to go to get good at new weapons try new strategies test the effectiveness of their gear or just build skill especially if they 're brand new players .
even if you 're fairly good if you end up in a turf war game where coordinated players end up on the same team you will see why it 's been done this way .
but it 's a competitive multiplayer game who cares if people are losing ? ''
they 're out for mass appeal it needs to be as much the shooter for people who play shooters as it is the shooter for people who do n't .
splatoon 3 arms 2 smash for switch and whatever competitive multiplayer game they come up with in the future will all ignore similar conventions if they are offputting to new players or make it too difficult to become a 'real ' player of the game .
nintendo wo n't consider a major game a success unless it has achieved this kind of mass appeal .
why is n't there ranked turf war for teams then ? ''
aside from that though turf war would n't accomplish what it 's supposed to for splatoon 's ecosystem if it were split that way .
a healthy mix of player skill levels and different weapons makes turf beneficial to new players and fun for experienced players .
play turf and enjoy it splat your friend when they 're on the other team and try league mode when you really want some spicy squid .
it amazes me no one at this studio understands the simple concept of marketing .
yes yes we want to show everything off at once .
however even though yes most people do n't like waiting forever you have to advertise a teaser or something so there is some hype each day less and less people are getting interested in this game .
i ca n't believe i 'm saying this but i hope this game screws up horribly gearbox needs to know to something right .
we 've been waiting for 5 years and we all knew how poorly battleborn was gon na go over and i hope they fail as a company for being so ignorant to their fans .
i loved borderlands and borderlands 2 as well as prequel .
i spent hours upon hours on these games and they are still among the top of my favorite games .
it pains me to think how poorly their treating us huge fans .
a simple poster would make me have a huge smile on my face .
unfortunately until then the hype for this game is dead and soon the game itself will be dead .
they would have to show off something quite unbelievable to flip the table around .
i have around 60 hours into a solo game and want to start a co-op one on the side .
i 'm wanting to play a shadowblade possibly playing sebille as one .
that being said i 'm not hard set on that and just want to find someone to play with and we can figure it out from there .
i like to pretty much do all the quests and everything so if you want to get through it quick you might not like playing with me .
not trying to roleplay or anything like that just want someone to casually game with whenever we have the time .
was wondering if anyone had any interest with tefl heaven ?
i 've never really understood postmodernism but i hear a lot of to me it seems mostly university lecturers like jordan peterson mention of it and generally in a bad light
i 've very briefly looked into foucoult having heard his name thrown around but never really understood the movement as a whole .
i 've been researching crypto for a few weeks now and i 'm amazed at how much there is to learn .
i 've never invested in anything before but i am a young guy with 3000 that i would like to put into crypto .
from what i 've researched the coins i 'm looking at are
and i 'm also considering xlm eng and iota .
my original plan was to invest 500 each into the top 6 and see how they do .
what i 'm wondering is would it be smarter to invest less money into each asset and diversify more 10 in each of the nine to maximize chances of choosing a winner or would it be smarter to hold higher percentages in more established currencies 25 btc 25 eth and 12.5 in the other four .
just wondering how others have spread their portfolios and what makes the most sense for someone looking to maximize roi .
initially i will be starting out slow and i plan to just hodl and watch the market until i can learn more about trading .
any advice/opinions on asset choices and allocation would be greatly appreciated .
for those of you not familiar with the story of five animal kung fu it was created by three people jue yuan 18 luohan bai yufeng chi kung and li sou hong quan in the late yuan dynasty around 1300 ad .
supposedly this great martial art that revolutionized shaolin and inspired countless others .
jue yuan and bai yufeng are most likely fictional characters from a story ca n't remember which one .
shaolin hand to hand combat really did n't get traction till the ming dynasty .
during the ming dynasty was when the shaolin monastary became library for different techniques forms i 've heard that they had as many 300 different forms but that is outside coming in .
now with that many forms they would need some kind of classification system like any library .
which the five animals have historically been used for .
li sou the only historically verifiable personage who actually had an actual impact on shaolin xiao hong quan da hong quan existed in the ming dynasty which fits in with what we know about shaolin hand to hand combat historically .
assuming the five animal story is some type of allegorical tale depicting the origins of hand to hand combat styles at shaolin we can surmise that there may have never been a five animal style but rather a classification system of the different forms brought to shaolin perhaps even adding to the later legend of shaolin being great fighters because they had a library of different techniques to learn from and making it the equivalent of mma gym for its time .

i tried sending 15 in btc to binance with a 15 tx fee about thirty minutes ago and have not had any confirmations for the transaction yet .
only two are needed so that the transaction will take place but i have n't even gotten one .
i know btc is backed up like crazy right now but does anyone else have any experience transferring btc from coinbase to binance ?
ripple is the only coin not offered on coinbase that i absolutely love .
ethereum and ripple are my two absolute favorite currencies .
hi all tomorrow the northeast is predicted to be getting quite the snowstorm .
i 've been eyeing snowshoes for a while and think this might be the perfect opportunity to finally pull the trigger .
i should have bought them during the holiday sale with the 25 off coupon code .
if anyone has a coupon they do not plan on using i would greatly appreciate it !
i am going to migrate my 4 disks from ds411 to a ds1817 .
i 've read that migrating is no problem if i follow instructions .
i have 3x4tb disks and 1x3tb disks in raid5 at the moment .
i have one 4tb disk in spare in case the 3tb breaks..
when i migrate to the new ds1817 should i replace the 3tb disk with the 4tb ?
or should i add the 4 tb disk so that i have 4x4tb and 1x3tb .
i am also wondering is it possible and should i migrate from raid5 to shr ?
i have an amazon gift card i want to use before you ask .
so i 've been following this game for awhile i forgot about it and now started keeping track again .
this game looks so much fun and is pretty much everything i 've always wanted in a video game .
the realism the beautiful world and medieval scenery is just heaven to look at !
now my first question is will there be a lot of big battles you fight in or is it going to be like skyrim where you 're in one once in a blue moon .
i 'm a huge fan of total war and m b it would be epic if i could fight whenever on a battleground or be able to replay it .
ok so i know modding is already confirmed for this game but do you guys think consoles will get mod support ?
if this is their first game i doubt it i figured i would ask .
my final question is what is this game like ?
do the enemies get stronger with you as you progress or do they stay the same while it gets easier for you ?
can i continue the main quest and do side quest or do i have to complete the side quest to continue the main story ?
i do n't like getting overwhelmed with side quest i like taking my time playing the game and usually save some for later on in the playthrough .
edit i forgot to also ask will there be companions that follow with you ?
i hate playing games where i feel like a lone soldier .
welcome to another edition of whatever they throw on knr during the evening .
releasing the game for free with no teasers no trailer and no announcement was amazing it was an awesome surprise and i loved it .
also releasing it a day early was really fun felt like old times when scott would release every game early .
but the fnaf games are over now i think it would be for the best if scott communicated his plans directly instead of being vague as he generally has been for the past few years .
this is just my opinion and i 'm not criticizing scott for how he does things .
we 've been just fine with how things have been but i do think this would be better .
right now we have no idea what the future of fnaf is nor do we know what scott is doing or if he plans on continuing to release new video games .
like i said i loved the way fnaf 6 was handled but it was incredibly frustrating not knowing if it was cancelled or not and having no clue where the series was going .
i think developer updates every three or four months or even only twice a year would be great so we have a general idea of what to expect for the future .
right now we know nothing and it has been nearly a month since the release of the last game .
if scott wants to take a long time off from game development that would be cool too but i just wish we were n't in the dark most of the time about what 's to come .
tldr we launching votefornetneutrality.com https votefornetneutrality.com a tool to help you track your lawmaker 's position on net neutrality and let them know that if they do n't vote for the cra to overturn the fcc 's repeal then you wo n't vote for them in the next election .
we at fight for the future https www.fightforthefuture.org are launching votefornetneutrality.com https votefornetneutrality.com to call on internet users across the country to urge their lawmakers to protect net neutrality via the congressional review act cra and let them know that if they do n't vote for the cra to overturn the fcc 's repeal then you wo n't vote for them in the next election .
congress has the power to overturn fcc 's disastrous repeal of net neutrality by using the congressional review act cra .
29 senators have already signed on to support it https www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-2018-if-they-dont-vote-for-net-neutrality-lets_us_5a4d0888e4b0df0de8b06ea5 and now all we need is one more senator to force it to a vote on the floor .
if it passes the senate we 'll need to get several more republicans in the house to support it to force a vote there but with 75 of republican voters in support of net neutrality and a handful of gop lawmakers already coming out against the fcc 's net neutrality repeal it 's looking more and more likely that we can make that happen .
head over to votefornetneutrality.com https votefornetneutrality.com or or text vote to 384-387 and sign the pledge .
we 'll reach out to your representative and let them know that unless they vote for the cra to overturn the fcc net neutrality vote you will not vote for them come midterm elections .
you 'll also receive a text on election day letting you know whether your lawmakers voted in favor of the cra .
so join us and let congress know that come election day if they did n't votefornetneutrality you will .

i had wonderful logitech speakers that died after over 10 years of service and listening to music from my laptop is pish in comparison .
now that there are more portable options on the market i was looking into getting a ue megaboom which seems to market for around 140£ on amazon uk and nearer 200€ on irish retailer sites .
that said i am seeing a lot of reviews where it seems to die after 3 months .
i am looking for something a bit more longterm than that !
do any of you have any recommendations for similar quality but more reliable for a similar or lower price bracket ?
i wanted to start off by saying how much i love this sub and how therapeutic it has been not to feel alone in being exjw .
i 'm also grateful for the incredible insight that people on here are sharing .
i 'm assuming i cant be the only queer person out of 17,293 .
the point of this post though is to ask if any lgbt people could share their experience inside and after leaving the borg .
maybe also how you have adjusted to the real world and where you are now in terms of personal development .
my story is pretty standard for being queer pansexual and born in with mostly jw family .
when i was pimi i thought i could marry into the org and after armageddon would be cured of any deviant thoughts .
im so happy now that i did not go down this path .
as i progressed into my 20s i began to see the cracks in doctrine and the cognitive dissonance was starting to get to me and i started to slowly break away from my indoctrination .
i was about 25 when i got cruised by a gentleman in his 50s who was just my type .
we hooked up in the gym sauna and subsequently started meeting up pretty regularly .
turns out this guy was married with kids and was living a lie like i was .
i did n't want to turn out like him a few years down the line .
this is what got me on the road to being pomo .
it was tough telling my family that i did n't believe in their religion anymore and that i was moving to another city .
it 's been 4 years since all this and its been a real trip adjusting to real life instead of a manufactured fantasy .
i went through a bit of a nympho phase right after breaking away from the org with orgies and hooking up with 5 people a day but now i 'm in a monogamous relationship with a lovely man who gets me .
it 's been tough learning to love who i am while adjusting living in the real world and rebuilding my life from scratch but i have not regretted leaving even once .
hey guys hope you are n't sick of seeing my name in the sub yet .
i have a working paper wallet generator that writes a printable pdf with qr logo etc .
i have learned just an absolute assload of javascript in the past few days so these projects will eventually increase in quality as well .
happy to answer any questions take any criticism except the logo took hours to make it look as passable as it does .

ok so i have one amazon echo in our bedroom upstairs which controls the lights with 'alexa turn the lights on ' or 'alexa turn the lights blue ' etc
i recently picked up another echo for downstairs in our office and some more philips hue bulbs and a hub .
the new echo can only turn the lights on if i say 'alexa turn the office lights on ' and off with the off command though it cant change the colour of the lights .
im also wanting to just say 'alexa lights on ' and make the office lights go on without it triggering the ones upstairs .
i have made smart groups for upstairs and downstairs bedroom is still working perfectly but office isnt .
only thing i have noticed differently is that i have an option in the smart bedroom group where the bulbs are called lights '' which is all of the lights which is my original bulbs .
though i do not have that lights for the new hub .
sorry if this all seems confusing but if anyone manages to get to the end of this and has any ideas how to change the lights colours or make the office room respond to alexa lights on '' instead of office lights on '' please let me know
i would really like to get some thoughts on it and any type of critism is welcome .

like many many many people who literally lost millions of dollars on november 7th during the flash crashes i have been trying to contact bitfinex to have them look into my account and explain why i my position did not liquidate like it should have long before the flash crash and only liquidated after the flash crash at a value over 15 below market value .
over a month down the line i have still not received a meaningful reply to my support requests .
i even received a message saying that bitfinex notice i had a support request open and wanted to know if i still needed a reply .
i would really like to know why you liquidated my account in the way that you did .
heck a nice explanation of why there are flash crashes on your platform when there were not flash crashes on other platforms would also be really nice .
while i am at it maybe an explanation as to why nobody could access their accounts during the flash crashes would be great too .
like i love to cuddle with my cats which i recently adopted a few months ago 8m 8m and 3m .

every time they do it i gently move their claws off of me and say no owies '' but i do n't think they 're getting it .
is there a way to train them to stop this behavior especially since they 're big kitties now or do i just need to invest in some kevlar ?

the first time yan zhaoge crossed worlds he landed in a martial warrior civilization that was at the peak of prosperity .
he ended up in the book storage building of the the divine palace which collected and preserved the classics of the entire world from all fields of knowledge .

yan zhaoge 's soul once again crossed over but this time he arrived in the same world except countless years have passed .
with his brain full of rare books and classics from the era of peak prosperity yan zhaoge 's second crossing over to the present era was like a gamer who was used to playing hell mode suddenly finding himself playing the game on easy .

was that because the military was unfairly biased in their favor ?

pointless because you can prove actual trial court rulings ?

if he does n't have insurance i would suggest he talk to social services and apply for medical aid .
that will either get him meds for free or at a very low co-pay .
a lot of people have a negative view about public assistance but these programs exist for reasons just like this one .
while he 's at social services he can try to speak with a social worker .
it 's absolutely amazing how many residences l resources a good social worker knows to help people .
everything from food to housing to clothes and employment .
sadly at this point if his parents are not willing to help he needs to start putting everything in his own name .

do n't let mr gain make you lose focus of the important thing which is having fun .

try the karak or soma which are similar weapons the soma is quite powerful .
some frames work better in certain mission types than others .
best used in defense or survival missions where you can stay close to your team and keep replenishing their health and energy .
it is less useful in stuff like capture or assassination missions where your entire team is just flying through the level to only kill one target .
it 'll be a little easier to level some frames in certain mission types .
the standard etiquette for leveling although i should stress this is not a rule is to try and avoid taking both leveling frames and weapons into a mission .
if you are leveling a frame try and take a powerful weapon so that you can still help your team kill stuff .
if you are leveling a weapon take a good frame and possibly another fully leveled weapon as well .
the idea is to always try and contribute to the mission while leveling your gear .
there is nothing to stop you from leveling a frame and three weapons at the same time if you choose to but you might annoy your team mates a bit if you take a weak frame and weapons to a higher level mission .
plus it is beneficial to level one item at a time because of the way xp is divided between your frames and weapons .
most frames are quite good but you will find that you like some more than others .
likewise some weapons are objectively more powerful than others but you should eventually try as many as you can to see what you like and what you do n't .
it 's possible you find a gun that is n't the best for damage but you enjoy using it and there 's nothing wrong with that .
just keep playing and in time you will find frames/weapons that you like .
the mk1 weapons are quite weak and wo n't help you much with higher level content .
they are what is called 'mr fodder ' which you level and discard sell immediately .
so for example if you want to level the mk1-bo use a level 30 rhino and a level 30 hek shotgun and keep your mk1-bo equipped in the melee slot .
do missions normally and kill stuff with your primary weapon and you will passively level your melee .
completing the solar map is an important medium to long term goal .
it opens up all the mission nodes for you to do alerts/void fissures/invasions later and completing every node once contributes xp towards your mastery rank .
there are obviously other things to do as well in the game plains junctions fissures etc .
so you can maintain some variety in what you do while still working towards completing the solar map .
sometimes you will have trouble with certain bosses or missions using leveling gear .
there 's nothing wrong in taking your best gear in to complete it .
rhino in particular is a really powerful frame and will be good enough to clear the entire solar map .
upgrade your mods check online to see good builds and if possible consider installing an orokin reactor on the frame .
doubling the mod capacity makes a huge difference and will help you a lot in surviving harder missions .

not trying to be a dick but have you ever lost a game while being the best in the lobby by far ?

you never ever go after an infect creature before combat damage unless your hand is forced .
on your own main phase is the best but barring that go for their endstep .
there are many scenarios where you might want to wait .
scenario 1 you have a bolt in hand and you think they have a pump spell .
if you try to kill it precombat they pump in response and you take a bunch of infect .
if you do n't they either pump for damage and you kill it in response or they do n't and you can make them burn the pump spell to protect the inkmoth .
scenario 2 you have a bolt they 're crimped on green with lots of cards in hand .
if you try it main phase they pump untap attack and pump .
if you try it in combat you get blown out .
if you wait they either pump and you kill it in response or they hold up the pump for protection and get in for less poison .

i have the feeling that some people think that coins are like shares and that an increase in the success of the blockchain will mean more demand for the coin but i am not convinced that this is the case .
i hope it is the case for the coins i am holding .
i 'm pretty new to the space so possibly just ignorant .
in trying to understand i rarely see analysis go all the way to proving that adoption of the given blockchain solution will result in coin demand .
i also see people assuming that it 's a good thing if the company launching the coin is getting contracts but i do n't see any discussion on how the company is getting paid for those contracts .
waltonchain is getting contracts but what if lots of contracts results in waltonchain 's main revenue stream being payment for installing the system and training people to use it etc .
does n't that mean they will have increasingly less vested interest in the coin value being high ?

thousands of years of advancements in technology agriculture social morals and the ladder of social hierachy allowed us to become a somewhat advanced species with knowledge of the stars our home planet and beyond .
this game is the physical and digital embodiment of the blood sweat and tears along with the pain and suffering all of humanity has endured from the beggining .
the flawless graphics eye candy to even the harshest game critic or digital art connoisseur .
splendid colours and the cleanest possible gameplay allow for a almost orgasmic experience everytime this game is booted up on any device .
badrats as almost a poetic metaphor symbolises the struggle of the lower/middle class citezens finally rising up against their wealthier more powerful counterparts in society beautifully demonstrating without error the divide between the rich and poor in todays society .
such class and perfection with its execution of higher thinking in this game is only rivalled by the finest literature the brothers karamazov .
i would even go as far to say that this game was based on the inspiring philosophical novel .
the level of intellect required to play this game is almost non existent in todays society as you sheep fail to see the deeper meaning in this games flawless stature and gameplay .
its almost a shame really that such a advanced back story and morality portrayed by the stunning characters goes un-noticed by the close eyed sheep who fail to read between the lines of this masterpiece .
simlilarly the only thing that compares to this game in this modern time of bias media and sheep is the long lost disney special titled gross little boys from north korea '' not to be confused with gross little girls from north dakota '' both of which star chris christie in this timeless classic about children discovering the world for the first time .
i have devoted my time to create a cinematic on youtube further explaining the concept of this revolutionary title for the thots that fail to even grasp the meaning of bad rats .

remove sasuke retrieval arc from naruto and what do you have ?
naruto and sakura 's entire motivation in shippuden is focused on getting sasuke back .
his pursuit of itachi is a major story arc of shippuden and the largest plot twist in the series .
he forces orochimaru to revive the hokage which majorly affects the war especially with minato in particular
he is partly responsible for defeating kabuto ending the edo tensei
the plot would hardly be affected if sasuke did n't exist .
this is just a laughably false statement idk what to even say

i found out about them in late 2014 and my intense stage kicked in around february 2015 and lasted 9 months .
my best friend is a huge bts fan too and we would binge watch their shows together .
i remember obsessively watching the bangtan bombs ahl episodes rookie king and listening to all their songs during my spring break which was right before my college entrance exams yikes lol .
i went to one of their mini-concerts/fan meets in november 2015 and i met them in person .
i was definitely not mentally prepared though i sort of blacked out and do n't remember most of the details .
i chilled out after those 9 months and became more of a casual fan .
i still really love bts and feel like a proud mom every time they achieve something new i just do n't have as much time to dedicate to watching their interviews .
plus they 're getting so much media attention internationally and are constantly appearing in new interviews and shows it 's difficult to keep up lol .
it 's really awesome that they 're becoming more and more popular worldwide and their talent is being recognized but sometimes i feel nostalgic for the old days .
all their interviews and even their vlive run episodes are all professionally done plus they 've matured a lot .
i sometimes miss the days when it was just 7 dorks fooling around with a camera .

the best thing to say is that barring injuries mlb is not a position we need to worry about for the next 3-4 years and that 's actually more of a compliment than it may sound like .
hindsight being 20/20 we probably should have gone after a big get at lb in fa and then drafted a de with the 1st round pick .
you could say those were n't the best options on the board '' at the time and maybe so but davis 's under-performance at least makes this an honest debate .
both lb and de were emergency-level needs and we chose davis to address one and largely ignored the other .
davis helped stopped the garbage fire among the lb unit and allowed whitehead to play his more natural role but as we saw after the first couple of weeks of the season he was not quite nfl-ready in pass protection and some other aspects of the game and the total absence of a pass rush from the dl hurt the overall defense much more than whatever davis added to it .
i 'm fully confident he 'll be ready by the beginning of next season but also do n't yet see evidence of historical greatness that a lot of people were bestowing on him the ridiculous the fact that he sucks now is proof that he will be great in the future '' people .

i felt like it was one of the most underrated albums in recent memory
the third godfadder movie hinted at the power wielded by the mob .
especialy in italy after ww2 the provincial us government appointed mafia guys to run sicily since the mob guys helped during the war .
anyway from that perspective the 3rd movie was engaging but godfadder 2 was the best movie in the trilogy for me only for the post-ellis island immigrant community segments and how it was depicted .
ironically deniro who 's mostly jewish nailed the part deserved to win the best supporting actor .
i do n't see any flaws in this movie .
it has the rare combinaton of being highly entertaining with production excellence .
like a david lean movie such as zhivago or lawrence .

oh the submission of homework is n't the issue .
i used to come from a school where some students have this issue but not where i am currently working .
this is more a case of the student being unable to produce quality work .
which is n't entirely their fault i can not expect most 17 year olds to produce quality equivalent to essentially first class honours in university .
and i know how out of depth both the parents and students are because as i said i personally ca n't teach any subject outside of my immediate subject area and even crafting the lessons in my area requires hours of referencing university texts .
it is one of the downsides to our rigidly meritocratic and highly competitive system .
the stakes are high and there are no second chances .
if you do badly at the national exams there is no retaking it .
i guess the crux of my issue is there are ways for me to motivate an intelligent or capable but lazy student or at last i 'm still learning to .
how do you help the kid who averages a 30 despite studying till midnight every day and submitting all his work on time ?
the answer to that question will change your options dramatically .
i 'm a female and i 'd say that you 're actually quite handsome .
these ideas all sound really nice especially if you enjoy them .
you could like you said it would be fairly expensive but you could get one of those adapters that allows you to draw directly into an art program then animate your drawings .

in morrowind 3e 427 it had 1 28-day month 4 30-day months and if we omit and ignore the accidental omitting of the month morning star 7 31-day months .
in oblivion 3e 433 4e 0 and skyrim 4e 201/4e 202 it had 1 28-day month 4 30-day months and 7 31-day months 365 the main different about this calendar is that frostfall has 31 days as opposed to morrowind 's 30 and sun 's dawn had 30 as opposed to morrowinds ' 31
for arena and daggerfall i predict that after the warp of the west the imperial calendar undertook a reformation and changed to the one we see in oblivion .
for the case of morrowind 's calendar maybe it was maintained due to morrowind 's greater autonomy as a province ?

there 's 2 things in life that are certain .
i think it would be interesting to learn about different countries ' stance on taxes regarding crypto gains and losses .
as far as i know here in denmark they are still figuring out how to deal with it .
there are a few lucky ones who bought a lot of btc before 2014 so they are basically set for life except ... they are too scared to withdraw because they are not entirely sure how big of a cut tax daddy is gon na lay claim to .
1. if you purchase crypto with the intent to use as a method of payment any gains or losses have no tax relevance .
2. if you purchase crypto with the intent to speculate make a profit you 'll pay 53 on gains and may deduct 28 on losses .
how is the tax situation regarding crypto where you live ?
for me its leave it all behind by cult to follow.

ok we 've see bitcoin cash fork followed by bitcoin gold and diamond .
this time zclassic is joint-forking with bitcoin into bitcoin private .
my first instinct is that the devs are pumping zclassic into bitcoin gold levels so that they can dump their bags .
this is by far the most insane fork i have ever seen .
2 forks joining into a new forked coin is like some 2 girlrs one cup level of forking .
when 2 people like each other they come together in a relationship .
but does it mean they 'have ' to commit to marriage ?
i have a ba in middle east studies and am currently learning to be a skilled sound 'guy ' for feature films .

i should be able to work as a boom operator post production sound mixer or sound designer .

hey i 'm a 19 year old biochem major and i 'm just looking for someone in roughly the same age range to talk with .

i listen to just about everything but screamo and classic rock which many people have told me is a mistake to skip out on rock i mean .
everything from j cole halsey fall out boy to daniel caesar and recently brockhampton i 'm kind of all over the place .
and no i am not ashamed of how much i love pop music though i feel like sometimes it does go to embarrassing lengths .
i would love to maybe exchange playlists or song recommendations .
on the movie front i 'm trying to get more into film and some of my favourites are her la la land and ex machina .
i 'm sorta one of those people who has a million ideas of what they want to do writing music screenwriting drawing going to med school doing graduate research etc and never enough time to figure out what i want to do first .
aside from the pop culture side of things i really love learning about anything really .
i 'm terrible at trivia so i 'm always interested .
besides other basic interests i 'm really just looking to write someone a couple times a month or more depending on how crazy school gets i 'd love to hear about where you come from and what your life is like !
i do n't think i 've been exposed to nearly as much of the world as i would like to be so we could really talk about whatever and maybe become friends !
this is getting kinda lengthy so i think i should call it let me know if your interested and i 'll try to get back to ya !

is there some sort of newbie guide where i can find the answers to these questions ?
has anyone been to college counselling for a non-academic/non-emergency issue ?

i will not be saying my channel name unless someone asks me .
i streamed some arizona sunshine last night with a couple of mates and it was absolutely hilarious .
i 've watched the vod and even watching it back was a great laugh .
the only issue i see with vr is that it is seen as a solo experience and it will always struggle unless the reach is high enough .
well i think we proved that albeit some minor mishaps with getting into a lobby with them it can be a great laugh and even when not experienced can still be fun to watch .
what 's the best way anyone has had to get some reach ?
our stream maxed out at 6 people yesterday ... ideally i 'd like 10 to start with .
i want to do a charity stream at some point in 2018 so obviously the more viewers the better .
also my mates were using the rift so it shows the cross-platform working nicely .

the site does n't allow me to download any albums without signing or donating anymore ...
i would n't say i 'm a freeloader but the deletion of albums that are n't from the newest comiket bothers me .
there are so many circles that have incomplete discographies and barring users from posting albums is idiotic .
it was one of the only websites that had a functional search option .
if so who do you use or who do you recommend ?
i am new to all of this broker stuff and am currently searching for one that is compatible for mt4 and allows usa and ea 's if thats at all possible or available out there without to high of a spread..

a reminder to never ever input your private keys on any bogus website to double check website urls entered .
1 get a ledger nano s or trezor asap they work well with many wallets and sites like mew and it takes less than 5 minutes to learn how to use one !
here 's a good tutorial on using ledger with myetherwallet .
note it is impossible for your wallets to be hacked when using a ledger .
when you buy this unit it gives you 24 seed words you write down on a piece of paper these keywords should never touch your computer .
if you ever lose your ledger you can buy a new one and restore all your wallets from these 24 seed words .
the ledger protects you by never revealing your private keys .
if your pc is infected your wallets would still be fine .
3 if you use google authenticator make sure you write down your keys not having this information means you will be locked out if you lose your phone or it gets broken .
a better alternative is authy however make sure devices allow multi-device is switched off .

woah this sub was made like 4 hours ago and yet here i am to spill my guts .
he was in very bad health for a long time prior to his passing .
he was a great father and a very smart man but always on the conservative/right-wing side of things .
he fancied himself an entrepreneur and even emigrated from canada to the us to start his own business because he thought his home country was too socialist .
during his last years alive he was unemployed defeated and had nothing else to do besides obsessively watch fox news while chain smoking and binge drinking .
when i came over we 'd watch old movies or sports or something because he respected my disdain for the channel .
it 's hard to remember what 2014 was like but it was still relatively calm compared to what began happening in 2015-2016 .
there were few to zero scandals and every criticism of obama was a far reach but nonetheless he took that bait .
it was certainly sad and strange to hear him voice his opinion about the poor the immigrants the unemployed etc .
because ... he was a poor unemployed albeit legal immigrant .
this made me terribly sad because i dared not point out to him that he was that which he despised .
it was just too weird to say out loud .
regardless he 'd still spout off about it for some reason .
even stranger still was the fact that he had moved back to canada due to the fact that he had no healthcare here and desperately needed to take care of his declining health .
he was being treated in a universal healthcare system yet would still berate the aca and the mere idea of universal healthcare .
in a way i feel blessed that he passed prior to the 2016 election cycle .
i am the first to admit that it 's fucking dark to think this .
who would n't want more time on earth with their beloved father .
but if he were to witness the chaos that ensued i am quite certain he would have wound up a braindead maga boomer and it would have destroyed our otherwise very treasured bond .
i 'm saying this knowing he was an erudite george-will-reading charlie-rose-watching ken-burns-enjoying smarty-pantsier-than-thou conservative guy .
you know as much as a dude his age could be .
his kind of conservatism was not trumpism but i still ... know ... deep in my heart that he would have been converted .
he was in such a bad place that make america great again '' would truly embolden him .
it would allow him to place all the blame for his poor decisions on external sources .
i could accept him voting for bush mccain and romney .
maybe just because i was too young to care back then ...
but if he had been alive to support trump it would have killed me .
so i am glad he died on dec. 20 2014 and not in 2015 2016 2017 or 2018 .
i am glad i have nothing but good memories of my stuffy yet lovable old fashioned dad .
even though i have vivid daydreams of things he probably would say about what 's going on i still think of him as a generic conservative and not a trump-zombie .
i hope to provide support to others who are dealing with actual living relatives due to this political climate ... 3
i would love to post here again about my in-laws and i will be far less forgiving .
here 's a preview of what my in-laws are like
picture me my so mil and fil at dinner at a shitty steakhouse in florida .
it began with the oh-so-innocent statement from mil ... i 'm not racist at all you know who i would vote for ?
i then told them that condoleezza rice was a lesbian .
she 's not out but it 's widely assumed due to the fact that she has never married a man and conveniently co-owns and lives in a house with another woman in the san francisco bay area .
keep in mind female me my male so have been together for 10 years but have never married .
because we simply do n't give a shit about it .
it just is such a wild reach and so very purposely hurtful .
i tried to launch discord to talk to friends and when i tried it said that the file had moved could not be found .
when i tried to reinstall it said that there a was installation failure .
i have always been a player that lands in isolated areas .
used to land and loot with ease and almost 0 encounters .
now even the smallest hut in the outskirts has someone there .
are you city landers seeing less competition as more are realizing there is good loot in the outskirts as well ?
before i went and rented a server i was curious .
does the rental fee include the game on the server or do i also need to buy another copy of the game/dlcs ?

anyone else see this or have any info on it ?
i 've had eight puppies born in game so far and all of them have been male .
is my game bugged or is this just a coincidence ?
i will preface this post by saying that i am by no means an expert in vlogging i am not a vlogger nor have i ever been .
what qualifies me to provide this feedback/elicit this discussion is the fact that i consume youtube content and i have followed along with many posts and threads throughout this community .
i have observed quite a number of people throughout this community asking how they can grow their channel and garner views for their vlog most asking for feedback surrounding their videos .
most of these vlogs there are some exceptions tend to fall into the same issues allow me to provide you with what i believe may be all round helpful advice
vlogging for the sake of vlogging is not entertaining if all you are doing is recording yourself to put a video out stop .
people want to be entertained they want to watch your video because there is a point to it .
if i am taking the time out of my day to watch you essentially do nothing on camera for 5 10 or 15 minutes then i am assigning some value to your content if at the end of it i feel like it was wasted then the chances are i wo n't watch again .
know your audience the vloggers that succeed on youtube are the ones that know the audience they are catering to .
if the vlogger is rich they are appealing to those who aspire to be like them if they are recording themselves losing weight then they are appealing to those who are also trying to do the same if they are an aspiring actor vlogger that is recording themselves rehearsing or getting into a role then it will appeal to those that are in a similar situation .
if all you are doing is recording your day and your life then essentially you are chronicling your life for posterity you have automatically limited your audience you may think yeah but roman atwood does it ...
he also has a powerful message of positivity littered throughout his videos .
equipment does n't equal better vlogs a lot of you focus on this aspect in your weaknesses let me be as straight forward as i can the quality of your video does n't automatically equate to better content sure it will look better but if it does n't entertain then what is the point .
so long as i can see and hear you then that is all that matters .
if you are not into it then neither are we this is very close to point 1 but some of you seem to feel like it is a chore to record and then edit .
if this is you then maybe vlogging is n't for you someone had to say it .
if you have a point to get across get to it !
pretty self explanatory but so many seem to dwell on a single point and reiterate it time and time again in a video .
f perfection when i watch a vlogger i am not looking for someone who is a casey neistat imitator if your editing is n't perfect that 's okay if you are awkward in front of a camera that is okay .
so long as you can get the point of your video across and i feel i can identify with you then that is all that matters you will get better .
rehearse if you need to if you are not the most confident in front of a camera that is cool i 'm not either but if you need to record the same part a few times or rehearse or dot point what you wan na say then take the time to do it the output will be much better and you will have more content to play with when it comes time to edit .
remember why you are doing it if you are vlogging for you then most of these points do n't apply but if you are vlogging to make a dream a reality of being a full time youtuber then try to take this on board .
this is pretty much what i wanted to say however if there is something i missed out perhaps we can have a helpful guide for future vloggers .
i look forward to a lively discussion and i look forward to your future vlogs .
seems like a plot ploy really because coming back at full power would just be a repeat of last seasons finale .
it does seem weird that he is so weak from losing a little grace .
not even able to defend himself from a knight of hell .
so i 'm just trying to make a very simple workflow .
i often have a whole bunch of similar text i have to write over and over again so i decided to create a workflow to just write it once .
2 copy to clipboard local only unchecked what does this even do ... expire at current date
so i run it and it works on my ipad and the text is in my clipboard and i can paste it now .
but the strange thing is it simply wo n't appear in my clipboard on my iphone .
after running the workflow on iphone i ca n't paste it anywhere it appears as blanks .
when i play back music from the memory it 's fine but the phone alarm clock sound skips horribly when i wakes me up in the morning the timer sound also skips the ringtone skips and it seems to happen when watching youtube on the phone even tho it 's buffed a fair bit over the play progress mark .
really strange because as i say music playback through the phone speakers is fine .
this was n't happening for the first few weeks of having the phone and it seems to of started happening recently .
i am looking for an illustrator to replace an artist on a current job .
the previous artist had been working on a portrait project with me but has recently gone mia .
hopefully this is not too much of a faux pas as i am completely out of options and figuratively up shit creek .
i can pm examples of completed portraits and reference shots for the new portraits .
i need three completed portraits with the potential for work in the future .
any suggestions on food you can tapao to a family gathering during cny ?
there will be older folks so some local food would be great .
if you read my post yesterday i stated that i would miss the morning session .
i missed the first 3 hours of trading because sometimes even life gets in the way of trading .
tomorrow and friday will be full trading days like normal .
i had a difficult time today getting in any type of rhythm .
at times it was like no matter what i did a stock would n't move for me .
sometimes everything works and then the next day you ca n't get the ball rolling .
quite a few asked for entries and exits so i am going to do that the best i can with my best trades .
i will try to offer some explanation as to why i bought and why i sold .
i bought znga around the 4 dollar area earlier in the day and it did n't react like i wanted and sold for a very minor profit .
this was purely based off of reading the tape also known as time and sales .
as i watched buyers pour into the stock there were virtually no sellers .
the more i watched the more i thought the momentum was to the upside at the time .
i bought in and waited for them to take the stock up .
it only up ticked a penny and sat there .
there still were no sellers so i remained in the stock .
as you can see i bought 10k shares total of the stock so just a 2 cent move is worth 200 dollars .
when i sold it was also from reading the time and sales of the stock and noticed once the stock reached a 4.07 bid a lot of selling began .
i was able to sell one of my 5000 share orders at 4.07 but the second i was unable to place the order in time and therefore was filled with a 4.06 bid .
i referred yesterday to someone about price improvement dark pools and order flow .
as you look you can see where the price was when i bought 4.05 .
when i bought and was filled they gave me 4.044 .
that is a price improvement of .6 of a cent or 30 dollars when buying 5000 shares .
so now when the stock went up a penny instead of being up 100 dollars i was actually up 160 dollars .
as you can also see on my sales instead of getting filled on the exact price of the bid they gave me price improvement on my sales .
these types of orders add up all day long .
these are dark pools who pay for retail order flow .
it is true they are trading against me but as you can see they do n't always win .
this trade was a momentum trade at a round number .
it had a lot of volume today which i call expanding volume '' .
if you look at the daily chart the volume for the day is much higher than previous days .
as a day trader it is important to notice things like this intraday .
i missed most of the day but traded this at the round number of 19 for a scalp .
this trade is much more typical of my trading style .
as you can see i took a quick scalp and was only in the trade for 5 seconds .
i do n't really have a bad trade to post that i could teach anything .
i tried buying intc off of some news after it had sold off and sold it for a 23 dollar loss .
that was actually my worst loss of the day .
i thought perhaps the news would pop the stock and it did n't work .
finally i posted the times of the above trades so anyone that has the ability to replay the markets can go back and watch the time and sales as i traded .
i just found a page that has every variant even has the pictures ...
wonder why a lot of them do n't show in the game ?
i am guessing maybe they will be in collections sometime ?
whats the point of surviving the night state '' if in the next one you will die for sure ?
i believe the remaining survivor should be able to kill the horrors in their human form or infected w/e you call 'em if he manages to down them .
for these sorts of issues is usually pointless unless you 're asking a room full of people on the same isp or in the same neightborhood since this is almost always an issue that is local and specific to you your network and the way your isp routes traffic to the server .
if so try to get to a wired connection and see if the problem goes away .
have any new devices or software been added to the network/pc around the time the problem began ?
if so disable them and see if the problem goes away .
open the network overlay in game ctrl+shft+n and check which server you 're connecting to .
if it 's different from normal there may be a traffic routing issues that 's beyond your control .
if it 's not record the ip address of the server for the next thing
run a timeless ping test to the server or at least battle.net and see what your connection looks like over time .
if you see consistently high ping times or lots of dropped packets contact your isp for further troubleshooting .
if none of that has any effect see blizzard support .
adding to this i 'm not aware of any internal service issues being reported .
u/toky18 let us know if the latency is n't improved after reviewing the steps we offer here https battle.net/support/article/30274 ? utm_source=external-reddit utm_medium=posting utm_campaign=blizzardcs utm_content=solution .

it 's an appeal to ridicule rather than an actual answer to the man 's argument .
yeah i agree the guy just made it sound like they are all inherently great presidents .
the conversation between luke and chewie was likely focused on han .
rey likely would n't be mentioned at least not by name .
i dont think that would create a transaction though right ?
i wonder if we could ever get some names of the people responsible for fucking dave chappelle like a bitch .
what 's iceberg slim 's real name as it were ?
and here i actually thought some clever bastard was baking cookies in some extreme hot weather .
but than are n't you killing someone who has reaffirmed thier love of god and is n't that just as wrong as killing the unborn fetus ?
i searched alanon there 's nothing within about 2.5 hours of me .
do n't try to do it all on your own figure out where you can cut corners w/r/t time or expense that wo n't be noticeable and do n't plan something outside your budget .
nothing makes you become resentful more than feeling overextended mentally and financially .
only issue is that it 'll be a long distance if it does work out
particularly on the surface to my experience the red zone likes to give out ye olde metal building parts moreso .
the main one i 've noticed that seems improved in any way is that swords and pump shotguns pop up in abberations drops .
scorched had better drops and an emphasis on its own equipment .
abberation seems a lot more copy-pasted like either they forgot to do the loot tables like they forgot about kibble or they were worried about pay to win accusations if the dlc had better drops lol .
i 'm high af and i have no idea what this post means
amazon alexa ghost now only speaks in tess everis ' voice and can only use voice activated commands to make purchases from eververse .
over in the breitbart comments section there are at least some siding with bannon over trump .
it 's not a majority but it 's yet another segment trump risks losing when he ca n't afford to lose anything .
and even some of trump 's defenders seem uncomfortable with him using the white house 's bully pulpit to tend to the president 's fragile ego and walk all over a long time ally .
this is n't him telling it like it is '' this is him projecting intense weakness .
there 's only so much trump can praise people then do a complete 180 and talk about them like they 're utter garbage after they said something that hurt his feelings before people start to finally realize that nothing he says is worth anything .
at the same time some of the people taking trump 's side are vowing to never read breitbart again which diminishes the noxious influence of the site .
so it 's like a psycho pass choose your own adventure that i play on my ps4 ?

this is the first gran turismo game i have skipped and i have been playing the series since 1997 .
i still ca n't believe this entire shift in focus and content .
bsp is running two sequences controlling drums and microbrute clock out into varigate 4 and rcd
snare from taiko kick from peaks bass line from castle hats and other boops from pico drums and braids arp from minilogue
snare triggers from bsp are going into branches and then into taiko trigger in taiko acc trigger from div 4 output from rcd with rcd set to 16 max rhythm is in 5 so this leads to some nice variations in snare hits
taiko release modulated by maths with sparse and randomized triggers from rcd through branches this in concert with the randomized triggers gives a really nice variation in snares and livens up the drums a bit
taiko output into e440 with freq modulated via pip slope env triggered by branches opposite the release triggers
ura modulating timbre of braids and freq of castle osc b a very slight detune
hats from pico going into disting in c-3 clock pulses from ura r-pulse out clocking the delay for random/glitchy effects r-pulse density cv 'd from varigate 4
you can probably glean the rest of the patch from the image but if i missed any details of interest just let me know .
i wo n't respond point by point as it 's getting long .
the influence of ideas might just reduce as a function of material influence or a weak coupling term if that line of thought appeals to you .
when biological evolution was discovered that changed people 's thinking because it was a new idea .
how that is interpreted and applied is modulated by people 's physical circumstances yes but i would be very wary of having a lop-sided view where the 'material ' one way or the other is the real source of change and ideas themselves .
similarly we have to look at the real world and how it changes over time if we 're talking about how it might change in the next decades .
yes but marx went further than that and proposed as 'science ' a tenative linear model of social progress culminating in the claim that socialism was inevitable .
by all means figure out what makes society tick .
on the tendency of the rate of profit to fall this has pretty much been roundly debunked .
i think you mean to say ethical acts are n't necessarily religious acts but i think a movement founded on a fixed set of ethics is very similar to a religion .
is a movement say marxism or anarchism founded on a fixed set of political ideas since if a movement was n't fixed by its ideas it would have no distinct existence a religion ?
this idea that ethics and rationality are opposed is incorrect .
the idea that ethics are purely 'personal ' is a very postmodern 'all truths are equal ' view which you probably disagree with strongly otherwise .
the thing is that people 's ethics need to change in order for revolution to happen .
it 's literally and i really mean this impossible to have communism without that ethical shift in people .
and it 's certainly not how other socioeconomic revolutions happened in history .
not sure what revolutions you 're thinking of but revolutions are always ethical .
justice freedom the right of the people to rule themselves etc .
i 'm not saying marx/marxism is all bullshit by the way i do n't think so .
but the super crude 'materialist ' viewpoint commonly associated with it and marx 's teleological view of social change are in my opinion the parts to cast aside .
i have to deal with this all the time .
why order one test when it is cheaper and less blood draws for the patient with a panel ?
i do understand it for babies with their limited amount of blood you can draw .
the chemistry analyzer beckman i work with only does per analyte but i do understand what you 're saying .
fyi if anyone is a patient do not fear questioning your doctor 's lab orders !
it might be the difference between a few dollars to hundreds of dollars .
i digress but my favorite frequently ordered combination are qualitative beta hcgs and quants .
you realize you 're responding to a months old post right ?
also do n't tell me what to do i live in illinois so i know more about chicago then you do dumbass .

for those who do n't know it 's so bad that cards fresh from packs can have a slight but noticeable curve to them .
we are in spoiler season for new cards right now and someone got their hands on a pack right before any cards were announced and posted some camera shots of 3 cards .
we all accepted the cards as real partly because the cards were already curling .
ah that 's what i get for not reading the post carefully .
our president is kind of a piece of shit as a person .
i stabbed someone one time and set out an s-mine and the s-mine had blood on it !

well we got the investors that came in later at between .01-.03 and havent seen gains yet so they panic and sell off .

yeah not everyone was complicit but to take swastikas etc .
seriously and censor them for non-educational purposes is not a bad idea .
swasticas are also a religious symbol of hinduism should that be illegal ?
what happens when someone makes anothere symbol for representing nazism ?
maybe i should go to germany and wear an iron cross that 's fine but no the swastica is the evil one ...
you guys are not as powerful as you think .
what with your widdle tiki torches and your white polo shirts .
you 're not even a serious movement for god sakes .
all those unite the right rallies were dwarfed by mobs of people reminding you what a joke the alt right is '' .
i mean every time i saw you guys it was the lamest smattering of idiots each chasing different agendas i 've ever seen !
i guess it 's hard to get your messaging on point when you 're crying about how your unmotivated uneducated asses ca n't find a job because of all them minorities taking your opportunities !
man it 's never been harder to be white amirite ?
either minorities are taking your jobs or no one wants to hire a fucking nazi with caustic personalities that are incompatible with society .
after the sickening violence your side committed in charlottesville you were met with mob that dwarfed that pathetic gathering in boston .
you guys are so awful that people will spend a saturday to scream their raw disgust of you .
nothing else gets people to do that these days .
the best part was when you guys had to scamper from the rented gazebo and into a police van after cutting your rally short .
you had the shields and the flags and the gas masks .
fun little club names like the proud boys and shit .
it 's like like your live action role playing paunchy keyboard warriors who who fetishize history 's biggest losers like hitler nazis and the confederacy .
i just got enough experience to be a 10th level asshole ! ''
what 's worse is that we all know this alt-right horseshit has been simmering for years .
but a black guy is in the white house for eight scandal free dignified years and you guys hid .
you sat on your yahoo message boards or 4chan and spread your pepe memes all the while too chicken shit to actually come out of your mom 's basement .
but then came trump and your savior has arrived !
the thin skinned conman bolstered by a wave of russian propaganda and you were out and proud .
faces uncovered shit you guys were all sure your time had come .
cut to one of the organizers of charlottesville sobbing like a little bitch because how he was treated .
others lost their jobs and were ousted by their families for their repugnant views and every time they are on social media just crying about how unfair it is that no one is respecting your opinions '' .
as if in some magical way having opinions means you are exempt from people seeing you as the frightened tantrum throwing children you all are .

halts the campaign she has been working on for 7 seasons and takes her entire army and dragons north to help the northerners .
saves jon 's ass beyond the wall losing one of her children in return and promises to help the north for nothing in return .
cersei decides not to help and instead continue to fight against dany despite actually seeing the wights .
sansa is a northerner and knows about ww and all she did the entire season was whinge about jon trying to get help in their fight jon bend the knee in return for help ?
why does he never ask for my advice since he is a bastard and i am the rightful queen and know better than him about everything !
jon should consult with me first before making any decision !
why did jon go south to get dragon glass and soldiers ?
he should stay here and listen to me whingeing about how he should listen to me and ask for my advice .
if only arya was not around i could depose jon and become queen . ''
thankfully her brain cells started working before she gutted arya and realized that lf was playing her .
she 's a slow learner that 's for sure .
so both sansa and cersei were being shitty rulers who are more concerned about petty politics whilst dany halted something that has been her goal for 7 seasons and went north to help idiots like sansa .

it could have been an issue with them falling through but not dying so the spawn points were creating new ones .
i get that definitions vary between tribes and contexts but some of those definitions are wrong with a capital w precisely because they would never be used except to try and win an argument .
for example saying that there is a war on christmas seems to me not to be wrong in the overwhelming way that saying there is a plague of voter fraud is .
it 's hyperbolic sure but it 's an understandable metaphor/hyperbole .
the politics is ridiculous and the whole thing is a beat up but i do n't have a principled objection to it as a figure of speech .
partly this is because it 's not going to mislead in the essential respects people get the main idea .
it 's a defensible hyperbolic metaphor and i ca n't with any precision say that someone who says there is a war on christmas is wrong .
one well established metaphorical use of war is 'movement against ' and it does seem like all the lawsuits etc .
if however the total number of people committing voter fraud a year is a few hundred saying it 's a plague is indefensible .
it gives people the wrong idea of the essential situation i know you do n't think it 's a plague but my point is its deeply incorrect to call it a plague in a way that takes it beyond hyperbole to either error or deliberate falsehood .
no way of understanding plague in this context would include a a few hundred people across a nation of 300,000,000 with no discernible effect on anything . ''
some figures of speech or ways of defining are a bit naif others go too far .
at a certain point we are no longer stretching words we are just wrong .

i 'd say mcdonald 's had a canadian renaissance about 3-4 years ago .
improved quality in food new menu items and continual investments in the appearance and operation of their stores kiosks etc .
before i would never have suggested to go there for the food and coffee but i will now without reservation .
seriously compare wendy 's and tim 's food to mcdonalds .
i know it 's harder now that the game has already been going on but i would reduce gold rewards/incentives .
last campaign i was in we had a similar problem with a new dm who was just rolling on the tables after every few encounters or at the end of a short dungeon .
we were all getting way too much gold gems and sellable junk .
i am starting a new campaign soon and have decided to severely limit gold rewards .
the players are going to be closer to cowboy bebop working for just enough to stay fed for a few days .
my reasoning is simple small towns are generally pretty poor why would they have a lot of money to give out when 10gp is a lot of money to a villager ?
who just leaves stacks of gold lying around in a crypt/cave/dungeon dungeon in the literal prison sense it does n't make sense for hundreds of gp to just be lying around .
even merchants who deal in magical items probably do n't carry that much coin on them at any one time .
they are more likely to offer trade for other magical items .
maybe that magic sword nobody wanted to use could be traded for five healing potions or a magical dagger ?
edit other experiences have also proven that introducing more expenses to the players helps .
in an older game our dm had given us the deed to an old keep before we even hit level 5 .
it was in severe need of repair and upkeep it needed to be staffed and stocked with supplies .
a couple of us wanted to help cultivate the land to offset future upkeep costs which required initial investment capital for equipment and supplies .
this also gave our dm the opportunity to build story elements into one region rather than have us travel all over .
growing plotlines and consequences from previous choices developed around us .

i was considering it when looking for a sleeve but ultimately decided on the lacdo .
yours has the nice foam interior for protection but the lacdo had a medium and a larger pocket on the outside that benefited me more .
the large pocket holds my ipad air with a smart cover if need be .
no matter what though i was getting a case/sleeve for this thing .
the lacdo has a nice fleece-like interior so i 'm not worried about scratches .
decent buffer between the zipper and where the machine rests inside of it so no zipper scratches either .
most unfairly treated steeler by the fan base of all time .

the us attorney 's office can not end/block investigations by the state attorney .
they could possibly file a brief or sue to try and get the case remanded to federal court where they could fuck with it but there 's so much criminal history in trump 's background that there 's no way in hell even the most corrupt us atty could get it all pushed to federal .

i ran into similar issues in year 1 or 2 of d1 .
it was working fine before then bungie made an update and it quit working .
the fix for me was to not rely on my cable company router and get my own that has better plug and play support .
i then placed my second router in the dmz of my cable company router .
sounds complicated but it was n't too bad and it all works great .

both are good but both are also overloaded as fuck not sure about anycoin i think they are closed to new users but for litebit you need to be verified to even send because they raised the limits .
they also tend to run out of coins all the time .
oh and litebit got hacked two times in a row no funds lost just data stolen so keep that in mind as well .
true however it is still their job to keep the game in good shape .
when things go to shit at my office while i 'm on vacation i still get the call to come in because that is my job and i need to be there .

we have no clue as to whether this will be a good pc port .
for all we know the reason it 's going to take 10 months is because
a they have n't started yet and they need the finished console versions to start the port
b even with the people that will be free after releasing the console versions there is n't enough people to get even a basic port done any faster
c at any point in time we may choose to pull staff from port duties to work on fixes/expansions for the already live games
d in 10 months time it will be releasing in the holiday period and bad ports may be less of a news story than they will be at other times of the year .
e we 're stringing them along and we plan on cancelling the pc version .
but we do n't want bad press near the release of the main game .
we do n't want people who may double dip deciding that they are pissed at us and not going to buy the game .
i have a playlist dedicated to high quality instrumental music like the cirque du soleil soundtracks and the halo soundtracks and a bunch of other tidbits .
well yeah in that playlist is ‘you reposted in the wrong neighbourhood '
just wanted to let you know that as far as i 'm aware fish do n't have the concept of being full .
they 'll gorge themselves to death given the opportunity so it 's probably not underfed .
it 's a way better way of looking at frame data .
i think the in-game ui is p confusing and it 's especially so when you 're trying to compare moves in your moveset .

this is the point where their conscious decision for towers to act differently than in lol they do n't focus you if you 're hitting their heroes within their range is starting to show more than ever before .
never liked that towers acted this way makes pushing way too easy in a big group .

but i 'm not sure that all cricket fans are ok with calling people cunts ?
i 'm likely in my own bubble but none of the people i talk cricket with have mentioned calling people cunts or use of the word cunt on the cricket field .
calling someone a cunt aint even a good sledge and despite the memes calling people cunt in australia is only acceptable around close friends who are n't bothered by language .
well do n't be shy now i thought we were friends .
do n't know why probably just because i 'm used to it .
no competition with girar hot fuss is the clear winner .
i did n't end up smoking at all last night because my boyfriend came over he does n't smoke or really like that i smoke and i feel much better this morning .

b teams in spain are part of the footballing pyramid .
they regularly buy 24-28 year olds that will never have a chance of making the first team so the b team can have better results .
they dont even really have an pressure as the results are pretty much meaningless .
again in spain the b teams play in the footballing pyramid .
an assistant manager in a senior team and as giggs was for a bit the caretaker manager has greater responsability and more pressure
zidane was the assistant for ancelotti before he got promoted to the b team manager .
it 's ok to not know things but do n't try and pretend you 're some sort of expert in the matter .
someone no idea who asked if those of us who 'd subbed for tonight would still be cancelling ... here is my response seeing as the other thread is locked
this is insane but with two little kids and a shit load of work to do both at work and around the house i do n't have time to watch any wrestling anymore really .
i 'll be cancelling the wwe network after the rumble too .
but all in all so far this is amazing .
after taking the right medicines and taking them seriously life gets better .
be strength strong patience and by any reason stop medicines suddenly just because you 're feeling better
the reason many of these charities prefer money is because of infastructure issues .
for example a hypothetical charity that provides school supplies for needy kids .
you live in chicago lots of needy kids there !
but the charity already has enough crayons for chicago .
if you had donated the money to buy supplies this would not have been an issue .
but now they have to either find a place to store those surplus crayons or find a way to get them to atlanta .
and the people who have to do that are almost always unpaid volunteers .
this is just a simplified example and it 's why many charities who accept donations of supplies provide very specific lists of what they need and when .
so if you 're the kind of person who feels suspiciously about financial donations totally valid btw !
go and work for these charities for a few hours a month and see exactly what they 've got going on .
there really is no better way to know first-hand how donated funds are spent plus most places truly do need the hands .
so like i said in the other thread this is my first time watching this only been watching for 5 minutes but it 's good so far is this show their version of wrestlemania ?
also is this like a pg show or what ?
because i can see jericho 's match is no dq but i 'm just wondering what sort of match it 's going to be like is it going to be like a wwe pg no dq match ?
not me but a friend said i would rather hug a dozen strangers who need a hug a half dozen who are pressured into it and a few who are being dicks if it means i get to hug a hot chick every once in awhile '' awhile back .
he did n't have much game so i felt for him .
he has remained a huggy person since but it is more of a 'i like hugs ' situation than the pure desperation he had before though .
yea funny story actually when i packed him in the 81 inform pack i went to check his price and accidentally listed him .
then went to see this and i was just assuming it was button lag that made this person accidentally buy now .
how long do i have to wait if it is !
with the new ranking system which is very similar to tygem/foxy actually 2d is something around 1.5k kgs .
i do n't think there 's much hope of stopping brexit now .
but we can decide how we want to be remembered by history .
the cowards who went along with it because it was convenient ?
or the principled socialists who stood against the impoverishment of our country ?
i think that 's mostly a case of there are n't enough games in this genre to warrant a real term so we 'll just refer to the most popular/influential title of its type '' .
remember when all platform games were referred to as mario clones '' and first person shooters were doom clones '' ?
there 's three of em within ten minutes of eachoyher in wexford town !
well you can actually replace those now with some of the antorus trinkets but it 's still a solid trinket that did me nearly the whole expansion .
whilst i do think the example is severely flawed why downvote the thread ?

1 how to eliminate manipulation complete transparency which means data on pricing should be available to the public and regulators not just private business .
the services that sell pricing data have refused to sell to law enforcement .
transparency in refinery operations such as why they go down and how much gasoline each company has in reserve should be public .
this would help traders keep the market in balance and make them less able to 'trick ' each other .

as a leftist and a firm believer in human rights let me say i think kim jong un is a despicable excuse for a human being and i also hope that his family regime comes to an end for the sake of the north korean people and the world .
he is evil the regime is evil their government is evil .
that said i ca n't in good conscience find fault in a sovereign nation choosing to develop the same weapons everyone else has for the purpose of self-defense .
the whole idea behind mutually-assured destruction is that if countries are going to have nukes theoretically the more countries that have nukes the less likely they 'll be used .
kju even said in a recent statement that he feels more confident in the nuclear program and is now a little bit more prepared for talks than he had been .
he even pledged not to use them unless in self-defense which is more than i can say for trump .
what happened to those other dictators who surrendered their weapons because america said really we promise we 'll leave you alone if you just get rid of your weapons '' and then they were never heard from again ?
kju wants to preserve his dynasty and if nukes were out of the equation it would be much easier for the us to invade and take him out and reunify korea great in our eyes very very bad in nk 's eyes .
the past three presidents may have done nothing to stop nk 's development of nukes but trump is certainly not helping the situation .
we know that kju and nk have been undeterred and still making major developments in their weapons program .
and nuking them or trying to depose kju violently is going to end very badly for all of us if that 's what trump and his fanbase fantasize about .
i still do n't see it as a problem .
almost nobody pays attention to local races which is sad .
so the winners of these elections are usually people associated with parties that are energized .
in 2010 republicans came in with a wave and this year it looks like the democrats will do the same just like they did in 2017 .

hit ctrl f while in the main afterburner window to bring the editor up .
the bottom numbers are the voltage the left numbers are the core clock .
if you 're adjusting from a base clock all you need to do is move the point up the graph for the voltage you want let 's say 0.9500v until it 's above the current clock rate close the editor window and hit apply .
it should lock the card 's voltage and core clock at that it 'll round core to the nearest 13.5 step as long as you did n't set an unreasonable value that crashes it immediately .
do it in steps until a crash happens and you 'll get used to where to move the numbers eventually .
note if you want to lower or raise the volts after setting the curve once it gets pretty buggy and you 'll have to move and apply it a few times before it changes you can hit the reset button first and move a different voltage up to make that part easier .

you need to chill out before going out there like this and insult multiple demographics .

what sort of things could be done that would eliminate the manipulation ?
it seems like there are a lot of assumptions traders are making like soon to arrive ships will unload their cargo and then the ships do n't so then their bets that the oil would be cheap allow chevron to get cheap oil .
uh how do you set it up or change these markets so that they ca n't be manipulated ?
like who originally posted this and was it a joke or was this a serious handout given to front desk workers at a hilton hotel ?

hey guys putting my team together and planning out gear/roles .
the main one i am having trouble with is osa and panda ...
i want to focus him on aoe damage but dont know how viable that actually is ?
have n't included spells because they are pretty generic dragon osa fire/air setup .
removed shroud to inspect and found a fitting was cracked pic 2 .
removed motor and the metal tube attached to the tank which reveals a plunger check valve ?
trying to find out if there is anything else i need to check due to this damage but not finding much info on this unit nor any full parts lists qre available that i can find mod .
i imagine these fittings can be brought to a hardware store to replace .
anything else recommended for me to replace now that this thing is tore down this far ?
a few days ago i was in the middle of a 2v2 and the app froze .
it might have been that my phone ran out of memory when it happened i did what i usually do when that happens powered off the phone started it back up and then get back into clash royale as soon as possible so i can apologize to my clanmate .
usually this gets me back into cr though not into the battle my phone is encrypted it takes a while to decrypt upon startup .
as soon as i tap the icon i get unfortunately clash royale has stopped . ''
i 've viewed the documentation at https supercell.helpshift.com/a/clash-royale ? p=web but i 'm not sure if it 's signed in to google play or not it drops its sign ins to facebook on and off so i do n't know if uninstalling and reinstalling clash royale will force me to start all the way at the beginning again .
i 'm at 4002 trophies and i have invested money into this game i 'd really hate to lose my account .
is there a safe way for me to get back into clash royale with this account without needing to wait for an update from supercell ?
i 'm on a droid maxx on android 4.4.4 with encryption if that helps .
it must be the researched sweet spot of well its less than 20 '' .
i wish charity navigator was n't so full of shit so we can see the real transparency on these charities without dredging though stacks of 990s
ringworm 2 times in 2 months staph might of been just two ingrown leg hairs but probably not did 10 days on antibiotic just to be sure and the newest addition to my funk list is a couple warts on my chin after researching these terrible additions to my face they are apparently contagious and hard to get rid of.. i realized that i have n't been washing my gym bag but i do n't put 'post training ' gi/belt or rash guard in there only clean gis .
so i imagine it should stay clean for ever ?
i do throw my boxing gloves in there and my shin guards which in retrospect could be risky ?
i do have a mouth piece that i do n't really clean i keep on the side of my gym bag in a vented pocket i did n't realize how savage that was until i just wrote it .
i know i do n't sleep enough and i am constantly stressed outside of the bjj .
but maybe there is someone who hads the funk and now keeps it away consistently .
i can handle ring worm 3 or 4 times a year if it is really that common .
i am taking the month off and getting to doctor .
sorry for the long shit vent post in advance .
if i setup a toast wallet can i use the backup on a ledger nano s ?
basically i have a good amount of ripple but my ledger has n't showed up yet so i want to start a toast wallet first .
once i get the ledger do i just use the toast wallet backup on it ?
i want to avoid losing the 20 xrp in the first wallet .
so i got inspired and started producing not to long ago .
it definitely is something i want to pursue passionately .
i want to pursue it full time after college .
what advice do you have for a junior in college trying to pursue music after college .
right now my plan is to get a decent job in my field and then pursue a full time career in music production once i get experienced enough to do it full time .
for example my enemy team on horizon first point bastion orisa torb .
i can just throw some orbs into them and get my ult in 20 sec .
then when i have my ult i will put down the tp near point so my team has 12 chances .
and tell me what really counters symmetra on attack ?
people just have a picture of symmetra being a troll hero and bad .
i hate it i cant play symmetra because everyone thinks im a troll
idk if this is the right subreddit for this .
okay so basically i was on the last day of my period but i thought i would be cautious incase my period decided to stay an extra day so i stuck a tampon inside me .
i think i put it in kind of wonky because when i got up i could sort of feel it so i thought i should just pull it out because i probably would n't bleed anyway and i did n't want to feel uncomfortable for the rest of the day .
but when i yanked it out it looked kind of shredded if that makes sense ?
it was n't like a huge chunk of it came off but the sides kind of looked like cotton when you pull at it .
i was on the last day of/maybe finished my period so i was pretty dry .
anyway i got super worried and for the the rest of the day i kept thinking that some parts of it was inside me .
so it 's the next day now and i 'm not sure if this is just the placebo effect but i kind of feel like something is inside .
nothing hurts but i can feel something up there .
i 'm so scared that i will get toxic shock or something or that i 'll get some weird infection and my vagina will be ruined forever
i looked it up and most people are either saying that the period will wash it out or to visit a gynecologist .
but since i just finished my period i wo n't get it for another month which is more than enough time to get some vagina disease i also do n't think i have a gynecologist i 'm 17 .
idk i 'm super clueless so i do n't really have someone to professionally peek in there .
did the parts of the tampon just clean itself out after sometime ?
or do i have to fish it out myself ?
imnofox meets with a crowd of bay of plenty voters
hey bay of plenty it 's great to be here .
and bay of plenty gets to make a choice .
voting for strong progressive green-led government or a continuation of the failed neoliberal experiment that 's put thousands into poverty and made the rich richer while our environment suffers .
the environment of bay of plenty is simply beautiful and should be protected and cherished much like the people of this region too .
these plans will save our environment our planet and will lift thousands out of poverty whilst lowering living costs for the middle class .
this is tomorrow 's future and it 's the vision of the greens .
i was wondering how many of you use the mod .
i think of it as the definitive way of playing new vegas .
welcome everyone to the official streamers connected subreddit join our discord at discord.gg/streamersconnected
some people have been asking what i specifically do so i 'm going to make a little mini guide with some basic info .
to start i both trade and hodl and i 'll explain how i do that and what i use .
i basically started out by splitting my funds into two half for trading and half for a long portfolio that i 'm holding .
for trading i only trade whatever is on gdax and for holding i buy altcoins on binance .
i feel these are the two best exchanges with the best gui features and performance .
they also are the most trustworthy even though they are going thru growing pains from the explosion in popularity of crypto .
i also use a variety of apps and sites to track crypto .
i usually start by transferring usd to coinbase which takes a few days thanks to our awesome banking system not so much .
once the money is in cb i transfer it to gdax for trading or converting to either btc eth or ltc .
since we 're talking about trading now i 'll get to the transferring coins to other exchanges later .
for trading i set a basic goal per trade like 10 or 20 and i try to keep that pace thru swings between the big 3 coins .
i usually try to trade in btc pairs instead of usd since you can multiply your returns a lot if btc goes up .
it 's good to learn the relationships between usd btc eth and ltc ... you 'll lick it up from observing gdax after a while .
so that 's pretty much it i try to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible thru swings .
i try to stick to using limit orders for 2 reasons safety in case of a slowdown or crash and because they are free so you avoid fees .
it 's best to use limit orders because if things slow down you wo n't lose money like you would with a market order .
binance is the best place for altcoins which is basically a term for a thing that is n't btc .
someone could trade altcoins on binance if they wish but i feel it 's just better to hodl thru a well selected portfolio .
my strategy here is pretty basic i just try to split my funds evenly over the top 10-15 coins by market cap with some extra funds going to coins with more hype and potential like xrp for example .
there 's examples floating around that people who did this with 1000 in 2017 ended up with portfolios worth almost 50k a year later .
while that may not be typical it shows you what 's possible if done right and with a bit of luck .
i usually transfer funds from gdax to binance to avoid fees and i usually do it by sending btc eth or ltc .
ltc is the fastest but btc is n't terrible it usually takes 30-90 mins .
unfortunately binance does have small fees on limit order but gdax does not which is why i trade on gdax .
for tracking i found this neat app called coin stats on ios .
it lets you follow the top coins and enter your trades to keep track of your portfolio .
for charts i use my trusty investing.com charts or tradingview but they are both the same since investing.com uses tradingview .
now if on a browser you can alway go to coinmarketcap.com or livecoinwathc.com to track how coins are doing .
the reason i like the coin stats app is because it pulls info from these 2 sites and multiple exchanges .
for research i just try to google the altcoin i 'm interested in or i chat with people on discord or stocktwits a bit .
if you have any questions just comment below or catch us on discord .
edit i wanted to add in light of the recent dips its always good to have dry powder '' aka some good ol ' fiat usd in your exchange account or on the side ready to be transferred to your favorite exchange in case some huge drops happen .
these are good times to get crypto at a discount and hodl until they rise .
so it was a few weeks before julie could come over again .
chuck and i had our usual fun with our other friends but when we were alone all chuck talked about was julie .
he was amazed by how tiny she was and how tight her body was .
not surprising since she 's a vegetarian and runner .
it 's funny to see what a crush chuck has on her .
he 's kind of awkward around her and i 'm the one who always corresponds with her and arranges our hook ups .
she and i have actually become even more friendly but i know she has a thing for chuck 's huge cock .
she is constantly amazed that i can take it and she has told me the thought of chuck fucking her ass both scares her and fascinates her .
a couple of weeks ago julie came over with her new partner .
short bleached blond hair and wool beenie with a plaid shirt and skinny jeans .
she wore thick black rimmed buddy holly style glasses and had a hoop in her right nostril .
when we made the introductions she had a firm handshake and looked us right in the eyes .
so i heard you two out on quite a show.
we aim to put on the best gay sex show this side of the mississippi. i rolled my eyes and smiled at julie .
i 'll be the judge of that said chris looking right back at chuck with a total poker face that wiped the grin right off chuck 's face .
julie and i bust out laughing and then so did chris and chuck .
let 's have drinks and smoke some weed i said and we all tromped off to the kitchen for cocktails or beers .
chuck and chris both had a yummy porter from a local brewery while i made julie and i some dark and stormies .
she looked amazing in a turquoise sweater and black leggings so tight you could pretty much see the entire outline of her mons .
what 's in the bag ? i asked as we made our way to the living room drinks in hand .
oh just a few extra pieces of equipment for the phallic-ly challenged said chris as we sat on the sofas .
chuck and i sat on one sofa with chris and julie on the other sofa .
julie opened her bag and started spread out a towel on the coffee table in between us .
then she started laying out the different toys they had brought .
there were was a long purple double ended dildo several smaller smooth shiny metallic vibrators two strap on harnesses and a variety of different cocks of various shape size and color that were all compatible with either harness .
that 's a pretty nice collection i said thinking of my friend evan 's collection of toys and how this was nothing compared to what he had .
i have to leave most of it at home of course .
it 's not like i 'm going to bring almost 100 dildos over to your house.
she has a lot of dildos said julie nodding her head in agreement .
we sat for a while looking at the different toys she had brought .
the double ended dildo she called the purple pussy eater and she liked to use it when she was tribbing .
the small shiny vibrators were for the clit or in the butt for double penetration when you just wanted something a little extra .
there were five rubber dicks that went with the strap ons and the biggest one was as long as chuck but thicker and with a bigger tip .
i picked it up and held it up to admire it while i sat back on the sofa .
i thought you might like that one julie said with a sly grin .
we were all looking at chuck now and he blushed a little .
well shucks fellas he said kinda sheepishly am i the only one taking off his jeans ?
i 'm rolling a joint i said getting the supplies from under the coffee table .
and i 'm not wearing jeans i 'm wearing leggings said julie .
chuck was starting to look uncomfortable as we all stared at him .
slowly he started to fumble with the button and zipper of his jeans .
he pulled them down to reveal bright yellow bikini trunks that barely covered his six inch flaccid cock .
well if we 're gon na compare dicks i guess i should at least put mine on said chris standing up and unbottoning her jeans as well .
she wore black boxer briefs and hestitsted for a few seconds before pulling them down to reveal a fairly hairy brunette bush .
she did not make eye contact with us as she fumbled out of her black chuck taylor sneakers and the rest of her bottoms .
once she was naked from the waist down she slipped her skinny legs through the straps and put the big black ten inch dildo into front slot .
we had all watched her while she did this and now chuck hurried up to get out of his pants .
his bikini bottoms could no longer contain his erection and a full five inches of dick was already sticking above his waistband .
he stood up and stepped out of his jeans and underwear .
chris and chuck stood across from each other with their enormous cocks hanging out over the coffee table .
i 'm just gon na sit back and enjoy this view i said as i lit the joint i was finally done rolling .
i took a big drag and passed it to julie .
stand side by side so we can really compare the two directed julie .
chris and chuck each went to the end of the coffee table and stood side by side .
there was no doubt that both dicks were just as long but chris 's was just a little thicker with a much bigger glans .
i just hung there however not quite stiff not quite soft .
chucks rod on the other hand stood out straight and proud with a slight curve to the up and right .
you guys look hot i said and took another big drag of the joint and got up and brought it over to chris .
i handed her the joint and then reached down with both hands and took a cock in each .
chuck 's cock felt warm and familiar but chris 's felt cold and foreign .
i got down in front of them to examine them closer while chris passed the joint to chuck .
the tip was perfectly proportioned to the length and girth which meant it was huge .
chuck 's dick was the biggest real one i had ever had but i knew there were bigger and i was ready to try more .
i turned to my left and there was chuck 's monster cock right in my face .
the glans was smaller and pointier than chris 's rubber monster but from the tip oozed a tiny translucent drop of pre-cum .
as i moved in closed i could smell the musky aroma of real cock and my mouth started to water despite all the weed i had smoked .
i stuck out my tongue and touched it to chuck 's tip tasting his sweet nectar .
yeah suck his cock urged chris as i let the string of pre-cum stretch from the dip of my cock to chuck 's pee hole .
i did n't need any more encouragement and immediately attacked his dick like a starving man before a buffet .
i was a little too anxious to show off at first swallowing his whole cock and gagging at fist .
both girls apparently thought that was funny and laughed so i did it again .
ca n't you handle it ? chris asked me with one eyebrow raised .
of course i can i said and relaxed my throat and buried his cock in my mouth balls deep .
i held it there enjoying the smell of his pubes as they tickled my nose .
i pulled back to the tip and then forward again until i could feel his pubic hair touching my nose again .
julie i think kent here could show you a thing or two about how to suck a cock. she was looking at julie who had been relaxing on the sofa enjoying the show with her cocktail .
i know he could said julie getting up and coming across the room to stand beside chris .
but i 'm not going to practice on this monster. she reached down and grabbed her girlfriends monster dildo and swung it around a few times .
but if you want to be my nasty gay twink boy you 're gon na have to learn how to suck cock like that. they both turned and watched me swallow chuck 's cock again .
it was at this point i realized they were going to put away the big dick and i was honestly disappointed .
if you 're going to put on something smaller i said to chris then julie should put on the big one. i could tell julie liked the idea when she popped up and started peeling off her clothes .
she took off her sweater first to reveal that she was n't wearing a bra .
her chest was almost completely flat with puffy pink nipples .
next she peeled off her leggings and her panties came off with them .
she said she had all the hair down there lasered off and says she loves the way it looks and feels .
after she had taken off her clothes she slipped on strap-on harness with the big black dick she put back on her adidas running shoes .
we were all staring at her as she slipped them on .
if i 'm gon na fuck someone with this thing i 'm gon na need some traction. we all laughed and chuck choked on the big hit he had just taken from the joint .
by now chuck was naked with a beautiful boner chris was naked except for her strap-on and a tight fitting black sports bra julie was naked except for her enormous strap-on and her sneakers and i was on my knees in front of all of them still completely clothed .
they all gathered around me and i feasted on their cocks .
chris had on something closer in size to my cock about 7 inches but on either side of her was chuck 's enormous dick and julie 's even bigger rubber phallus .
i sampled them all showing the laddies how i could swallow chuck 's rock hard sword and even deep throating julie 's monster dildo .
the real thing just tastes better and i could tell that chris and julie both liked watching me pleasure chuck .
they all hovered above me sipping their drinks and watching me devour inch after inch of flesh and rubber .
after a while i was getting thirsty and i noticed they had all finished their drinks as well .
i need a little alcohol to wash down all this penis i said and which earned me a giggle from julie .
chuck and chris headed off to the kitchen to get us drinks while julie lay back on the sofa and relit the half smoked joint .
i quickly finished the rest of my beverage while i got undressed .
i was starting to feel a little akward being the only one who was n't naked and my hard on really wanted to be free of it 's cotton prison .
once i had taken of my clothes i plopped down on the sofa next to julie and plucked the joint out of her hand .
i took a big drag leaned back and closed my eyes .
i must admit i was a little surprised when a felt a hand grip the base of my cock and looked down to see julie leaned over my crotch intently examining my manhood and licking her lips .
oh i 'm gon na said julie looking up and holding my gaze for several seconds as she bit her lower lip .
what a sexy queer girl i thought as she lowered her head and tried to deep throat all 7 inches of my dick .
it did n't go well and she gagged almost immediately .
damn she said coming up for air and wiping saliva from the corner of her mouth .
how do you suck a cock all the way to the base without gagging ?
and think about breathing through your nose. she lowered her head more slowly this time and made it a good two thirds of the way down before gagging again .
i can feel it when it hits the back of my throat. she said .
when you feel it hit the back of your throat stop and let it stay there for a second .
get used to that feeling before you go down further. she lowered her head again and when i felt the tip of my cock against back of her throat she stopped and let it set there for a second before coming back up .
the next time she went just a little further paused and came back up and on the third time she took my whole cock down her throat until my pubic hair tickled her nose and came back up again without gagging .
not bad said chris who had returned to the living room holding a beer and a cocktail for julie .
i 've been giving her lessons i explained as i took my drink from chuck who stood there admiring julie 's new trick .
ever since she came over to your guys house and watched you fuck it 's all she 's been able to talk about chris went on .
we watch gay porn every night and she always wants to rim me or have her ass fucked .
she wants to be a good cock sucker but i 've never been much for it so i did n't really have any good advice for her.
i do n't mind giving her a few pointers i said as she continued to suck my cock while we watched .
chuck 's dick was hard again and he knelt beside me on the sofa so i could suck his cock while julie sucked me .
chris stood back and admired the whole scene while she sipped her beer .
eventually she went behind julie and started to smack he ass and spread her cheeks .
julie moaned as she continued to slobber all over my dick with the enthusiasm of an 18 gay kid getting his first taste of cock .
chris spread julie 's butt cheeks nice and wide and stared with hunger at julie 's tight puckered butt hole .
she leaned in and licked lightly all around the edge before going in and attacking the center .
fuck yeah eat my ass she moaned as she ground her ass back and up into chris 's face and chris shoved her tongue further up julie 's ass .
i 'm gon na eat me some ass too and he pulled his dick out of my mouth and spun me around so i was on my hands and knees like julie .
he spread my cheeks and dove straight in licking and slurping all around my hungry hole .
now chuck was kind of bent over in front of julie eating my ass so julie figured she would get her some ass too and dove straight in and started eating chucks ass .
eventually fingers started going up butts and before long the room was filled with the wet slurping sounds assholes being vigorously rimmed .
eventually julie was the first one to say what we were all starting to think about .
chris who already had two fingers up julie 's butt said sure thing you nasty girl and slowly slid her strap-on dildo up her girlfriends wet and sloppy back door .
fuck yeah moaned julie 's as chris slowly started to work her rubber dick in and out .
can someone hand me the small silver vibe she asked blindly sticking out her hand for her toy .
i 've got it said chuck who had three fingers up my wet hole but his reach was long enough he could get the toy of the coffee table without having to stop fingering my butt .
he handed the little silver bullet to julie and we heard it buzz to life as she reached under her strap-on harness and started rubbing her clit .
now it 's your turn chuck said turning me so i was facing the back of the sofa right next to julie .
i felt his tip against my hole and then he was inside me .
chris watched as he took a couple of long slow strokes before he started to pick up the pace to a more steady rhythm .
chris matched his speed as she fucked julie 's ass and julie moaned loudly .
i was also starting to moan and looked to the side to see julie looking back at me .
i had probably kissed fifty guys since i had split up with my wife but she was the first girl i had kissed in over a year .
her body was starting to shiver and convulse uncontrollably as her first orgasm started to build .
chris and chuck were both pounding our asses in almost perfect time when i started to hear chuck grunting .
his thrusts became deeper and harder and soon he was unloading his seed deep inside my ass .
after sliding his dick in and out of my cum filled ass a few more times chuck popped his dick out and a big wad of cum slipped out of my ass and down my balls .
that looks so nice said chris as she reached out and smeared the cum running out of my ass all over my balls and ass cheeks .
but you know what i want now that i 'm all worked in and lubed up is that big cock that julie 's wearing.
julie go behind me and put her sneaker clad feet firmly on the floor .
the monster sized tip of her ten inch dildo slid past my cum lubed back door easily and it was n't long until tiny little julie was pounding my ass as hard as she could .
i reached down and grabbed my cock and stroked it while julie rammed it home .
it was n't too long before i new i was going to cum .
i reached down with my other hand and tried to catch most of my cum as i exploded into my hand .
as julie finally pulled out of me i rolled over and licked my hand clean .
chris still had n't cum but had taken off her strap-on and was masturbating furiously in the corner of the sofa .
after pulling out of me julie got down in front of chris 's hairy pussy and started taking care of her girlfriend .
chuck and i lounged together kissing languidly as we watched julie enjoy eating chris 's wet cunt .
we all lounged around naked drinking and smoking weed .
julie eventually tried sucking chuck 's dick but it was too big for her and she decided she needed more practice .
she did however get chuck 's dick in her pussy while chris dildoed her butt and i let her practice her dick sucking skills on me .
i envied her a little that she had three holes all filled and i only had two holes to fill .
i did get both my holes filled again before the end of the night as they all took turns fucking my ass and chuck eventually came in my mouth too .
it was without a doubt one of the hottest nights of my life and we plan to have more adventures together .
i ca n't believe we found two horny chicks who like gay sex as much as we do .
i had a check on the faq for how look for places to live but it just took me to a subreddit search of moving '' .
i 'm moving over to melbs from new zealand to start my job at monash university and i 'm a tad overwhelmed .
i 'm just not really sure how to find places to live in terms of which neighbourhoods are the good ones to look at or which websites .
if anyone here knows perth i 've lived in leederville before which i loved .
that 's kind of the vibe i 'm looking for so i 've been recommend windsor south yarra richmond etc ...
wondering if there are any closer to the clayton campus i should be looking at .
otherwise i 'm on flatmates.com.au and a bunch of facebook groups for housemates .
the reasoning behind a downward sloping ad curve is the wealth effect as price level decreases consumers have more money to spend because goods are cheaper so they spend more and save more thus increasing the c and i components of rgdp .
however this reasoning only holds true in the short run .
eventually wages will decrease to the same level as the pl .
for example if the pl drops from 10 to 5 people will have twice the wealth as before because things are cheaper to buy .
but in the long run wages will decrease to match the pl so even though the stuff people buy is cheap they will also get cheap wages .
therefore people will eventually end up with the same wealth to spend as they had under the 10 pl and thus in the long run the real gdp will return to the initial level .
with this reasoning there should be a vertical lrad long run curve and a downward sloping srad short run .
i have an itch for a new band ... actually i think i have an itch for a couple of new bands .
i 've been looking at a lot of them and theme i see most often is bands that are good for the price '' .
that is to say you can only expect so much from a 20 band on amazon .
all of these bands seem to have 10-15 bad reviews that say the bands fell apart in some cases damaging the watch finish wore off quickly or in some extreme cases the lugs became stuck in the watch .
i 'm on the hunt for some good quality bands that are n't focused on being low cost .
such as stainless steel bands that have great fit and finish and feel like they belong on high quality watch .
so far i 've come across these that i 'm interested in checking out further
hermès sadly single tour rallye is only sold with the watch
are there any other high quality bands to look at ?
can anyone comment on the quality of these after wearing them for a while ?
according to the article from fomos the head of sk telecom t1 kyung-shik oh said skt will make a pro team for pubg .
he said i 'm not in a hurry to make a team .
we will thoroughly look through how the pubg leagues roll and bring some news in august . ''
the head coach of skt t1 's pubg team will be ccarter the former head coach of skt 's lol team .
i know they do different roles but what would you say would be better in the long run
ok you know you want to show off that stunt stick of yours .
or better yet you want to show off all five of your skate bananas .
line 'em up on the living room carpet or prop them against the closet door in your dorm and take the blurriest goddamn cell phone picture you can then post it here where nobody cares .
or maybe somebody does care and you can talk about which banana is best .
honestly though if you have a rad quiver and you want to show it off or maybe you just bought your first full set-up or you 're stoked on a new pair of goggles or whatever post 'em here .
this is the time of the month that you wish will never arrive .
fuck this cramps its like satan stabbing the lining of my uteros
so i currently have 5 things a gpd xd a gpd win a nvidia shield portable and homebrew enabled psp and homebrew enabled n3dsxl with an extended battery .
all of them are fantastic for retro gaming and emulation .
unfortunately they all still have some decent bulk to them though still more practical than a switch imo .
i was hoping to find a smaller device maybe about the size of a gba that could serve a similar purpose even if i had to be limited to snes~gba etc .
possibly raspi based but unfortunately i ca n't find anything readily available for purchase .
on a little side note i also have both a moga hero power and a moga pro power for my phone and while they allow for a lot more variety in gaming than a raspi would i 'm still very curious about this sort of thing .
... or can you only pay in person to one of the payment locations ?
is it any helpful bcz i see most of the people to be 99 in dz and i got no clue why someone to be max lvl in dz lol .
i lost track of the story years ago and ca n't seem to find it anymore .

looking for a gaming laptop with a 1060 and 16gb ram .
looking at rtz sf during their game vs complexity captains draft it always boggles my mind how much cs he has by 20-25 mins but when i look at the replay i do n't feel impressed .
although when i play sf in pubs it 's so hard to replicate how much cs he has by a certain time .
so in essence do any of you have any special tips on having high cs ?
i know the timings for jungle rotations 40 sec and i know that creeps meet at about xx:17 mid but apart from that i dont know how to boost my cs more
and is it worth it to come back to mid after wiping some neutral camps when the lane is pushing back to your tower ?
because i feel like there is a lot of time wasted walking to and from jungle camps when i do this
so i know i am just beating a dead horse but this ripping away of 8 hours of pay from us on christmas is just plain wrong .

then maybe then corporate will realize that they employ human beings .
i 've visited several crossword bookstores and none of them had any place to sit and read .
its collection is limited one ca n't find every book there .
and it does n't offer any discount on the most of the books .
i buy a lot of books mostly from amazon and amazon offers huge discounts any book can be found there .
and books are delivered within a couple of days and the condition of books is always great .
on the other hand i 've found some books in crossword bookstore have a bit used feel to them especially if they 've been on the shelf for a long time and a lot of books have crossword stickers pasted on them .
i like browsing books shelves discovering new books and the smell of new books .
every time i spot a crossword store i walk inside it but in the end i leave without buying anything from there because i ca n't find a reason to pay 100 for a book to crossword while i can get the same book from amazon on 30-50 discount .
but there a lot of crossword book stores i wonder how many still buy books from crossword bookstore regularly and what could be the reasons to prefer it over online sellers ?
i was looking on nasa'a twitter and they posted a video of the sojourner climbing a boulder on mars .
so we 've had barry as a boss rb tony g te moss wr bo weird/everything ray mlb but no qb ... what better guy to have a boss than elway who rode off into the sunset after a super bowl victory and then won one as a gm ?

i 'm open minded and nerdy i guess you 'd say .
i enjoy gaming movies music food anime and art .
i 'm looking for someone fun to chat with when feeling bored .

hey guys i think i may be a pschopath .
i have these strange urges that make me want to do really shitty stuff .
is there any way to get rid of this ?

i 'm at taco bell right now and a big order came up and no one claimed it .
i 'm still waiting for my food and want to be helpful so i go over to the corner where there 's two big tables with no food and a group of people in their 20s at a table covered in coloring books .
i lean around the corner and ask if the food belonged to the two food less groups and one person from each table hopped up to go check .
one of the girls at the coloring table looks at me rolls her eyes and says um we do n't work here ! ''
as though i 'd demanded she be a waitress to the other tables and check on their food .
my own food was ready so i wandered off .
now i 'm waiting for a strange version of this to pop up here from that other girl 's perspective !

i would suggest checking all of these periodically as they are likely to be frequently revised as more information becomes available .
any universe or character in a movie you want to see explored further ?
also is there a movie you ca n't believe they have n't made a sequel to ?
for example movies like top gun a tom cruise starrer action thriller blockbuster movie with almost endless possibilities to make an easy money grab sequel .
we talk about needless sequels and reboots all the time .

i found a serum by luxebeauty called skin lightener brightener on iherb for 49 1oz .
opuntia tuna fruit prickly pear extract agave tequilana leaf blue agave extract cypripedium pubescens lady 's slipper orchid extract opuntia vulgaris cactus extract aloe barbadensis leaf extract saccharomyses cerevisiae yeast extract lactic acid caprylic/capric triglyceride butylene glycol squalane cyclomethicone dimethicone ppg-12/smdi copolymer stearic acid cetearyl alcohol and ceteareth20 glyceryl stearate and peg-100 stearate arnica montana flower extract peg-75 meadowfoam oil glycyrrhiza glabra licorice root extract cymbopogon schoenanthus lemongrass oil triethanolamine xantham gum phenoxyethanol steareth-20 dmdm hydantoin .
they seem to contain similar brightening botanicals such as licorice root extract as well as lactic acid although i 'm not sure of the concentration in the luxebeauty serum .
do you think it would provide a similar exfoliating and brightening effect ?
i recently purchased a new rog x hero with an i7-8700k yes currently deciding to keep it even with meltdown/spectre and a 960 pro nvme 512gb as my os/main drive .

often a site will request permission for my location or to send desktop notifications .
i usually say no but there are rare occasions in which my answer would be yes .
so is there some way to make the requests quiet maybe showing a small icon in the address bar rather than a pop-up without automatically denying ?

so i just got my cage in last night .
i 'm having an issue with it though whenever i try to put it on i get hard to even semi-hard and the ring gets pulled further than i 'd like from my body .
the ring fits fine and all so it 's not that .
is there any easy way to stay completely soft while putting on a cage ?
because i 'm having a bit of a heh hard time here .
so i 've had my current desktop for just over 5 years and recently in the past few months it has started to randomly turn itself off then immediately turn itself on .
it 's been happening more frequently the past few weeks .
one instance when it happened the computer 'struggled ' to turn back on almost like a car trying to start its engine i watched the fan light on my case go in and out as it was trying to turn on .
i immediately turned the pc off at the power supply and turned it back on about 10mins later .
i 've checked the event viewer and everytime this has happened there has been a critical 'event id 41 ' event .
a quick google search tells me all this is likely to do with the psu though i just wanted to ask to see if it could be anything else before i possibly shell out for a new psu .

i have actually started getting into competitive breeding and i have been trying to come up with ideas for pokemon that are not commonly used but are fairly effective nonetheless .
regarding icos the entrepreneurs behind these projects raise huge amounts of capital to launch their new coins but the promoters own most of the coins and control most of the associated computing power with which they can update and improve their systems .
improvement sounds good but the effect is to reintroduce the custodian the elimination of which is the very purpose of the blockchain technology .
this is from an upcoming book by saifedean ammous .
i think it makes a good point but i also think that projects naturally start with centralization but ideally should end up completely decentralized .
and how would someone determine how decentralized a project is .
daughter almost six has developed an open bite due to tongue thrust .

also has anyone heard of or used a myomunchee ?

i moved to iceland where lava caves abound and there are huge areas of untamed wilderness including most of the interior .
but where to start looking for unexplored or undiscovered caves ?
do i have a better shot of finding lava caves along the mid-atlantic ridge ?
maybe bárðarbunga since there was an eruptions there in 2014-2015 ?
just getting to that area would be a big project in itself so if i go i want to be prepared .
but if other areas are more probable to host caves then i 'll skip bárðarbunga altogether .
i 'm probably going to have to invest in an infrared camera perhaps mounted on a drone to find hidden cave entrances in any given area .
every time a monster crits remove a sanity marker from target hero es .
if all markers are removed and a crit happens roll a die if a crit the hero dies immediately heart attack .
if no sanity markers ca n't use hero ability .
at rest add one sanity marker to each hero not to exceed 3 per hero .
i only completed the first heist with a friend and now want to do the other ones for the bonus 1 million .
i 'm not allowed to be vulnerable or intimate or close to humans .
i grew up in a generations long perpetuated abuse .
i am not allowed to be any of those things my brother and dad tortured me for years but if i was n't on the receiving end i 'd have been them were genetically the sane a d i grew up in a similar environment it killed my younger brother .
i 'm a girl but i ca n't be allowed to perpetuate the cycle .
but i still crave what all of you have and why should n't i just die ive guided young people into getting treatment for their issues going to uni leaving abusive homes but other then that let 's be honest i 'm one person in 7 billion who will never share a life with another human its wrong and not allowed to .
i wo n't impact the world i 'm just taking up space .
its the next logical step it ends the possibility of being my abusers .
i 'm going to try to enact this as easily as i can .
i beat the cycle of abuse it ended with me .
it does n't power up nor any lights light up .
when i opened it up i found just a loose piece and not any other significant damage .
should i sodder it to the contact or is my laptop dead ?
once the wookiee warrior is nerfed these guys wo n't be all that great to choose .
i mean they are hardly worth getting with the exception of the ww currently .
part of the reason besides most of them feeling weak is the drastic reduction in battle points earned .
vehicles do n't have that and you can rack up a ton more kills for less investment and earn way more bp profit than choosing a reinforcement class .
oh btw i think the death trooper and ww should have their grenades switched .
that will help in balancing the ww without making it useless again .
and make it so their bolts are blockable by lightsaber users who themselves need reworking .
this would indirectly nerf both chewbacca in hvv and the ww against melee heroes
we 're a long-standing league and we 're looking to replace/fill some owners that we 've recently lost due to the usual drop in interest with the end of the nfl regular season .

hello everyone i 've been lurking this channel for a while started keto after thanksgiving and lost have lost about 10 lbs which is great considering i 've been attempting to lose weight for multiple years and last year was a complete platue where i lost and gained the same 5 pounds .
my question involves returning to college where i have a meal plan .
i go to a small school which has not the greatest food .
their salads is often covered in freezer burn so badly where you can see through the pieces .
on weekdays they do have a grill where they serve cheeseburgers and rarely grilled chicken .
they have a sandwich station soup station a healthy '' station which is usually some kind of overcooked meat or chicken the main line usually has some heavy carb options .
weekends are n't much better and they take away the grill option .
i get about 100 dollars a month to spend on food and do not have any cooking options in my dorm other than a kettle and a microwave .
what are some items i can buy at walmart that would be good for my situation ?
what kinds of foods can i eat at my campus cafeteria other than the cheeseburgers without the bun and the grilled chicken ?
our school does not really try very hard and the employees are n't helpful when you ask for carb or calorie counts other than the papers that have the serving sizes which they never follow and give you much less .
for example the sheet will have the calorie count for an 8 oz piece of chicken and they 'll give you 3 oz they do n't measure .
when scott made the first game he had to have made some kind of document of the lore .

edit just as a preface my account was never banned or anything i am not trying to get around being banned .
i am coming back to this game after a few month hiatus and i am having trouble resetting my password which i seem to have forgotten since the last time i played .
i have tried to reset my password through the email system selecting forgot password etc. .
i never receive any emails from jagex about resetting my password .
yes i have checked my spam other folders etc .
i did a bit of research and found out that jagex seems to be having issues with aol emails .
i happen to have an aol email associated with my account i made the account a long time ago ... .
becuase of this i went through the long account recovery process where you enter in past payment information etc .
and at the bottom it gave me the option to change my associated email so i changed it to my gmail account .
after waiting a few days and not receiving any emails i tried to reset my password again but this time using the new gmail account i associated with it before .
this was all about 2-3 weeks ago i kinda forgot about the whole thing over the holidays .
but i still have not received any information from jagex on resetting/recovering my password/account .
i have scoured the runescape website in hope of finding a way to email/contact someone at jagex to see if something can be done about this but i have yet to find anything .
is there any way to get in contact with them and try to sort this out since their automated systems do not seem to be working ?
so as it pretty much is with every single guy i woke up as hard as a rock this morning and i 've got no one with me to help me do something about it .
i 'm mostly just looking to chat about any experiences or kinks or fantasies we wan na share .
even maybe sharing any porn we 've seen recently or one of your favourites i 'm down !
i find that getting to know someone and finding out what makes them all hot and bothered a lot hotter than roleplaying .
so yeah i 'm quite open minded and have a lot of kinks which include cock worship blowjobs light bdsm hentai/rule34 lingerie.. that 's just some i can think of from the top of my head lol .
if you 've managed to make it this far please include a little bit about yourself in your message too and what you want to talk about !
it might be fun to try out the new chat feature too if you like
also feel free to message as long as this is up .

hi im here because i just got this 1050 ti and i tried lots of different settings in pubg and none gave me steady 60 fps anybody know why ?
figured i 'd give sfo a run in wh2 .
i used to play it in wh1 and enjoyed it .
unfortunately i 've found that sfo reduces unit size .
for high elf spear men they should be at 120 units but with sfo on they only have 100 .
is this intended or a possible bug in code ?

i would n't compare it to holding any other post or being in any other job but i would think he would still have the right to take action if being slandered or libelled .
not suggesting he has been as cease and desist letters are often attempting to frighten but it 's an interesting question .

thanks for these questions i analyze wholesale prices both the price charged to gas station owners and the price charged between oil companies .
i watch the ships to see if they are purposely moving to 'trick ' a market .
as for oil industry info i get my information straight from oil sources i love oil and gas this week podcast oilprice.com reuters bloomberg any business news source really .
here 's a copy-paste from a different post about ais ship movements
yes i use ais tracking to monitor the vessels .
the data is gathered by ais but is viewed through third party services .
anyone can check out all the ships on the ocean at marinetraffic.com www.marinetraffic.com or vesselfinder.com www.vesselfinder.com .
in order to see ship history you have to pay a higher fee .
most of my experience has been using bloomberg 's ship tracking software on their bloomberg terminal program .
it 's expensive but the best in the business .
you can see any ship and anywhere it 's ever been in its history .
2 what kind of patterns do i look for ?
tankers can manipulate markets in a variety of ways .
the most important thing is whether there is adequate competition in the market .
for example the united states west coast has only a few companies and thus they have a huge amount of control over local commodity markets .
oftentimes a ship will put a false heading into their public movement profile via ais .
for example a tanker will say they are heading to los angeles when really they are going to cross through the panama canal .
just the rumor of an incoming ship can impact regional prices .
sometimes companies try to lower the price right before they are scheduled to make a big purchase .
for example chevron knows it is making a big purchase in the afternoon so they trick the market into thinking a bunch of oil or gasoline tankers are on the way .
the price will fall then they make their big purchase and save themselves a fortune when really they created a false wave of imports .
another tactic is showing up in a port with an expected shipment and then simply not completing the shipment and leaving making the regional price of oil or gasoline skyrocket .
this is going to make me all paranoid lol .
i 'm pretty sure most players ' passes are to the nearest teammate in most situations not sure about your point .
are you disputing that having a high pass accuracy is harder to do in midfield than in defense ?
also kroos is very much capable of playing inch perfect long balls and forward passes .
yes that is what i am wondering will the destruction of your cognitive aspect stop you from reaching the beyond ?
and another question how would this affect the fused ?
even if he was willing to pay market price i doubt anyone would rent to him .
looked through there and could n't find one as well .
i do n't think it was a logo it was just a black plate like the custom ones and it started with gl .

but it prevented her from trying anything else until she was over the crisis period .

slavery is obviously too far but the sentiment that the ufc is predatory is true .
fighters are absolutely underpaid and the fact that wme took on so much debt to buy the ufc is their own problem .
the ufc underpaying them would also be more valid if fighters were n't locked into contracts like they are currently .
it 's an organization that should be hit by government if our institutions were doing their jobs .
i still feel like conor is being annoying by not defending and i 'm not sympathetic to him wanting to make 100 million instead of 15 .
i 'd be on board if he was leading calls for a fighters union to get a larger share of the pie and was holding out on those terms though .
if fighters collectively only take in 20-30 percent of the whole pot that 's ridiculous and borderline theft .
when he acts like a jackass he ruins what should be a valid movement against the ufc .
but this ignores the change in time period between the starts of the industries .
tobacco companies did what they did in the beginning because it was good for business and no one cared .
the organic/healthy/natural movement has spread to the point i can get organic peanut butter at the pharmacy around the corner .
no one will buy their chemical-ridden stuff when they can go to a small business which are cool now and buy better cleaner weed for a slightly higher markup .
it 's not like this is a new industry .
the channels people have taken to get weed before wo n't go away .
pm has to deal with not just guerrilla marketing but guerrilla sales too .
they do n't have the ability to define the market because the market already exists .
all they can do is make it more easily accessible .
the game seems to ignore it for grief points '' you ca n't go pink from torping yourself .
i 've done this in cvs before not to grief but because we were soundly beaten and i wanted to get to the next match faster rather than play the chase-the-cv-around-the-corners-until-time-runs-out '' game that occasionally happens .
it 's good that you are questioning the seemingly unanimously positive stories .
for instance i really do sometimes get genuinely hungry even when sticking faithfully to my macros sometimes i overeat on overly snackable foods like nuts and i actually gained some weight over the holidays .
a level head is your most useful tool in dealing with them .
i would call it a mistake and i say that having read the papers and taken courses in computer architecture though i work in software .
not considering the security implications of a performance optimization or missing certain security implications while considering it is a mistake .
it 's a pretty understandable one security is hard to get right and this is a remarkably clever side channel but if this outcome had been known during design i expect things would have been designed differently .
definitely agree it 's not a manufacturing defect sorry if that was n't clearer in my original post .
calmed down a bit started slowing down my play a bit and doing slightly better now .
just use the watch as you 'd like it gets pretty great battery life .
a few of my friends also passed it but also know some people who failed and are exmatriculated now .
i try not to think about that negative outcome .

this is pretty deceptive compared to what is actually happening though ... rayleigh scattering is n't the same as being that color ...
in the atmosphere if you look through more and more of it directly like the plastic bags it actually looks red like the sunset which has its light passing through more atmosphere since the blue portion of the spectrum has been scattered out along the way .
the blue that is scattered out from the light passing though the atmosphere up above you during the day is why the sky looks blue from that perspective .
its not that air itself is blue or red air separates the colors so that you see preferentially different colors depending on how you are observing it .

if your cpu supports pcid then the impact even for i/o wo n't be much but for older cpus including sandybridge which do n't support pcid it will be impactful to a noticeable extent for i/o and general syscalls .
newer emulators for intensive platforms probably do a lot of reading and writing .

ceo 's want to side with salesmen yes which is why they fill org charts with people whose job it is to limit the impact that engineers would otherwise have beyond providing the labor .
in my hypothetical universe these people and their adjuncts would not exist and so what would happen is that engineers would end up gaining control over the company rivaling the ceo 's and salesmen 's power .
at least that was my idea behind the hypothetical world .
when the market needs a new product it is up to me to make sure if it is in the realm of the possible
your job is to communicate what is possible back to the salesmen .
if you look at how a strong experienced pm interacts with a strong experienced engineer as opposed to with interns and fresh college grads you will see it clearly .
the pm will be leaning on the engineer for guidance and then essentially serving as that engineer 's representative to the rest of the company .
it 's almost as if the best pm 's behave more like the engineering lead 's chief of staff while the worst inexperienced pm 's behave more like a dotted line manager because that 's what the org chart encourages them to be .
in my ideal world both customers and salesmen would understand engineering
you 're seeing this from he perspective of a traditional manufacturing processes which is modeled after industrial-age factory where the labor is carried out by unskilled workers on an assembly line .
in which case yes if only customers and salesmen were fully versed in engineering right ?
if you want to contribute to it or work against it is a matter of personal values not of your job title .
this is both true and false at the same time .
i can prove it to you why it 's false .
let 's start with your premise about it being a personal value and apply it to a start-up which has n't hired anyone yet .
you just have some investors and some executives and their personal values .
they use their personal values to build out an org chart and fill it with people whose job titles will be to effectively enforce the personal values of the executives who put them there .
my personal approach is to see the salesmen as a necessary evil put myself in the customer 's shoes and see the engineers as the right people to get the job done once they have a clear view of what is required .
necessary '' is a very vague word in this context .
but it takes a huge leap of logic before you can say that this necessity places janitors on the entrepreneurship side of things while the receptionists are on the labor side of things .
if you are talking about the factors of production you have to provide a compelling reason for why you believe that salesmen get to act as entrepreneurs while engineers get to act as labor .
i 'm really just saying do n't look at it like it 's inevitable .
it was n't too long ago that our society was organized around inbred landlords who walked around in velvet bathrobes carrying a golden sceptre and your job would have been to make sure that all the smart capable people were down in the blacksmith shops forging weapons for the army instead of catching malaria sailing up some jungle river in search of the fountain of youth for his highness .
look at the roles of computer scientists in some of the most valuable impactful companies in the world .
this is where the fallacy of traditional industrial-age org structures really starts to fall apart .
why do you need salesmen with project managers telling engineers what to do again ?
is it really because your business would fail you would n't be able to innovate and all your customers would be really angry ?
or is there actually an opportunity cost here and you are snatching mediocrity from the jaws of greatness ?
again do n't get me wrong there are plenty of well-meaning salesmen who truly care about their companies .
a guy who was probably drunk through college and slept with a bunch of women because he 's very pretty and practiced saying the same line over and over again until it worked ?
who has no fucking clue what he is talking about and gets by on pulling shit out of his ass and your business will never rise above that .
but how would you feel if you were an engineer and a project landed on your desk and you find out that the way the deal was really made is that someone gave the customer a blowjob ?
this really happens too i 'm best friends with a sales director at one of the biggest software firms in a pretty important industry who tells me that the difficulties of her job is keeping ambitious sales girls in line because they keep trying to close deals with sex .
is this the sort of thing that you consider a necessary evil to run a business ?
are those the bottle you get at some places that are so thin you may as well be holding a wet plastic bag ?
i feel like some of this is completely true and some of it is connect the dots guess work that could go both ways .
however i dont think this effects the patriots that much .
if kraft thought there was a large issue here and hr might lose bb i doubt he lets mcdaniels talk to other teams .
he keeps josh in his pocket as the successor .
i think everything moves forward pats win a playoff game then have a battle with pittsburgh that goes either way .
they win 12 games next year and we forget this article .

yeah that 's why even watching hgc you can often hear commentator saying which team did better draft .
it does n't mean you can not win with sub-optimal team .
but only if enemy team fails to define your weakness .
draft a team that has no waveclear enemy can win just by creating lane pressure leading to forcing your team spread which leads to bad teamfights .
draft a team that has weak peel enemy can win by diving your squishies .
in low league people fail to use characters to their full potential sure but it only means that they also can not perform in roles lacking in bad draft .
and in high leagues where people can actually utilize character punishing enemy obvious mistakes is even more common .
except she was just as immature if not more in season 6 .
of course i suppose one could attribute that to the fact that they had already committed to a personality for her and could n't exactly do an about face they would have to do it gradually to be believable .
of course they did n't actually do that she did n't show any particular growth until the end of the season and then in season 7 she was largely different .

well you need to cut down your food and drink budget it seems how well can you cook ?
i cut my monthly food budget from around £250 to £100/£150 a month and could have made much less by stopping buying takeaways making my own sandwiches for lunch at work cooking my own meals from scratch each evening make sure you take advantage of the final reduction hour in your supermarkets ask a member of staff you can get really good food for virtually nothing does n't matter if you do n't eat it all that day most food keeps for a few days after sell by i 've had sausages i 've forgotten about that were over a week out and we 're fine and you can always freeze it as well .

both of your examples are from the perspective of the consumer not the supplier .

she had serious unresolved issues and was emotionally unstable .
that plus the fact that she was somewhat immature meant that she often broke down and could n't function well on her own .
it was n't all her fault as she suffered a lot of abuse from her father as a child but i just could n't handle it .
i 'm a very stable grounded person and our personalities clashed constantly .
we would get into fights over the stupidest things and i always felt like she just was n't handling it the way most adults would .
it often felt like i was arguing with a teenage girl .
thankfully as far as break ups go it could have been a lot worse .

she just needs to give it a rest and wait for it to happen otherwise if she keeps asking and bugging me about it when i actually do ask she might think i 'm just asking to shut her up .

on my current stalker run i started out in fm and looted ml and mt .
i was doing fine but relatively meager premium '' loot .
no top-tier clothing in either location but i had made all the heavy-ass animal skin clothes plus the moosehide sack .
only 3 arrows 8 rifle rounds left no firestriker no heavy hammer or hacksaw .
also was torn up by wolves repeatedly in mt especially at the gas station and was down to one 50 sewing kit .
i travel to pv and from there i intend to summit twm to score some good loot for a long survival run .
i get pinned down in the hunting blind by about 4 wolves and i hate to waste ammo getting past .
eventually i kill two with arrows and scare one away the other one chases me all the way to signal hill .
inside are cargo pants snow pants expedition parka rifle 7 rounds of ammo firestriker stim coffee and much more food than normal .
i was cornered by a bear on the way to the farmhouse and critted him with one arrow .
farmhouse had ski gloves hacksaw climbing socks and tons of food .

segwit had multiple reasons for implementation and was n't 100 about block size .
you just keep saying some dogshit about how it is just as centralizing without qualifying that statement and bring up a small block issue .
the part you 're omitting skipping and avoiding is how segwit is centralized in any way .
it has the potential to have larger block sizes obviously but block weighting and witness data in the middle makes weight not size the mitigating factor and essentially becomes a dynamic size allowing for volume scaling .
not a fixed flat block size dictated by mining mafias who want to be able to control their dust spam and ensure full blocks '' and the ability to inflate tx costs by essentially controlling the floor to get into a block .
so yes in theory segwit with pathological miners can be way way larger than current blocks !
but nobody in the world would do that the spam would cease because they could n't profit from it .
they 'd be throwing cash away while not increasing the minimum tx fee to make it into a block .
in short you come across as concern trolling when just stating things in pithy short sentences without any validation or reference .
there are thousands of crap posts like yours that go into no detail and just say things are this way . ''
on one hand you have new users who understand 1 of any of the meat and potatoes posts here sorta/kinda piecing it together but getting this general feeling that segwit bad !
and on the other hand you have verbose posts with detail that can only react to this trolling with this amount of effort .

its not unusual for 2x4 or 2x6 joists to be used when they only need to hold drywall/plaster and insulation .
any finished room floor will have to support the dead and live loads just like any other room in order to be legal and safe .
you need joists that are up to code for the span between support walls so you might have to double yours or install larger ones .

you know that your comment grossly misrepresents what sanders is saying in that video right ?
he asks other man to speak about why in canada under their national health system you can have access for all people and yet per capita it is less expensive than the united states '' .
this is entirely consistent with the point sanders has been making for years that the u.s. spends more per capita than any other country on earth on healthcare but gets worse outcomes .
i mean he literally says in the video that it 's essential to change the funding system and control mechanisms '' to create a sustainable healthcare system .

right now we are in a fun phase of having a team that fits the mold of some of the stronger teams from the past few decades in its infancy .
my one piece of advice i would give you as a 25 year fan in joining our family is that the fan base is very vulnerable right now and we need to come together to support one another in trusting the plan in place .
as the team is in its infancy one must remember that an infant may be prone to mistakes but with the proper guidance and mentoring it is able to avoid developing bad habits none the less .

it 's a relatively new etf so i 'm assuming they only had the one distribution in 2017 set up as a semi-annually dividend and then switched it to a quarterly dividend for 2018 ?
will they be issuing both cash dividends and phantom distributions quarterly moving forward ?
i think that 's more you just widening your scope of what a superstar is to levels that it should n't be .
actually i used to work at range rover/jaguar and there were some cars that every time you put the nozzle in straight like almost every car takes it and it would stop the pump we learned that if we put the nozzle upside down it would n't stop the pump .

however you need to keep this in mind this is not exactly a zero sum game new money is coming in which increases prices .
you 're profiting not just because someone else lost but because new money is coming in driving up the price .
however i think your skepticism should be directed toward all the new dumb money coming in .
an app called goodbudget uses that exact mentality and concept .
it even calls the folders you allocate money to envelopes .
you manually distribute money into envelopes you setup for yourself and you can see where every penny goes as long as you get into the habit of tacking every purchase you make .
the adding transaction part takes less time to fill out than it usually does to swipe your card at a register .
since i do n't use cash for bills and cash spent is n't worth tracking .
only money i can track in my bank statements gets recorded so i know where all my money is going .
also an added benefit that i do n't have to worry about my money being stolen or lost .
i dunno that i 'd trust them with much else to be honest .

honestly my the best tip for a beginner playing xiaoyu is to stop playing xiaoyu .
i tried starting on her because i think she 's awesome but she 's very different from most of the cast because she breaks the rules left and right .
in the beginning you 'll be able to peel some wins off of players with her tricks but you 're gon na hit a wall at green because you do n't have solid fundamentals .
and they 'll be hard to pick up with her especially once you 're addicted to her gimmicks .
i 've since decided to switch to a more standard character learn to play tekken solidly then pick up xiaoyu down the road when i have a better understanding of how she differs from everyone else .

he 's the only one who even noticed or thought to tell me about an abnormality in my eyes my brain keeps remembering it as eye cups '' where it could be a sign of glaucoma in the future .
i checked with a full-on eye doc ca n't spell it and he confirmed the same abnormality but at this current time my eyes are fine .
we need to monitor it every few years to check for any changes since if something is wrong it can be very easily prevented .
tl dr i now know there 's something that might be wrong with my eyes in the future but now i can at least do preventative visits shit .
yes i use dish soap on my linens or carpet when there is a stain that hasnt set too much .
scrub it in let it sit and then rinse off and it cleans pretty well .

update 5 jan 8 beat marty proc another of merfolk 's worst matchups in two games .
i ended game two with two mistbinders and three islandwalk lords and a cursecatcher and a silvergill .
guy gained a bunch of life throughout the match but i spell pierced a proclamation of rebirth and an elspeth .
i 'm considering bringing the third spell pierce back or maybe adding it to the sideboard .
update 4 jan 8 beat mono w enchantments traditionally an abysmal matchup for merfolk .
game one i kept a poor hand and got enchanted to death real quick .
game 2 i just did the fast merfolk thing .
he blind named kumena 's speaker with nevermore but i did n't even have any of those guys .
i got out a cursecatcher a reej then a couple islandwlak lords with a spreading seas .
he finally played phyrexian unlife to try to gain a turn but i blew that thang up .
i 'm including warden for tier 1 and 2 matchups like death 's shadow burn eldrazi tron jeskai uw control jund/junk and i have n't seen any of that on cockatrice yet .
but merfolk mistbinder has definitely made the deck feel more powerful .
update 3 jan 7 beat sultai eternal command cockatrice is the wild west of modern two consecutive matches 4 consecutive games .
infinite removal but he gifted me islandwalk and this deck has too many lords .
silvergills kept the gas flowing cursecatcher kept him off early cryptics .
the only time i drew swift warden i had exactly botanical sanctum x2 and island x1 so perfect mana .
but i top-decked a silvergill and decided to cast that first for value expanding my already decent board .
but mistbinder shows up in what feels like multiples in every game .
did n't see swift warden game 1 thankfully as a 2-of we do n't necessarily expect to see it every game especially not in super-fast matchups where we do n't get to draw a lot of cards .
won with lords and harbingers mistbinder looking good again .
game 3 i won again with lords and harbingers but also a couple of ceremonious rejections and a natural state hnghh .
turn one and passed with no land drop on turn 2 .
i develop a crazy board and they quit turn 3 .
update 1 jan 6 i could n't wait so i downloaded cockatrice and rix.xml and started jamming some games .
four matches four wins devoted company uw control jeskai ascendancy mardu tokens .
with 14 lords in the deck i 've seen 2-3 lords in the first four turns of almost every single game .
all our little dudes get big faster than ever .
against uw control i swung in the early turns for medium chunks of damage eventually getting the opponent down to 6 .
he cast supreme verdict on my three little guys cursecatcher silvergill harbinger i followed up with swift warden on end step for the 2-turn clock .
i also cast an end-step swift warden after opponent tapped out against mardu tokens with a lord out adding a 4/4 body for a huge attack the following turn .
so no 2-for-1 blowouts with swift warden yet but the big body has been doing work !
tiny tiny cards and all passing of priority is text-based aether vial okay ? '' .
also the mardu opponent only had a mountain and a sacred foundry and tried to cast a tiny terminate on my mistbinder .
i had to remind '' him he did n't have black mana .
so i made a post a few days ago with a decklist before rix was fully spoiled .
i was and am very excited about merfolk mistbinder but also mentioned wanting to test kumena .
after witnessing the remainder of the rix spoilers however i 've decided to take a different approach with my testing .
in the disussion thread that was posted earlier in the week all anyone could focus on was the casting cost .
yes double green is a bit of a shock for a group of players accustomed to playing mono u for years and years .
but ug players should not be afraid of this with the addition of merfolk mistbinder on top of kumena 's speaker we already need to build our manabase to have plenty of support for green in the early turns of the game .
between fetches sanctums breeding pools and caverns double green should n't be much of a problem .
of course we also have access to aether vial which does n't care about colors .
so why am i so excited about swift warden ?
in short the card is everything a merfolk deck wants .
we aim to play the tempo game squeezing maximal efficiency out of our cards in the early part of the game .
we want to establish a huge overwhelming board presence extremely quickly while also protecting the board long enough to close out the game .
this is why cards like cursecatcher and harbinger of the tides are so powerful .
cursecatcher pushes back spells like anger of the gods kolaghan 's command and cryptic command an entire turn .
harbinger helps clear the way for our attacks and forces the opponent to pay twice for their creature .
these guys do all this while also synergizing with our lords and beating face .
basically i think swift warden is the next harbinger of the tides .
actually it 's really strong interaction on a really strong stick .
3-drop 1gg we have an incentive to play 3-drops already in the form of merrow reejerey .
and a 19-land manabase can definitely support a handful of 3-drops .
and 3-drops tend to be better top-decks than 2-drops .
if we 're thinking about ticking up an aether vial to 3 it helps to have more than just a couple in the deck .
so in all the fact that swift warden is a 3-drop should not scare anyone off playing it .
while harbinger is semi-rarely cast with flash because the 4-mana commitment is so high the ability to do so adds awesome flexibility .
with swift warden we can flash him in as early as turn 3 .
flash helps us play on the opponent 's end step dodging sorcery-speed spot removal and board wipes .
it also just gives us extra flexibility holding up instant-speed spells like dispel and natural state post-board during the opponent 's turn and casting swift warden on end step if the opponent does n't play any targets .
this is a beefier body than anyone has played in traditional modern merfolk .
combined with flash and lords swift warden can easily surprise block an attacker giving us a 2-for-1 .
'' when swift warden enters the battlefield target merfolk you control gains hexproof until end of turn .
we all know that merfolk is a strong attacking deck but all our creatures get weaker at instant speed if lords are removed in combat .
having counterspell effects on creatures reduces our dependency on defensive spells like spell pierce .
swift warden is basically a counterspell/stifle limited to protecting our creatures stapled to a flash 3/3 merfolk .
we go to attacks and turn all our dudes sideways .
our opponent casts a removal spell possibly with snapcaster on one of our lords which would allow them favorable blocks .
we flash in swift warden protecting the lord countering the removal .
we get in full damage add a 3/3 to the board and blank their removal .
this scenario is a whopping 2-for-1 and could easily win a game .
i predict we 'll want to cast swift warden most often during our combat phase to counter removal .
we have a cursecatcher and an islandwalk lord on the table then play a land and pass on turn three .
our opponent plays their third tron piece and slams karn .
they activate karn 's 3 trying to exile the lord .
we flash in swift warden protecting the lord countering karn 's ability .
this allows us to easily kill the karn next turn with the lord and cursecatcher and hit the opponent for 4 with the warden .
this is effectively a 2-for-1 and is a super clean answer to a 7-drop planeswalker on turn 3 .
we swing with a silvergill after playing an islandwalk lord against an opponent on jeskai holding up 3 mana .
opponent taps out to cast electrolyze targeting the lord .
flash in swift warden protecting the lord countering the electrolyze .
no removal no card drawn full damage dealt in combat new 3/3 on the board .
other more generic examples include flashing in swift warden on the opponent 's end step to help attack planeswalkers while dodging their effects during the opponent 's main phase think both lilianas gideon of the trials ' 1 jace architect 1 etc .
i 've gotten excited to test a list that is big on interaction and aggression merfolk 's two traditional calling cards .
i added a cavern and cut a fetch as a change from my pre-rix list .
cavern is a very powerful land and if i 'm cutting a spell pierce to make room for swift warden it seems to make sense to shift slightly towards creature mana .
i kept 3x kumena 's speaker but decided to bump cursecatchers back up to the full playset in this list .
cursecatcher has always been a great turn one play that slows the opponent down while establishing our clock .
with extra lords in this list i think it makes sense to prioritize cursecatcher 's interaction over speaker 's aggression ie we are aggressive enough already let 's get as many interactive abilities as possible on our dudes .
eliminates our need to play additional creature removal/bounce in the main deck .
an extra four copies of 2cmc anthem-on-a-body makes ug merfolk way more explosive .
a clean replacement for merfolk branchwalker in this list .
while branchwalker is a good card neither of its modes 2/1 draw a land 3/2 scry is close to as good as another 2-drop lord .
mistbinder rewards us for playing a tribal deck branchwalker is just a strong stand-alone creature .
i 've been running 2x reejerey in my pre-rix list and still love the card .
he is a legit combo with harbinger and his tapping ability is a super strong tool both for ramp and for tapping the opponent 's stuff .
i really like 2x reejerey in this list as lords 13 and 14 and as extra interaction .
lets me trim a spell pierce adds interaction to the deck .
i 'm only running 2x in this list because the casting cost is obviously a bit prohibitive .
only 10 more days til we get to play with our new toys on mtgo !
i tried opening an email account at gmx and for some reason i could not get it to open after the first time .
i had signed up my davor account through that particular email address .
i now have a new email address and would like to know how to change it or request to change it on the davor website .
as of now i can not get into my account on davor .
pretty frustrated with a 10,000 loan out and a bit of staking as well any help would be appreciated .
i have n't got ps but i fired up comrades today and it worked .
i 'm guessing it is just an offline version with ai instead of other gamers ?
could someone please explain if that 's the case and what the differences are .
i 'm hoping it has n't just signed me up to ps automatically lol !
i 'm very new to this just got into crypto 2 weeks ago .
i bought some ltc when it was around 270ish canadian and it 's now obviously a little higher .
i 'm looking to try some 'experimental ' trades with small amounts just to see that i have what it takes '' lol .
just to get the process down and understand how quadrigacx works .
one thing i ca n't find is there a fee for exchanging ltc to btc and vice versa ? .
i 've only seen fees of 0.5 on fiat exchange and 0.2 on eth/btc .
i get the gist of it and really want to try with a small marginal for me amount that i would n't miss if i eff 'd it up .
i keep reading sell in the green buy in the red '' but like sell to fiat ?
like how do i consider everything and make the 'best ' decision ?
i know it 's hella complicated and not a simple binary 'yes/no trade now ' ... but like i just want to get to the root of this haha .
like bear/bull runs i 'm reading up on too but i still feel like most people on r/litecoin and r/litecoinmarkets are kind of talking over my head/level at this point .

i see posts about protein that are either make sure to get your protein ! or careful of too much protein !
my goal is 76g of protein and i 've eaten 129g today .
i know i need to kcko but for future reference is there a guideline ?
i made some flipping amazing alfredo zucchini noodles for dinner .
with the hwc butter cheese i went over on my fat by 100 grams .
i am finishing the night at 19 grams of carbs a tad short on protein .
i have read others say they only track carbs do n't worry about the fat proteins .
i love this keto-lifestyle some days i go over oh well keep moving improving .
a few days ago everything was fine but now out of the blue possibly after a router crash my server browser refuses to find some specific servers that are online other servers i can find work fine attempting to join through friends in steam brings up the view game info box without any info in it except that the server is n't responding and connecting through connect ip just gives me the connection failed after 6 attempts .
i 've so far tried uninstalling gmod and steam verifying the caches resetting my computer steam and router firewall settings and allowing it through firewalls some steam settings like opting into the beta and setting the in-game server browser max pings option to the lowest possible .
i am also 100 certain i am not banned from any of the servers i 've been trying to connect to .
if anyone has any idea what fix i should try next then that would be great !

has anyone ever had to do a proveit test for a job in supply chain ?
so this is interesting ... today on a website for contractor opportunities the blm posted a request for the following work
presidential proclamation 9682 modified the grand staircase escalante national monument gsenm and creating three separate units grand staircase kaiparowits and escalante canyons .
the blm intends to prepare a resource management plan rmp for each unit and fourth rmp for federal lands previously included in the gsenm that are excluded from the boundaries .
this fourth rmp will be called the kanab field office-escalante area resource management plan . ''
the blm will prepare a single environmental impact statement to satisfy the nepa requirements for these rmps .
preparation of the kanab field office-escalante area rmp will involve development of a mineral potential report coal suitability analysis oil and gas reasonably foreseeable development scenario and acec evaluations .
so minerals coal and oil/gas extraction is what ryan zinke must have meant when he said it is my responsibility to ensure that these lands are used 'for the benefit and enjoyment of the people .
preparation of a rmp does not mean that they 're going to start drilling .
it simply means that they 're seeing if it 's worth it .
it 's a long road from request for proposal '' to mining for coal '' but for anyone against this this is where you 'll be able to voice your concerns .
as part of the nepa requirements mentioned above there will be a public comment period once the report is written and made public .
this report can take months or even years but it is a law that they let the public review and comment on it .
there are also five public meetings mentioned in the scope but since its up to the contractor to hold the meetings there is no information other than the meetings will be in utah ... .just a heads up .
the poor blm i ca n't image that they want any of this ...
tldr the government requests reports on the potential for minerals coal and oil/gas extraction on lands formerly protected as the grand staircase escalante national monument .
so far the only things i can do with them is build the mats for the iron man costume which i know i wo n't end up with enough for so what exactly are these things good for and why should i bother
i do n't have any skills and i do n't have te brains to do business .
my only strong point is that i 'm undefeatable .
the other guy took a long time to join .
just picked up a new galaxy s8 and have been trying to check out vr stuff however everything i try is just crazily spinning and rolling out of control !
i 've tried doing the whole 0 thing and recalibrating with apps but nothing seems to work !
it 's a rock song all male group i think it was a setup of i think bass lead vocals drums and maybe a keyboard it was n't in english i think maybe korean or german .
the music video was on youtube somewhere between 2005-2010 .
the video is just the band playing in maybe a white/glass room and near the end like 3 giant white robots slowly walk out they looked kind of like a robosapien .
i think the video ends with the robots walking toward the band but i only have vague memories of it and ca n't remember anything about the song lyrics except that they were playing heavyish rock and maybe some kind of electronic .
edit also i 'm pretty sure the band and the songs name are both in a different language .
we all know now about what those 19 and below events well this started on the ford gt event where players who are under level 20 were instead given the dodge charger r/t instead later this continued on the pagani zonda when the nissan 370z fastlane event was later added as a replacement event for under 20 users now fm decided that the z34 event will resume again for users who are under level 20 during the venom and koenigsegg events .
here 's a theory for jt 's new single as the lead in for ‘man of the woods '
drawing from both the video and song for clues i think justin is throwing us a curveball with what will ultimately be an intro to a much different album than we 've heard from him before .
here jt is addressing his fans particularly those who love pop hits and/or the bon iver indie/folk aficionados .
a prediction of the confused reaction by both of the groups above that we saw earlier this week when the motw trailer was released .
pop enthusiasts think his new direction might be too much and music snobs predict it wo n't be enough .
it 's hard to say when he lost it as jt is arguably as popular as ever .
but one might speculate that 2016 's kid friendly smash hit ca n't stop the feeling might have bothered him a bit .
what i mean to say if you 're jt it might get under your skin that the song you wrote for the movie trolls is your most successful song to date .
i think jt is saying here that he 's about to right that ship .
he 's telling his fans to lap it up .
he 's going to push it to the brink of your comfort zone .
jt the inventor is in the future 2028 presenting a new version of himself .
one that mimics his movements and earns adulation for his performance .
the robot symbolizes what will happen to jt if he keeps making music for the sake of popularity .
he 'll keep pushing limits on the same formula and eventually the synthetic version he creates will replace the real him .
another nod that he 's breaking the third wall and letting you in on the formula .
tim starts working in heavy breathing gnarly breaks and eerie builds .
in the video the robot is pushing the comfort zones of the audience and jt is watching and smiling .
the 2028 jt in the video represents the current point in his career .
the video the song its placement as the first track on the album it 's all a build up to a tipping point .
the future fans are left cheering for the simulation while in the song a voice is calling to him .
he can continue to reign as the president of pop .
or he can blow the whole thing out of the water with a totally different kind of album .

i traded some of my xrp when it was over 3 for eth .
how can i figure out what the usd price of eth was at the time i traded ?
bch has been moving sideways these past few months but will be taking off soon .
in the meantime i 've been making massive gains with tron trx .
i have an inside source that got me in at 0.03 trx just before liftoff and i 've been absolutely crushing .
that is why i 've been mia from this forum for a while .
many people think that tron has peaked and are cashing out but those are just idiots you with weak hands folding bye bye cucks !
tron is poised to take off to another dimension !
alibaba is obviously in tron 's pocket this is no surprise .
plus alibaba is traded on nyse not nasdaq morons .
justin 's news tonight was groundbreaking as he announced that there are 5 nasdaq partners .
we know that justin has alibaba in his pocket but now we know that he has 5 huge nasdaq companies to add to the list as well .
i have a very reliable source that is also a tron developer .
in the source code for tron you can see who the 5 partners are already .
iac owner of sites like vimeo and home advisor as well as purchasing sites like angie 's list .
zynga a social-gaming app responsible for games like farmville and words with friends .
groupon an e-commerce network connecting consumers with local merchants .
match group the parent company of dating and social sites like match and tinder .
microsoft the software giant acquired business networking site linkedin in 2016 .
very active in the crypto sphere as well as social media .
it 's not even a fair comparison as the gains that the will see from centralized cucks like ripple will pale in comparison .
that jew cuck zuck is probably loosing sleep because he already knows what 's going to happen !
tron is poised to reach 3.50 in q2 2018 easy .
my german programmer contact at coinbase nikolai dyberstein contacted me directly through comstat when he was at 80,000 elevation because he had to give me additional breaking news he disclosed to me that coinbase is already discussing adding tron due to it 's large market share .
phone updated over night and now calling does n't work .
attempting to make or receive a call make my phone crash and restart .
even tried using snapchat calling and that also crashed .
long-winded question sparked by a discussion with a friend .
the immediacy of television heightened the impact of non-violent protest in the 20th century .
i 'm wondering to what extent individuals with limited mobility those using crutches wheelchairs etc .
volunteered to be arrested for their cause in the hopes of generating even worse bad press when protesters were arrested .
for example several documentaries/films about the vietnam war protests features marches with a vanguard of veterans wounded in action .
was this a deliberate strategy that emerged over time ?
did other protest movements adopt similar tactics to maximize the negative impact of arrests ?
looking for a film that i saw in french class about ten years ago .
i think the parents and their little boy end up in a camp .
i remember that the one of the parents gets on an amplifier in a german officer 's office and plays a song that means a lot to the other parent letting them know they are alive .
hey there i am jack and i am a 21 year old male from england .
i am slim have dirty blonde hair dark blue eyes and i am relatively fit .
i am 6ft tall and my cock is just less than 7 inches when fully hard .
i need a woman who can properly indulge me in my filthy ways and who would have just as much fun doing it as i do ... afterall happy partners leads to happy play right ?
i absolutely love older more mature ladies as there is something about you women that just drives me crazy .
your experience and 'talent ' is uncomparable to a girl my own age .
the majority are far too straight and boring to tickle my fancy .
you know just what you want and how to get it and by god i love that about you ...
as i mentioned i can be a naughty boy so i am in need of a woman who does n't mind having a young hard cock slapped across her face before taking it as far as she can down her throat .
a woman who is n't scared to grind her ass against my crotch until i blow in my pants whilst we are out and about either on a bus in a taxi at a resteraunt in a crowded place where we are all squashed in next to eachother ...
but at the same time a woman who knows when i am getting too ahead of myself and has no problem with giving me a spanking or making me do whatever she wants and taking control when i need to be taught a lesson ...
so if you need a young sex crazed filthy boytoy in your life then you will not be making a mistake by dropping me a message ...
i bet you 're already wet thinking about it ... .
lots of cum women who love to suck cock dirty talk large breasts age gaps a nice big round and bubbly ass public play being dominated face sitting watersports cucking incest risky sex spanking and also partners who are very dirty and adventurous !
obviously you do n't need to like everything i do so if you see something you do n't like then please do n't make that stop you from reaching out to me ...
i ca n't wait to play with you filthy ladies .
despite it saying 100 of 100 remaining on the limits screen and buy 1,000 of digital currency with this payment method '' to increase the limit it will only let me buy 5 worth when i go to actually buy something .

i have been reading the posts from all the new folks these last few days and god i just want to hug you all and let you know it really does get better and easier as time goes on .
early sobriety for me was an emotional roller coaster .
i felt all the feelings questioned my sanity fought off unbelievable cravings and debated changing jobs .
that was just in the first hour i was awake .
my point is that with time and a program of recovery my life has improved exponentially .
im not going to sit here and list off all the good things in my life but the biggest one i have is actual honest to goodness serenity .
i have been right where a lot of you are and i am here to say a better life exists and is waiting for you it just takes time and effort to get it .
if you feel like you 've been held back by something your whole life that you may just be missing the boat too many times or that your mind is constantly plagued by thoughts of worlds that are n't real stop playing .
i fell in love with the music the story the characters i was hooked .
but now as a 29 year old with not much to show for it i 've realized my addiction .
i 'm going snowboarding next week for the first time ever and i feel more social and have more things to talk about .
you can do it and see how good it feels .
i am loving the support of those choosing to be in my life and the encouragement i receive everywhere in between !
i am loving the good vibes the positive energy and the inspiration affecting me for better moments !
i am doing what i can in a loving direction ...
i could go on ... ... .pleeeeez show some patience and pleeeez do not feel entitled to anything on this game and your life will be happier 😃
i get frustrated too but there are larger problems in our world vs. not knowing or feeling ripped off in a football mobile game peace xx
she 's been healthy all her life .. she is currently 69 .
she use to complain about stomach pain but never thought much of it .
two weeks ago she started to have severe itchy skin and became soo yellow .
we took her to the hospital and they found a mass on her pancreas .
they gave her a stent to help but they have to go in and do it again so make sure it 's working and so they can look further in .
they say she definitely needs surgery and chemo after .
my family is trying to be positive but it hurts to see her the way she is .
she 's been suffering with the itching so if anybody has any tips on that .
we just been giving her cold compress and cortizone cream .
after being in the hospital for a week she 's finally home .
i 'm happy she can do her normal activities and have a better mood but when i look at her the jaundice just reminds me of what she 's going through '
hi guys i 'm just interested to find out whether it 's possible to sync too kodi setups the layout the channels the shortcuts everything that someone has for it to be reproduced on the other
the only reason i ask is because i want to make sure that i only need to change one setup but then the other setup as reflected on the other kodi box .
as an example i 've got two kodi boxes setup in my mother 's place one i 've got access to remotely to manage but the second one i ca n't so what i 'd like to do as i 'd like to be able to make whatever modifications i like on one and for those to be synced across to the other .
at the end of the day it would just be ui changes shows that i add to the homescreen etc .

post your flair requests in the comment area below and expect lengthy delays until we can get to everyone .
we 've had proposals to do a coin giveaway or a belated secret santa-style exchange .
i think it could be fun for everyone but i 'd really like to see some coins going to young collectors and other people just getting started in the hobby but who do n't have the ability to buy a lot of coins .
we the moderation team can try to get the ball rolling but like you most of us are pretty busy with our own lives .
the last time someone brought up doing an exchange two or three years ago there was a lot of excitement and comments but no follow-through on the parts of people who said that they wanted to participate .
please feel free to post your thoughts and ideas of how we can celebrate this big milepost .
ps just for giggles here is what r/coins used to look like
https web.archive.org/web/20120130021601/http www.reddit.com:80/r/coins this is from awhile after i became a moderator here
i followed directions to unlock the bootloader of my oneplus 5t and everything went well but after replugging the phone to the computer and going back in bootloader mode to flash a recovery my computer suddenly does n't see my device .
what 's even more frustrating is when i do adb devices '' while my phone is on in normal mode aka just powered on into home screen adb lists my device .
but when i go into bootloader mode and do adb devices '' it 's no longer listed on the command prompt .
i have the challenge play 7 matches and the challenge can not be completed by playing the new special event .
i have another challenge play 3 special event matches and this one can be completed .
i 'm having a really hard time getting anything on upwork .
i 'm new to the site but not to my industry .
i 've put out about 30 proposals since late november and only managed to get one 10 job .
another job kept repeatedly inviting me to apply and then would n't return my messages another job posted their budget i submitted a proposal and then they told me i was too expensive .
i told them i could work for less and they did n't reply ...
i 'm unable to get my money out since it 's below the upwork minimum withdrawal balance so i 'm basically sitting here totally broke unable to even get my 10 .
does anyone know tips or tricks to try to land jobs ?
i 'll take anything at this point i am getting desperate .
where can i find items like the supreme dog bowl and more ?
the following post by ih8pstat is being replicated because some comments within the post but not the post itself have been openly https snew.github.io/r/cryptocurrency/about/log removed .
the original post can be found in censored form at this link
if you do n't know what it is here are some stats
aptoide is one of the largest and roid app stores with over 4 billion downloads .
so the coin is perfectly positioned to change the mobile app industry .
mobile advertising in 2017 had far more growth than any other form .
in addition in-app purchases have revolutionized the gaming industry making billions in profit .
appc is poised perfectly to meet those needs and owns the distribution center with a billion user product already .
my store still has 4 vacuum sealers for sale and there 's so much merchandise from christmas i always wonder if next week 's finds will fit .
any idea how long the stores go before discounting unsold merchandise like this ?
i do n't understand why for example they made the jakku map take place during a fo-resistance conflict when it should 've been the original battle of jakku like it was in the first battlefront .
or why they randomly set the map for endor during a nighttime battle that was n't even in the movies and was n't part of the main battle of endor .
it does n't make sense since most people like me play these games to play out the main battles that are actually seen in the movies .
so capslock on and let 's get bitching ! !
a person i follow on instagram posted a clip of a music video .
it featured a group of girls rollerblading while dance music played in the background .
i asked her what the song is called and several hours later the post was deleted from her insta !
she wan na ride thru on a skateboard i said okay all day broad i 'll hit that ... like a-rod okay let 's go just play ball '' .
those lyrics just repeat over and over and over during the 45 second clip .
if given the opportunity for 99.9 pure crystal thumprint would you do it ?
all relative responsibilities taken care for while you recover for 3 weeks like rent and changing your diaper for you would you actually do it ?
hey guys so i was looking online and came across a motobecane 7 for fairly cheap and i was wondering if they 're decent for a first moped ?
if any of you have ridden one or have any experience it 'd be great to hear about it .
need info on traveling to revelstoke for the first time ?
for new and experienced snowboarders with any questions at all about snowboarding including gear learning what to wear where to go what terminplogy is rad etc .
please ask questions in this thread and let the r/snowboarding community help out .
this is meant as a judgement-free and welcoming environment for noobs to ask any kind of question related to snowboarding no matter how dumb it may seem .
i agree with all the changes but applying them is going to take hours .
i thought there might be a fix flag but there is n't .
there 's a refactor flag that prints the fixed file to stdout .
it 's been 45 days now and it was well worth it .
i stopped by to see my badge and remember how many days it 's been so i figured i would make a post .
my lungs still do n't really feel fully functional and i feel like i have a constant head-cold .
while the cravings and all that are mostly gone the ill health remains .
from this point after 45 days it 's obvious that it was worth it that smoking was a mistake to begin with .
when i was a smoker i was hesitant to quit thinking i 'd miss it that i would need it and so on ... just the typical smoker reasoning .
well now it 's been 45 days and it 's obvious that it was well worth it and that i should never smoke again unless i really want to get stuck again in a pit of misery with little hope of escape .
so i know a lot of 40k fans like to boast about the scale of the 40k universe and how every ship runs on millions of indentured slaves '' .
for example an ultramarines battle-barge a chapter with one of the largest amount of human staff was stated to have a crew size of only 20,000 despite being 5-10 km long and most of its systems were automated .
for these la light attack farmers/afkers are such a gold .
here is a video my friend and i made of it really quickly in sandbox mode .
an enemy stitches was able to do it to us in a game as well .
i have n't tested on every map but we can confirm it happens on tomb and cursed hollow .
i know for a fact this behavior was not always in the game and i do n't remember the change being in the patch notes
does not appear to be a change noted in the patchnotes so i will say this is definitely a bug
title pretty much says it all and this is extremely frustrating .
essentially i import my audacity audio in to premiere and my gameplay/facecam footage in to premiere as well i just record my facecam and gameplay as one rather than separate .
i begin by syncing the audio like normal 3-2-1 clap and everything starts of peachy .
however as time goes on the audio slowly goes out of sync with the video .
it 's incredibly infuriating and i troubleshot for over 3 hours trying to fix it and the internet could not help .
tried handbreak for constant framerate or whatever no fix .
i am looking into purchasing multiple 4k monitors with a vesa desk mount most likely one that clamps into the desk .
i do not have a set price range but 700 per monitor and 200 for the vesa mount but i am open to anything
this is for productivity and not intended for gaming .
current setup 980ti i7-4770k with a 27 '' 1080p monitor
i am currently looking at getting 2 40 '' 4k aoc c4008vu8 http us.aoc.com/product_feature.php ? id=84 .
ideally with a mount i would go for a setup up using this quad vesa mount https www.amazon.com/vivo-monitor-heavy-screens-stand-v004y/dp/b01e6448ks/ref=sr_1_5 ? s=office-products ie=utf8 qid=1515227243 sr=1-5 keywords=quad+vesa+mount and have the two aoc on either end and my current monitor up top .
this doesnt seem possible with what i have found due to the weight 26.12lb
i recently found this vesa mount https www.amazon.com/deluxe-monitor-desktop-supports-002-0019/dp/b006jg7g2e ? ie=utf8 psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 and it supports 26lbs which seems as though it may be enough i am just making the assumption of this number being below max weight this could be me just being completely ignorant
i am looking for a strong vesa mount thats not over priced imo that can hold upwards of 30lbs .
i have not been able to find any vesa stands for monitors over 32 '' .
also any recomendations on 4k monitors above 32 '' .
an entire fucking thread full of manlet apology here in r/drama
one of the most disgusting things i had to read in a while
short men '' have rightfully belonged to the same category women have for centuries .
using my new asset you can convert your level made with objects/tiles into a level that can be destroyed using circles rectangles triangles and even sprites ! .
note that the objects/tiles you convert will be removed from the game so any code in those objects will not run .
if you use this asset please give me your feedback so that i can make it better !
this game will never be as fun as tf2 will never have the soul tf2 had .
it will always be an imitation a bastard frankenstein monster of esports and stolen concepts fap bait factory made waifus obvious saturated stereotypes and tropes .
i can accept that its what we wanted and what we deserved for jumping ship .
tho i know no matter how much they posture and put on a mask .
blizzard made this game for one thing and its green .
its total soulless joyless trash and belongs in the trash .
as soon as i realized it was n't tf2 it was like a veil lifted to how bad this game is .
it changed video games its an industry not an art .
tf2 was art tf2 had soul it had expression and joy .
overwatch can imitate it but it will never have what we touched on high tower and upward .
i just realised that i have n't played this map for literally hundreds of matches .
has it been removed or does it just not show up in tier 6 matchmaking ?
ever since i was a kid i 've noticed that my feet lean forward while laying down .
i always thought the depictions of people sleeping with their toes towards the ceiling was a joke or something .
even still when i lay on my back my feet point down like a ballerina .
when i try to bring my feet up straight i feel a lot of pressure at my ankles and toes .
as a kid i always ran very slowly tip toeing like trying to run without making any noise and running was always very labored .
i also walked up stairs awkwardly putting weight on one foot but in high school i forced myself to walk upstairs correctly and now usually do it normally .
when barefoot i walk in tiptoe a lot of the time .
however my feet feel fine when standing flat on the ground .
i remember telling my parents and doctor but they did not take it very seriously .
i went to physical therapy a few times but i felt like they did n't believe me or that i was being dramatic .
i will be going there tomorrow on the motorcycle and am wondering if the roads are clear of snow .
or perhaps link to some webcams that show the roads and not just the slopes
i have many games on my backlog ranging from indies platformers and rpg 's and like everyone else many more that i would love to play .
i ca n't organize my gaming time so i find myself jumping between titles in the short time that i have .
i do n't think this is a good practice because i end up not paying the deserved attention to any of them !
any tips in how to help me having a quality gaming time ?
do you think that finishing shorter games indies and platforms before long ones like most of the rpg 's is a good option or is better to play the ones i like the most even if they are longer ?
edit thanks guys there 's a lot of great methods that i 'm gon na try !
i 'm going to keep this brief and to the point daybreak .
you 've finally nailed it it feels like the old ar with some balance .
add the update to the live servers because i 'm ready to put another 700 hours into the game .
now as for the ak i feel like it has too much vertical recoil and should be put in line to the ar 's recoil just like before in order to give it a two tapping feel to it .
... because she just refused to acknowledge it the first couple of times .
i found this very interesting to listen to because it 's always intriguing to realize how similar our parents generations are no matter what part of the world you happen to be from .
the narrative of wanting your child to be normal in the context of whatever society you grew up in exists in so many parts of the world and is such an underlying part of why sexuality is such a difficult topic to bring up in many places .
i personally love the games and recently found that they do novels too .

i ca n't remember much of the specifics so i 'll provide what i can remember or think i remember .
i think it was a paperback with a view over a city on the cover maybe a big tower in the foreground .
it was set in a city which was ruled by powerful families named after the metal they were in charge of producing and the main character was the bastard son of one of these families argent/silver i think it was and he was a thief maybe .
for some reason he has to collect these mystic doodads and i think one of them gets embedded into his heart .
once he has all of them then he turns into a flying angel man that if i recall correctly was called a daeva spelling ?
i seem to remember a female love interest nothing about her just that there was one .
i think there were scenes in his family home a forest or garden/greenhouse and sewers beneath the city .
i ca n't remember exactly what happens in them but i think that 's where at least one of the doodads were .
does anyone have a problem of their war enemy clan makes cw a draw without our approval ?
this shit has been going for the 4th time already .
we did not accept to draw it just happens over and over again .
hello i want to ask you guys whats your opinion on such a system ?
in my opinion it would be helpfull cause often mybtabjs simply arent made for certain maps and so on ill get killed and killed and killed i want a systen which shows you how much people play rn on certain maps and you can select one where you would like to join .
has anyone ever gotten a red card from giving away a penalty ?
personally i get pissed when i do n't get red on a obvious foul .
someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit

i cut myself on glass and although fluent in spanish no one could give me alcohol to clean it though they offered me rum many times .
when i came back to the states my doctor was like please do n't ever take random medicine from and stranger in a foreign country every again
i worked a shit job at the most dirty dysfunctional company i had ever encountered .
please tell me that these red flags i see are me being paranoid.
happy i got the switch regional but i do enjoy having a far fetched that sucks as the only one i found after a week in hong kong .
so i hope they do n't do it super often
most doctors about their patients they see them as a subject of study imo not that there is anything wrong with being professional and keeping sentiments away but it really bugs me sometimes that they could treat patients the same way as a mechanic treats the vehicles in his garage
ok i will pretend i am akm for a minute .
ideally i would want an owl team as they are at the pinnacle of ow esports .
i would want a western team as i do n't speak korean
i would want a team where i would be the main soldier/pharah player and not a sub .
i would like a decent shot at winning owl .
i would be interested in dallas fuel first and foremost .
i am a better soldier than harryhook and taimou .
i have more experience playing pharah on lan than seagull and my mccree/widow is more consistent than taimou not better but more consistent also i could be the teams 2 tracer player if effect ever got ill or deported by trump etc etc .
despite some of the envyus vs rogue flame wars i came out of it relevantly clean and there is no hard feelings either way .
ok it was nice to pretend i am a good overwatch player even if just for a paragraph or so .
but i think there would be a spot for him with the boys in blue .
i think he fits into that roster nicely and would certainly be the main soldier player there if not other heroes too .
he is probably the best soldier in the west apart from dafran .
asians take up a good percentage of america it 's job market and school system performing at the top of the class and also having a high rate in the job industry .
it 's america racism exist just predominantly with blacks and latinos .
just from experience as a mixed black hispanic and chinese american .
the racism i received for being chinese was minimal compared to the racism i recieved being black .
they have their good and they have their bad .
people paint their pictures and believe it 's truth when it 's nothing but a mix of envy and spite .
vue has a warning that says not to use with aluminum parts .

love that place and always go there when i 'm on that side of the cities .
i 'm kinda glad i do n't live that close though because i would be broke if i did
i suspect more to do with anti social behaviour than actually homelessness hate .
litter glass car parties and burnouts are the more likely reasons .
background in council stuff and security that did the council stuff like locking the parks up .
tbh i 'm surprised that it 's a new thing for bc park.
i made some bad financial decisions when i was a student .
i 'm trying remedy that now and i 've only been working a year .
with my income i 'm sure my debt picture will look much different three years from now .
i think the rv loan is a solid choice all things considered .
it will solve several problems for us increase cash flow and reduce expenses .
it 's either that or rent in the new city .
we did find a different rv then the one we posted about this one is 6k cheaper so about 15k all in with delivery .
in regard to rv expenses we are n't buying something with a motor in it it is a travel trailer .
and it will be parked all the time i 'm optimistic that repair costs will be pretty much nonexistent at least for now .
he has done well thus far and will put up a good fight you watch .
the asus 561 which is due to come out soon apparently also has a 1050 .
i would be seldomly playing games and if so first person shooter style games..
when i lowered mine i dropped it below where i wanted to end up went and dm 'd for like 45 min then raised it up to where i wanted and dm 'd for another 45 min .
i do n't believe you can sell southwest gift cards on cardpool .
i loved the music played in this episode the flameos were getting it
i thought about the deep well plates and it definitely is an option .
but i was hoping i would n't have to do ph-chlr extractions as they are a huge pain in the ass and all of the hazardous chemicals are annoying to dispose of to say the least .
if push comes to shove this may be the solution .
i 'm genuinely curious how humane '' it would be to use a crude axe/rock/arrow/spear like our ancestors did for thousands of years .
they certainly depended on wild game and that was the only way to take it .
even a musket could never drop an elk as effectively as that shot that we just witnessed .
i am not from a region which does n't have yearly 35c peaks winters .
i was born here my father as well mother from belgium etc .
just stay alive a bit longer get used to it like we have been doing for thousands of years and move on with life .
with mercy being one of my mains her upcoming nerf makes my insides die a little .
you 'll have to skip down to 6 to hear it .
i 'm not a big guy about 5'7 '' 170 and i can only think of 4 women at my workplace who would give me a hard time out of about 300 employees .
men and women are built differently and even 2 on 1 it would be a bloodbath .
yuasa and the writing team did a good job .
direction certaintly was n't the problem from what i 've heard about the source material and read about the characters and the storyline on the wiki it 's a great adaptation but i think these problems translated over from the original manga .
i see there was n't much they could do really without breaking the story really especially the last 4 1/2 episodes because that 's really where everything pretty much falls apart
your gifs got me through my bs in physics thank you !

at first i read it brewing appliance '' which i thought was kinda harsh but true for baristas and baristers .
you 're literally just pulling shit out of your ass now .
i realize i made a mistake by saying my store does n't do the 30 day shit and rectified it by saying by my understanding we do n't .
i said to my knowledge as far as i know as far as anyone has told me as far as i have been taught i did not know about the 30 day policy .
that does n't mean my store leader does n't know .
that does n't mean our one other sga does n't know .
it does n't even mean other gas dont know .
it doens't mean our store is lying to our customers .
it does n't mean we are single handedly fucking over the rest of the company it means i one sga single employee was unaware of policy .
and ignorance that could 've easily been mended by a quick hey yeah the 30 day thing is actually a company policy . ''
in most western countries i would expect it to be something like this
atleast a few other social connections particularly to the opposite gender .
but it 's really more about the individual here .
if you do n't feel like you 're living a normal life then you 're probably not .
there 's a lot of wiggle room here it 's like trying to define what a 'game ' is it 's easier to define what is n't than what it is .
euron should have had more scenes and appeared earlier in the show like s5 .
there 's not enough of him to build up to a main villain
i would think it takes more than a couple days .
vyvanse wont really affect it in any other way in that maybe you would get more anxiety but that 's probably it .
i 'm honestly shocked by the amount of people using that shit these days .
i also take bitcoin so eh maybe .25 bitcoin per chinchilla ? ?
my girlfriend did the same thing with her colleagues ' fantasy football team except she put michael the dog killer '' vick on her team and also she lost .

carry a broken ass team to game 7 against one of the best teams ever
bruh they won a game because rondo miraculously scored 44 .
they won the very same game you clipped and pp was n't even their leading scorer !
he had 19/4/2 on 31.6 shooting while kg had 26/11 on 55 shooting .
in that series he was the celtics third leading scorer behind rondo and kg and he shot 34.4 from the field .
at least in rogue one there was the dancing twi'lek hologram
yea i was planning on doing something with those eventually .
recently i 've freezing my ass off walking ten blocks to the subway station .

i love winter too but this is just too much
i know there 's been a lot of misinformation on this issue but for the record fuck the rich populism '' is identity politics .
the only difference is that it 's an identity with which you happen to identify .
after hunting down the original clip i think that 's a somewhat misleading headline .
it was n't particularly funny i think boogie is supposed to be 'doing a character ' which means he 's only being ironically obnoxious and being ironically obnoxious is funny somehow fuck me i do n't know but the gist of the joke is pretty clearly hey remember that logan paul thing ?
the headline on the other hand implies some sort of hypocrisy like boogie criticized logan paul and then turned around and started mocking suicide victims and that 's not what happened .
he mocked logan paul for filming a dead body and separately he has a gratingly bad sense of humor .
it 'd be like any joke whose punchline winds up being something like too old for roy moore . ''
it 's a joke about pedophilia sure but the joke is at the expense of the victimizer and not the victim .
or a joke about logan paul following around insert hollywood asshat revealed to be a sexual predator here hoping to catch the dead body of asshat 's career on film .
you could write jokes around those ideas and some of them would be funny and they are n't really wrong or even edgy .
they reference a shitty thing make people remember that shitty thing and make fun of it for being shitty .
boogie 's is n't very good as humor or as commentary because it 's just logan paul filmed a dead body !
but it 's still not the same kind of beast as haha suicide am i right guys ?
not sure how it causes s0 shit when you 're going 1 just for a rum in an s0 deck and ns effect is n't useful .
materials are unstated because they 're generic so the deck is n't hard locked while every abuses scapegoat and shit .
i work as a lvn there are a lot of rn opportunities in sd .

happened a lot to me in ffa last month .
i was the highest rank in almost every lobby i was in .
then i realized these xmas noobs actually have thumbs .
i used to play tg myself about a year ago so it might be different but what i remember is that harvesters ca n't harm people with punches and instead do stamina damage but can break through glass slowly in four to five hits .
they usually die to three or four laser or bullet hits .
juggernauts on the other hand were basically hulks who shrugged off laser fire .
also all the albums are great except tlop which should be
i bought the first one for like 15 bucks .
and thought it was an alright read worth the money spent .
it was a hicks/newt story though they changed the names .
yeah they put caramel on the rim and dip it in cinnamon sugar .
i feel the same i havent loved ahs since asylum and roanoke fucking sold me .
just all-around solid horror i binged the entire season in one day
clearly you 've never faced a player who has specced into anti-armor attacks .
a crossguard to is a pretty reasonable approximation of a warhammer .
lol you show the work order and the cops let you go .
brad pitt when he was younger in thelma and louise .
by that logic there 's no more logic so stop now .
my doctor confirmed it so it 's not like i 'm just bad at fapping or sex or anything .
my boyfriend is asexual but we are best friends and both want kids so we get along pretty well .
the multi-pill ones are much smaller than most prenatals i 've had .
watching the gif personally ruined it for me as i 've never noticed it before watching the gif posted c

fuckin panic sellers ca n't hold on when it reaches a buck .
i think this coin will never surpass a buck if you retards keep selling ... .
lebron to sac in the old school royals jerseys .
first of all let me just say that getting through the christmas season in the toy department is not a small feat especially being a new department manager .
knowing what i know about you i 'm sure you 've learned a lot from the experience and are already making plans to do things a little differently and a little better next year .
i got into the retail game when i was very young .
when i worked at toys r '' us it was okay because pretty much all of us were in our early 20 's .
at walmart it was a very different story because there was a much more diverse range of associate ages .
even though walmart is a champion of diversity you will encounter associates who make judgments about you based on your gender or skin color or age .
it 's not fair but it 's an unfortunate reality .
if you work hard and prove yourself then the managers who know what a good associate you are wo n't care how many years you 've been on this planet .
something to keep in mind is that during christmas nobody was really on process .
can you imagine trying to do slow methodical section work when you had customers asking about fingerlings and lol dolls every 30 seconds ?
now that it 's january it 's time to get back into your routines .
my store manager toured with me too and he mentioned things like my topstock being a disaster and all the missing labels i had .
your management team is just letting you know what the expectations are going forward .
regarding the coaching you mentioned my advice is to compartmentalize your work into two categories stuff they want done and stuff you want done .
stuff they want done encompasses things like price changes mods section work capping your bins and whatever management asks you to do .
it 's non-negotiable so you get it out of the way first .
if you have time left over though then that 's when you get to work on stuff you want done .
this is when you get to build features or organize your flex or mark down your clearance or whatever you feel needs to be done .
related to that some managers are just on a power trip .
they got into management because they like to push people around and tell them what to do .
i do n't know if this is the case with your co-manager or not but it 's something to keep in mind .
part of your post is unclear to me—did you say it was your sales associates or your co-manager who claim that you 're slow and lazy do n't deserve your position etc. ?
people will have their opinions but honestly i tend to think that if you 've got haters it 's because you 're doing something they ca n't do !
i do n't think you should throw in the towel just yet .
you 've got so much potential and you care so much about doing the best job you can do .
those sales associates you mentioned—can you imagine one of them taking over your job ?
none of them could do the job half as well as you do it .
it 's after the holidays so you 've just gone through a traumatic ordeal .
personally i enjoy this time because it finally allows me to put my department back together .
the new modulars will be dropping soon and you may feel better about your department after you 've gotten a chance to refresh it .
if you were a failure they would have removed you from your job and had somebody else do it .
think about ordering basic features with an eye towards valentine 's day teddy bears sell really well .
mods are coming so have a plan in place for your deleted items if you have flex space now is the time to use it !
as well as your new mod that will start coming in if it has n't already .
i have confidence in you and i know you can do this .
credit card payments in ynab are pretty confusing and doubly so if there is any unbudgeted spending on them it can really throw off the next months budget if you intend to pay down credit debt and not accumulate it

it also does n't hurt nowadays to have the backing of huge influential companies .
they were just audited and it found that they should repay 700 million in student aid because their online teaching did n't meet the standards that online distance education programs should meet .
the old ge switches you could only trigger 2 scenes when you turn it on and when you turn it off .
i do n't know for sure but it sounds like the new ge switches might allow 4 .
i also think the new homeseer might have 10 .
now i just need to get a second pair thanks to u/littlearson having a pair kicking around thanks !
hi there i 'm old and my party days are over but i just want to say do n't feel bad if you do n't get any takers on this thread .

the other thing is that lebron james is one of the three guys usually considered the greatest players ever jordan/kareem are the others .
he 's better at basketball than any active player is at hockey he should be compared to the likes of gretzky and lemieux who did carry teams quite a bit .
it 's been a long time since i cringed this much amy in this episode was reminiscent of michael scott to me ... on a smaller scale of course .
i think the best episode of this season so far i know we are n't too far into it but it 's been kinda hit-and-miss for me and i laughed so hard at the cold open ! !

asked on msnbc 's morning joe who he talks with consistently about foreign policy trump responded i 'm speaking with myself number one because i have a very good brain and i 've said a lot of things . ''
when i asked donald trump in 2014 about his temperament he readily volunteered this when i look at myself in the first grade and i look at myself now i 'm basically the same .
ok then have fun getting let down when he fails .
you 're worshipping a 24 year old dude on your utopian reddit page and i 'm the loser ?

more than likely yes but never know what would have happened had the points been closer .

i do n't get how people ca n't grasp a simple concept .
you 're a decade younger than me then as are a few people who know several kyles which makes me wonder if
a all the kyles you know now will change their names in a decade
b all the kyles you know now are time-travelled versions of the ones i used to know .
it 's their country why ca n't they choose to only want to have japanese people there ?
i do n't get it who are you to say they should take other people just because they need more skin colors ?

no matter how many times i watch this i always think he is going to cry when he says scandalous !
man is so passionate i cant even believe it .
i think if housing is ever going to work in mmos it needs to be something that has a large communal aspect to it .
devs are always too reluctant to give personal housing too many uses for fear it makes the world feel less alive and detracts from socializing which tends to make housing very stagnant and often little more than a trophy room .
not cordoning personal housing off to its own instance would be a good start .
put housing in towns and at least if those towns need to be instanced you 're still constantly in an area with other players around .
i 'd even love to see it go further with towns being something players have to work together to maintain and grow which could be a direct result of the way players use their houses .
for instance you could only put a vendor in a marketplace if you have quarters for them .
or something like players could build things to generate resources for the town that allow more npcs to move in and set up shop .
essentially give players a reason to use their houses but have it be something that contributes to socializing and not just being in your own personal pocket universe .
i would love to see bjornsson to do a superman punch on someone .
in either case mma fighters make less than their counterpart when in a similar position .

i 've recently been replacing a heap of my media with higher bitrate versions .
i target 9gb movies ±2gb which works out to 8-10mbps .
i used to happily watch 1-2gb movies with bitrates below 1mbps stereo audio but since getting a decent tv surround sound system i can not stand that anymore .
i have found that the difference between a 5gb vs 10gb movie wo n't be as noticeable as the difference between a 2gb vs 5gb movie though .
you go from highly noticeable banding and artefacts to if you are n't looking for it you wo n't notice it .

i think we 'll get jiren but doubt we 'll get toppo or dyspo .
saying that though i actually think toppo and dyspo would be great characters toppo being a slow grappler with his justice flash while dyspo can be the very quick playstyle .

my mother is an absolutely incredible cook and that 's not just the son in me talking even her most vicious backbiting enemies have always conceded that much .
and among women of her generation that used to mean something !
i mention this because my specialty when it comes to cooking is that through my mother and her boiling zeal for cooking i know a lot of very old authentic recipes from several cuisines central-eastern-southern european .
and though i have maybe 1/1000th of her skill i can dispatch them tolerably well .
if you want to eat and eat fairly complicated traditional dishes from the un-americanized and un-industrialized bohemian cuisine hungarian cuisine french cuisine italian cuisine etc. i 'm your man .
what would you cook to impress someone you are dating ?
either i 'd go for an authentic variation on something popular because it 's easy to satisfy every palate with such a thing whilst at the same time bringing something new to them on the table .
simple candidate pasta with traditional ragú which is always an epiphany to peeps raised on spaghetti-with-ketchup-and-minced-meat .
or if i know someone appreciates it i 'd go for a slow stew like bœuf a la mode or cassoulet or székely gulyás .
because that 's where you can show that you got skill and stews are what my heart beats for .
i am down with the t h i c c ness
buffet 's net worth is 84b trumps is 3b higher than i would have guessed .

korean noodles are noodles or noodle dishes in korean cuisine and are collectively referred to as guksu '' in native korean or myeon '' cf .
preparations with noodles are relatively simple and dates back to around bce 6000 to bce 5000 in asia .
in korea traditional noodle dishes are onmyeon beef broth-based noodle soup called guksu jangguk noodles with a hot clear broth naengmyeon cold buckwheat noodles bibim guksu cold noodle dish mixed with vegetables kalguksu knife-cut noodles kongguksu noodles with a cold soybean broth among others .

because mos bvs and jl are basically a trilogy and only 2 of 3 are consistent with each other .
now people can argue which one is better but honestly i just want the snyder cut so it fits better with bvs and mos .
even if it 's worse '' i still believe it will make for a more consistent tone and theme throughout the three movies and actually make it feel like a trilogy .
and make them cost 250 legendary shards for those people who have too many shards and nothing to buy '' .
i 've only watched one once so i 'll definitely check these out !
theory crafting here would the game be viable if they introduced a mill mechanic like yugioh where if you ca n't draw a card then you lose the round ?
feels like it would add more depth and strategy to the game .
avoid overthinning and forces some deck to add more cards to keep avoid the mill .
mostly because screen overlays can be a bitch where f.lux actually changes the display 's colour temperature .
also momentum i 've used it for years on both my phone and pc without issue .
ea is still worse they buy companies to destroy the competition lootbox and milk every single game and then say to the fans we like money only ea activision they are prob ea their son or something they do it silent i guess

there are some really really good mercy players out there .
i watched blinky for a bit and there is definitely decision making going on with the good mercy players .
is there another character that had a significant number one tricks jump from gold one season to masters in the next season ?
so is there some underlying difference between mercy and other characters ?
a big difference between mercy vs the other supports is the fact that you can simply pocket the best player on the team and get carried '' in a sense .
imagine the scenario with a bronze level support main that is duoing with seagull or some other pro .
if that bronze level support runs around as lucio zen ana or moria is that bronze level player going to be that much of assistance to seagull ?
zen orbs or speedboost might come in handy now and again but if the other team dives on the bronze player he/she will probly die very quickly .
now give that bronze player mercy and tell him to just pocket seagull as he goes genji and switching from healing to dmg boosting whenever seagull tells him to .
have that mercy stay up in the air as the pro player dominates with pharah .
the mercy will also be able to rez seagull if he ever dies .
will the mercy have a much bigger impact compared to the other supports ?
obviously my example is a hyperbole but you get the point .
mercy by nature allows your good teammates to perform even better and have a bigger impact even if your skill may be lacking .
the supports require you to rely on your own skill on top of relying on your teammates like anyone else .
in other words mercy is n't brainless to play but your teammates can make up for your own lack of skill easier than with other supports .
cult downvotes incoming ima brace myself actually i do n't care .

hey there i recommend you to go with it hard wax https www.starpilwax.com/collections/stripless-hard-wax/products/blue-film-wax-polymer-blend-beads-stripless-mini-tubs-600gr-starpil because of its the ideal choice for bikini waxing .
from what i have heard all you have you have to do is heat these waxing beads in wax warmers apply it on the skin let it cool down until it hardens enough to be pulled off and then peel it off .
it is more benefactory then soft wax which needs strips so i recommend you check it out .
if you want to get a somewhat strong deck with 2 plats then i suggest you to take 1 with great attack and 1 with great defense .
for example swimsuit ba'al has fairly high damage on her own and liu bei has a nice defense that could help you out .
for other units i suggest a flurry with flurry boost ability as you main source of damage will be ba'al and at least one slice with heal .

it 's nice that this game is getting ports of skyrim and doom but these ports only serve to highlight how much the system is behind it 's contemporaries solely off of processing power i know graphics are n't a big deal but how powerful a system is only boosts it 's longevity in this generation .

well it is clearly and explicitly stated when you transfer that it is a one time only permanent transfer they make that exceedingly clear .
rockstar also disabled all character transfers in march 2017 .
on the other hand just another breath of the wild '' and cuphead '' lovefest .
if they dont do it because of rp reasons they wont do it wether dhk 's are there or not .
i remember that there were more guards in towns and questhubs in tbc than there was in vanilla zones so unless you went with a group you would most likely die before you killed a questgiver or flightmaster .
there was also a minimum of two questhubs in each zone and you could go to another zone to quest most of the time so you still had some options on how to level by questing .
questgivers and the flightmaster in redridge are dead more often than not on the priv server i 'm playing on at the very least .
dhk 's wont ruin world-pvp they are actually a fairly decent deterrent from ganking/griefing .
but i do think they could be changed so you 'd have to actually hit the wrong '' target to get the dhk .

most of androgen can give you more agressive but it depends on person .
fluoxymesterone the molecule is highly androgenic almost 10 times more than the testosterone itself and will give you rapid increase of strength .
it was is widely known in the halterophilia sport for the aggressive boost and strength gain .
carefull with your liver that can be damaged by this compound .
remember also that it will shut down your natural hormones productions not even testosterone but also t3 .
if you want to try start with low dosage like 10mg .
i wo n't recommend to anyone to take only this compound for increase aggresivity .
i really like it and has become a staple for business use .
with functional market capitalism that might be possible but unfortunately nearly every last thing available to purchase that is not hand made is owned by an international megacorporation .
take food at the grocery store for instance if you are an american you are almost guaranteed to be buying from one of the following companies if you make a purchase
there are no real options today save buying local whenever possible .
it 's just that this is a too expensive for many people and b commonly unavailable .

tbh most likely back to muslims and then to someone else and so on .
most likely the switching away from muslims will unfortunately be very temporary .
it 's a shame that he does n't really animate or attempt to create games anymore .
you can hear the passion and interest in his voice when he talks about them .
i know he said he has no interest in animating anymore but i kind of hope he finds his way back to this stuff .
he can be irritating when criticizing other work but he 's actually not a bad content creator .
even though the games were cancelled for a reason it would be cool to see him put that much effort time and creativity into a project again .
just saw the my movie with my gf and it 's been a while since i 've seen the first 3 films .
he probably browsed r/incel when that t_d level garbage sub was still around .

well we 've made it to the new year in some way shape or form .
i delayed this one because people were talking about whatever announcements .
pucatrade economics dashboard https pucatrade.com/help/item/economics i imagine this might be discontinued soon
in the spirit of the new year i included a full lookback on the tix prices for as much of a time window as i have almost a full year now !
we can see that pucapoints have lost something like 1/3 of their value over this timeframe which is obviously not great .
in recent months there has been a climb from tix being around 350 pp each to about 400 and i should mention that tix themselves are arguably losing value against the usd and i would expect this trend to continue upwards ... . we 'll see though .
sometime in december medina mentioned that there were about 7m pps total in escrow .
when i heard this i realized that this provided a good opportunity to get an idea of what the total currency supply is which i had never tried to do because while you can add up the balances on everyone 's accounts pretty easily with a scraper trying to estimate points in escrow is actually more difficult .
but since now i had this info i went ahead and added it up and i believe that the number i came up with was 140 million points total exist .
it might have been 150m but i think it was 140m.. this actually surprised me a bit since it was a larger number than i had expected and unfortunately it made the point removal efforts seem less effective .
that is in total about 40m points were removed in the past year ... that sounds pretty good until you realize that this was only 1/4 of the total points and in this timeframe pucatrade likely lost more than 1/4 of its users this is roughly why inflation continues to climb even as the total money supply continues to decline .
7m in escrow out of 140m total means that about 5 of points are in transit at any given moment .
this is actually a fairly important number for the health of the site and i imagine it has declined a lot .
of balances in total are in use at any given moment and this likely is where pucatrade was at when it was healthier .
as a first pass one could use this to estimate that the ideal '' currency supply for pucatrade would be around 30m since 7m/30m is around 1/4 .
this is a very rough approach but i think it 's safe to say that the ideal currency supply that gets pucapoints worth 70 cents per 100 or more right now is less than 50m .
so we want to be at 50m or so .
we 've removed 40m in the past year and the rate of removal is declining over time with additional activity .
if we just want to tread water the rate of point removal at least has to keep up with user attrition and this most likely is not happening .
this tells us a lot about the magnitude of the current problems .
i do n't think there 's a way to pull almost 100m points out of the economy without involving either major new usage fees or someone taking a major haircut either the site owners hmm.. or people who are holding pucapoints .
pucadues managed to pull out 2.5m points in 4 months .
not bad but when you consider that that 's less than 2 of the overall currency supply it 's not that great either and the ill-will the policy caused may have caused more than 2 attrition from the site but that does n't mean that reversing the policy will reverse that attrition .
sometimes i feel like i should have more ideas on how to fix things but i kinda do n't particularly when it comes to things that would n't require much dev effort .
at the least though i will happily warn about the consequences of the ideas of those who will purport to have cure-alls for the site 's economic woes .
i 've heard people argue that promotions are causing problems for example when in fact cracking down on promotions would likely kill the site overnight .
i worry that focusing on community decision-making is just letting the inmates run the asylum or whatever .
i have argued though that promotion fees should increase simply because point sinks not scaling with inflation is a problem 10 of a card 's base price to promote is just less of a cost than it used to be .
i could also see it being acceptable to have promotion fees scale with the number of promotions you 've made over some period of time eg .
your first 10 per month cost the normal rate 10 for gold your next 20 cost 20 your next 50 cost 30 etc .
you would n't want to do things exactly like this but i think leveraging more fees on heavy users like me is probably okay and would n't cause much fee evasion .
the last topic i want to cover of course is the leadership change itself .
first i 'll give my brief eulogy to eric freytag .
i do n't think the guy is a scammer and i did n't harbor as much animosity towards him as others even though i had far more reason to than most remember the pucapoints.com debacle.. his primary sin though was arrogance in particular an arrogance that exceeded his competence .
my first real contact with the pucatrade team was when i wrote my mtgprice article 2.5 years ago http blog.mtgprice.com/2015/08/24/guest-article-puca-mischief-by-peter-twieg .
go look at james rosenblum 's comment there 's not only a pretty aggressive denial of my article 's primary arguments but some weird insinuation that i was trying to hurt the site .
that 's one thing that i always resented about interacting with pucatrade officials before future site they were extremely defensive and basically dismissed criticism as just haters hating .
i think future site was a manageable problem but driving off the cliff with irresponsible economics was not .
because the team was arrogant there was never any sort of apologies for things going to shit which inspired a lot of bad will and probably created a bunker mentality .
problems that the puca team has engineered were framed as community issues '' as if there was some sort of shared responsibility .
maybe i 'm optimistic but i imagine that putting up this act when knowing deep down that you fucked up was very unpleasant for freytag .
i never became a fierce critic because i suspected it would be unproductive .
turning the site over to medina is a final act of cowardice that again avoids the blame he and the other founders deserve for what happened .
i imagine that running the site was never easy but being unable to level with your users about how things got fucked up is a real personal failure .
that 's not to say that his stepping back may not be the best but imo it is very worrisome because it certainly does illustrate a clear path that leads to the site being closed basically if medina decides it 's not salvageable and is unable to find someone else to take it over then he can just apologize and shut things down .
people including me do n't really blame him for the current state of affairs so there 's definitely a sense that it would n't be an outrage if he closed things .
i mean i guess freytag could 've done it and weathered the hatred but i 'm not surprised he chose to avoid this .
i do n't like criticizing someone so personally but i do think this is worth saying .
despite the news there was n't a panic and pp values have actually increased a bit devon is back selling tix .
so i 'm going to keep using the site and yes letting my gold subscription renew despite not really believing i 'll get a full year out of it but i think everyone should trade with the very real possibility that the site may have less than 6 months of life yet .
be sure to follow medina 's engagement closely to get a feel for how things are going .
myself i actually do n't have as much exposure as usual to a closure right now i have about 500 tied up in the site right now so i can live with this .
tix prices have actually been outpacing the rise in bounties recently which has lead me to send less and draw down my balance while raising my own bounties which i 've seen people get angry at .
i might end up selling tix again in the near future who knows .
in any case there 's been a lot of news but i think the main takeaways are as follows
pucatrade 's economic problems are very deep and the current point sinks are n't keeping up with attrition .
more aggressive point sinks may be needed to stabilize things .
the best economic policies that do n't require extensive development are going to be incremental .
freytag leaving increases the risk that the site will close in the medium term .

my goal is to gradually teach myself calculus using spivak 's textbook .
being almost 30 and never having gone to college i have decided to start from the basics .
so far i have worked my way through most of basic mathematics by lang and most of a college geometry textbook .
here in a few months when i complete the books i 'm currently working on i intend to start spivak .
my question is whether or not i am properly prepared for spivak or if i could be prepared more .
i have the following list of texts that i have managed to buy off the library when they have sales .
elementary mathematics from an advanced standpoint both volumes '' by klein
it may be overkill but i honestly have a lot of free time every day that i 'm willing to fill .
any suggestions of what to study before during or after spivak would be greatly appreciated .
warning some of the statements quotes and details in this caffeine fueled dissection of a beloved urban fantasy series that 's almost as old as i am are going to be common knowledge amongst most of you and there 's probably going to be some incorrect facts due to the time of writing this it 's very late .
there will be some details missing towards the end and i apologize for the redundancy of some of the speculation we all know most of this already .
please feel free to correct me and debate below !
with the date for brief cases finally dropped and with peace talks 's date being announced sometime in the near future please god ... our absence of new dresden is about to be sated to everyone 's immense relief !
but that begs the question that 's been lurking in the back of our minds since brief cases and peace talks were announced ... what 's next for the series after these next to additions to the tale of our favorite wiseass wizard ?
with the book after peace talks being mirror mirror and the book after that being heel turn no title confirmation as of yet but it 's a wrestling book and i needed to call it something it 's in my opinion that us fans need to take a step back and examine the bigger picture .
realistically the dresden files is n't going to continue forever its got a planned end ... that being the bat .
whether jim has the bat planned out i wo n't debate since i do n't know him or the machinations of his mind .
jim has stated that there are going to be 20 something books in the case files part of the series and then it 's capped off by the bat ... which will bring an end to an almost 20 year old series .
it 's in my and some of yours opinion that most likely there will be 1 or 2 more books after heel turn and then after that we 'll break out the box of tissues to kick off the bat .
the plots of two books preceding the bat are unknown but i 'm guessing one of them will be a concept book harry meets kills learns something from someone and the last case files entry will be a prelude of sorts to the bat a hobbit to the lord of the rings type of scenario if you will .
so allow me fellow dresden fans to theorize about what i think will happen to our favorite chicago based sorcerer in the coming years ...
alright so first up we have peace talks here 's what i think is going to happen over the course of the novel along with some info we already know .
fact the book will focus on a summit of supernatural powers coming to chicago to discuss the new status quo of the mystical world no red court new winter and summer lady etc .
justine will be pregnant heard from a friend who backed the card game on kickstarter who said that that 's how the first chapter starts take it with a grain of salt she loves messing with me possibly leading to thomas dealing with the responsibility of raising a half vampire half human child who is unaware of all the nasties out in the world .
speculation we 'll be seeing elaine again as all of her appearances coincide with books whose numbers are perfect squares 4x4=16 i 'm guessing she 'll be the new summer knight as the summer and winter courts are opposites to each other and she and harry 's duality of character would provide some fun plot points plus more opportunities to torture harry and we 'll get to see how far elaine has progressed in her magic since white night
speculation someone important will die at the summit and as per usual harry co. will need to find out whoever killed him/her cliche yes but it 's all i could think of plot wise
speculation harry and murphy will be a bona fide kickass couple at this point much to the relief of their friends .
even though the harry and karrin ship is destined to go full blown titanic i think it 's a little early for jim to kill murphy off when he 's just finally put a relationship into motion that he 's been waving in our face since proven guilty ... it 'll go well for now .
speculation ivy mavra ferrovax the jade court and others will show up ... weak point i know but ferrovax and the jade court need to show their ugly mugs eventually .
speculation the world at large will become aware of the supernatural and everyone 's worldview will be changed permanently
major speculation harry will break a law of magic ... hey there 's only so many books left and he has to break all of them .
we 'll also get to see what bonnie can do .
next is mirror mirror and this ... this i 'm going to have trouble justifying
fact the book will focus on nega harry hail my trusty scott pilgrim reference pulling our harry into his world via some sort of inter dimensional fuckery .
fact nega harry 's world will be the same as our harry 's up until grave peril .
then nega harry will make a decision that our harry did n't make causing his world to be drastically different than our harry 's .
we do not know what the decision is ... but we can only speculate .
glaring question will nega harry drink pepsi and frequent mickey d 's ?
speculation nega harry will attempt to switch places with our harry leading to some unintentionally emotional moments for them both .
what i would love to see is dual pov chapters with our harry on earth 2 and nega harry on earth 1 with both of them seeing the ramifications of their choices ... but alas i can only dream
speculation harry will swim against the currents of time .
after mirror mirror is heel turn and i 'm going to have to dig deep in my tinfoil hat for this one ...
fact the novel will focus on harry investigating a professional wrestling match contest show etc .
there he will be met with the greek gods of old along with a slew of fun millennia old family drama !
speculation we 'll be seeing hades again due to his interest in dresden and the fact that he 's one of the big three of the greek pantheon .
speculation zeus will be hiding amongst the mortals as vince mcmahon ... . if this does n't happen we riot !
the book after heel turn case file 19 will in my mind involve harry training with injun joe and checking up on tera west after 17 years of no contact whatsoever .
harry will learn to shape shift and add another tool to his arsenal for the coming war .
at the end of the novel harry will propose to murphy ... which will be a very big warning sign of whats to come
case file 20 will be a weird one for sure .
we 'll see harry get married enjoy domestic bliss and not burn the house down become a great dad to maggie while teaching her to deal with her emerging magical talent and overall finally be happy .
that is until out of nowhere nicky and the nickleheads show up for one last dance books with multiples of five feature the denarians go figure nicodemus is out for some serious revenge after him losing everything in skin game .
harry is confident that he 'll sweep the floor with nicodemus until bam nic murders murphy .
no trumpets or fanfare no blaze of glory no dying in harry 's arms she 's just brutally killed with no warning whatsoever .
preferably i 'd like it to play out like the season 4 finale of dexter .
harry seeing the love of his life surrogate mother to his child and partner for the better part of 20 years dead .
will go absolutely crazy with rage he 'll obliterate the denarians once and for all but nic will tell him in his dying breath that something is coming ... something that wants to destroy all of reality .
dresden will realize this and will march off to the outer gates with rashid in exile ... cutting himself from his family and friends mourning the loss of murphy and working with rashid to prepare the defenses against the outsiders coming assault .
and that 's how the case files will end with harry beaten down exhausted but determined to save the world .
i have a theory that explains what the three books are going to cover and why .
i believe the order of the books is hell 's bells stars and stones and empty night please correct me if i 'm wrong .
all three of them are curses used by harry and his friends in the world of the dresden files .
hell 's bell 's will pertain to harry 's human relationships star stones to his faerie and wizardly relationships and empty night to his vampiric relatinships and starborn heritage.here 's how it might work
hell 's bell 's this book will start on a time jump of indiscriminate length .
we 'll open with harry after years at the outer gates chilling with rashid being reintroduced to us as an almost godlike figure in terms of power .
after that long in exile harry 's become bitter broken and scarred fighting the outsiders for years now .
at this point he 's gone old man logan except he 's waaaay more powerful than he was before .
then molly will show up with a request for help from faith astor the girl from a restoration of faith or the one who started it all harry refuses but then remembers that that night is when he met murphy and all of the insanity started .
he leaves the outer gates with molly coming back to a changed chicago .
the rest of the book will have harry focus on the human relationships in his life ... . and the looming threat of the outsiders coming to kick ass and take names on a cosmic scale .
stars and stones harry will clear up his debts and call in his markers from the faerie courts and the white council .
both of the two organizations will be scared shitless of ultra harry and will listen to what he has to say .
harry will probably gain control of the council as well as have some serious sway in the faerie courts toot molly sarissa mab somewhere along the line he and molly will recognize their feelings for each other plus all that winter mantle mojo helping out and engage in some good wholesome winter court ... ... fun .
the book will end with a huge battle and the climax of the series ... .
the outsiders will breach the outer gates and invade our reality .
empty night the finale of the dresden files will culminate in a massive all out assault against the outsiders .
it 'll be long bloody and rack up a body count filled with fan favorite characters so high that the red wedding will look tame by comparison .
harry will rally his forces and rush to meet the outsiders head on .
all i 'm going to attempt to theorize is that harry will use one final fuego fueled with his anger joy sadness and faith that will finish the outsiders for good .
and then the story will have a long and winding ending like the return of the king bittersweet ending etc etc etc ...
thank you for sticking through this overly long ranting and somewhat overly optimistic theory on the future of the dresden files .
eventually i 'll fill in the missing plot points that i kind of eschewed in favor of briefness .
i can imagine that once you 're done reading this you 'll have your own opinion so feel free to share it and compare your theories down below .
again i apologize profusely about any misspelling and lapses in information it 's about 12:30 as of writing this and i wanted to finish it to be uploaded in the morning .

hi guys i 'm looking at upgrading my 128gb ssd to a 256 ssd because it is full .
i know that it is very difficult to find a 3rd party ssd that is compatible will these used ssds work ?
if they will as it says how would i go about setting it up ?
would i just put it in and fire it up or is it more difficult than that ?
edit one more question what is the difference between the 3 ssds ?

if there is something else you would change or recommend for that budget let me know .
while surfing on mainstream media i glanced at an article about rust .
while der spiegel is sometimes reporting about games or technology i had not expect to read this first sentence translated
the press of a button was enough for tyler to destroy the metropolis cape town . ''
i thought i would share the article even if it 's in german .
to correct a bit of misreporting no there wo n't be an orville/family guy crossover and yes the orville season 2 will arrive later this year .
i have n't seen anything about a crossover with family guy do n't know where that came from but it 's good to hear that the rumours of a delay into 2019 are wrong .
so obviously this roleplay is going to revolve heavily around incest i dont mind whichever one of the above you wish to play in the family .
so it could go a few ways maybe dad or your boyfriend or husband isnt satisfying you anymore or doesnt take care of you and decide to use me to help relieve some stress even if you know its wrong .
it could be that im heading off to college and you know im a virgin from the lack of girls i bring back so you decide to take care of it .
or lastly it may be a case of me being more forward and flirty with you know im all grown im horny and decide to use mom to take care of that .
all of these would of course be 18 themes and we can discuss ages .
kinks limits and anything else you 'd like through pm .
this is also open to a celebrity idea if thats more your style message me with the celeb
of what i started a few days ago when i asked myself what would a normal person think of the for honor heroes ? so here it is with the vikings .
i tried to make is more fluff-like than battle-like so if you liked or disliked it be sure to let me know !
anyway enjoy and do n't worry samurais should follow soon !
here is the part 1 for those who are interested
raider the benedictions of our gods are sometimes shrouded in mystery and sometimes they appear with the same intensity as the sunlight .
when that woman came down from the mountain her axe resting on her shoulder and her scars for everyone to be seen i remember our jarl mumbling
oh mighty thor thank you for sending your champion to us ...
as she walked through our camp i could see the men starring at her but not as if she was a person she was an ideal .
a testament of the strength of our people of our resolve and endurance despite the harshness of our lands and the hatred of our enemies .
and while some of us doubted about her and criticized our jarl 's decision to let her lead the charge no one had complaints once the battle was over corpses at her feet and blood dripping from her axe as she screamed towards the sky .
one hel of a woman with a surprisingly gentle attitude with the children of our villages .
i often see her playing with them spending even more energy in their games than when she fights .
warlord our jarl is wise as an owl strong as bear and more resilient than the stone in which our ancestors carved the statues of our gods .
he has seen many winters and although he feels the strength of his youth slipping away he endures and guides us .
often i see him telling the children of our villages the legends of our people the story of our gods .
he is father to us all and he would give his life without hesitation if it could save even one of our people .
in battle no one sees the flow of battle has clearly as he does .
he knows where and when he is needed and his experience gave him a few tricks that few opponents expect .
i often hear him roaring a name ... cena i think it is .
maybe that 's the name of some old god he worships ?
and when the fight is over he tends to all who need his help and prays for each men or women that died despite his own wounds .
if he is to die be it on the battlefield or in his bed i know the gates of valhalla will be wide open for him .
berserker my grandma used to tell me stories of legendary beasts that roamed the wilds hunting everything they sighted until they could n't find anything else and died starving .
but their spirits remain and their instincts are still very alive .
they just took another form ... and he is one of them .
he hunts with the swiftness of a wild cat and the endurance of a wolf and he reveals in it .
every battle is a way for him to unleash the primal strength that inhabits him .
it 's a terrifying sight ... but there is beauty in his relentless style a beauty that remains hidden to those who do not understand the fire in his heart .
because although he fights like a beast he is still a man and he cares for his comrades as if he shared their blood ... as long as they do n't criticize his talent for juggling with his axes that is .
but when she does she speaks with the truth and the wisdom of the gods .
she knows the signs of the aesir and it 's more often that not her that our jarl sends ahead of the troops scouting discreet as a weasel .
she sees and comes back sometimes with blood on the point of her spear or shield ... but it 's never her own .
in battle she is swift precise and deadly her weapon striking like lightning .
she stitched me a few times already and many of us owe her their life .
ironically many of us also owe her a few broken bones and some bruises .
if there is anything she ca n't stand it 's hands wandering where they should not except for the shaman with which she acts like a bear mother would with her cub .
and the gods be my witnesses she does not hesitate to show when she is angry making her even more bear-like .
highlander i have to admit i somewhat envy that man .
the claymore he wields is at least twice as heavy as my own sword and yet i 've never seen him sweat a drop except maybe when he and the raider have a drinking contest .
i also pity him for he joined this fight because he was forced to like many of us .
it is reassuring though to see such a man among us .
he is undeniably a champion of our gods and the trials of our lands made his skin and bones as strong as stone and steel .
and while his sword does most of the demanding work during battle it always amazes me how many insults and spikes he can hurl at our enemies .
i wonder where he finds them ... one thing is sure it always makes me smile when i hear him scream dunmahglass because i know that his opponent is on for a rough time and a dreadful end .
they say she is possessed by some evil spirits or that she simply ate too many mushrooms .
although she is quite difficult to approach it makes me chuckles to see how she behaves when we are not fighting she is like some kind of child looking and touching everything new that she gets her eyes on .
i even saw her trying to eat a golden coin once .
she seemed quite disappointed when she realized it was not edible but after spitting the piece of metal she grabbed it again and spent the afternoon trying to ask our generals what it was in that sketchy speech of her .
not sure how it ended but i 've seen her playing with that coin afterwards sitting on the beheaded body of some unlucky fool that underestimated her .
taggings hopefully it works x if you want me to tag you on the rest be sure to let me know as well o
one of my all-time favorite modern-day spiritual teachers is eckhart tolle !
i just love how he helps the world learn how to stay in the present moment with words that hit a cord and make you think oh yeah that 's exactly right
i 'm pretty sure its my biostar motherboard bought it before i realised how shit they are https youtu.be/p7y6lqpyeem
i just installed arch yesterday on virtualbox and decided to install a desktop environment .
i got the packages for kde plasma and set sddm to auto start on boot .
however once i started it i realized i could n't login as root only as a user but i only have one user besides root and i never gave it a password dumb mistake i know so now i ca n't log in .
i 'm wondering if i can get back to the terminal so i can give the user a password .
with the launch of knc we got a new card which is seen in all aggro decks corridor creeper .
but somehow i ca n't get to wrap my head around why it 's so good .
most of the times when it comes early on in your hand it 's awesome .
but somehow during the late game when you 're in topdeck mode it 's just a hugely understatted minion .
in those scenarios a fell reaver or a bittertide hydra might be much better .
in aggro paladin adding this card makes sense as that deck has a capability of flooding the board in an instant and therefore most of the times this card will be a 0 mana 5/5 .
but why are people playing this card in decks like pirate warrior or even in tempo mage ?
seeing it in aggro druid makes sense but the aforementioned two decks do n't make sense to me .
i think that i 'm missing some very important detail of this card .
can someone please explain how to play this card and when to add this in your deck ?
item im willing to do 2:1 gbc also 2:1 leftovers for other items ask .
hello first post here so please bear with me .
i get migraines usually once or twice a week .
they alternate between the left or right side of my head on rare occasion both at once .
right side is always worse accompanied by nausea and 9/10 pain .
i am 21 and have been taking maxalt rizatriptan since age 10 until about 2 years ago .
i discontinued use because it started to be a hit or miss .
i tried other tryptans such as sumatriptan and that new one with naproxen but they were also a hit or miss .
since last year my neurologist put me on depakote antiepilelectic to reduce the occurrence of my migraines and i have been using excedrin regularly for the past couple of years as needed for when i actually get one .
so for the past year before i even started the depakote and after discontinuing the tryptans i have been waking up painfully dizzy with migraines in the morning that eventually go away once i actually get up and out of bed or get worse especially if i decide to sleep in .
not to mention i have had issues with feeling groggy and blurred memory as well .
after a clean mri i have been consulting with my neurologist about it but he assures me that it should go away once we finish my treatment of depakote .
after being sick of the toll this has been taking on my quality of rest and short term memory loss i finally decided to do a little more research and have come to the presumption that this may all be caused by the long term use of otc excedrin i have been using roughly once a week for the past couple of years .
does this sound like a case of rebound headaches to the more experienced migraines sufferers here ?
despite me keeping it under the maximum dosage per day and per week for the excedrin .
it really has me doubting my neurologists expertise and wondering whether i should visit a neurologist more experienced in migraines .
buying 1 or 2 graphic tee 's and i want to support some smaller brands .
link your stuff and i 'll take a look .
hello every time i go into the elevator and try to join my friend it says his court is not available at this time and kicks me to the menu there is also no option to allow friend to join or to invite .
i 've never mined before and i do n't have much to start out with .
what is the best recommendation for a low to mid priced gpu ?
i imagine i will need a new power supply .
however i do n't want to get one that has too high a wattage since some folks have told me that doing that could cause a fire .
okay this is a long story so i 'd appreciate any help .
i have a cousin whose not the sharpest tool in the shed .
gets in trouble a lot borrows money and disappears on people drugs etc..
for the longest time i was one of the last people that would help her .
one of the things i helped her with was a cellphone .
i bought her an iphone 7 from sprint and many a thing happened and now i took it back and cut her support off .
i want to turn it in to sprint as that would end my contract with them and the bill but they wo n't take it back .
they tell me they wo n't accept it with an icloud lock dont see why that matters at this point they can run the serial number and see it 's in my name but whatever .
so fine i take it to the genius bar but they cant or wo n't unlock it unless i have an email .
she wo n't give it to me out of spite am i just out of luck with this thing and have to pay off the 400 for a paperweight ?
it seems like every time i post an ad now even one the system is asking for phone verification this is for personals obviously .
if i want to post another either it wo n't let me or it asks for phone verification again if i use a different email .
creating another number via the numerous voip based second-line apps does n't work with cl .
i do n't spam or post a hundred ads but yeah sometimes i 'll post three or four over the weekend looking for different things .
can you recommend a service that offers sms based numbers that 'll work ?
my friend bought three disposal phones he keeps active but i do n't want to do that .

i am capable of doing pencil inks and full color .

please post how to generate and store cardano keys offline .
acceptable answers are generating the private key in trezor or ledger hardware wallets using hw cardano or 3rd party clients or generating private key on an offline airgap pc and signing transactions from the airgap pc .
i already know how to generate private keys online using deadalus and deleting the client .
that requires the pk to be generated online then entered again online to send from the wallet .
i 'm looking for something more secure than that .
bitcoin ripple eth nem litecoin and stellar can generate pks offline and use them by signing transactions without having to type or transfer the pk to the online wallet ever .
i am looking to model a genetic disorder for a presentation .
by model i mean a 3d physical model that can be used to show what the genetic disorder does on a the molecular cellular and tissue level .
a tube was used along with a round ball and a sickle shaped model .
when the sickle cell was dropped into the curved tube it got stuck and the other regular round blood cell could not pass through .
so i was wondering if anyone here could think of a genetic disorder that could be easily represented with some sort of 3d model and i 'll be eternally grateful .

but at home in my personal life i do n't get anything done .
every night i come home eat watch tv and crash .
my apartment is a dump 90 of the time .
i tell myself i 'll do it this weekend '' but it never happens .
i generally suck at being an adult and i 'm much older than most of my friends .
i have n't been on a date in over a year .
i feel like the years just keep slipping past me and before i know it i 'll end up old fat and alone with dementia like my uncle .
why is it so fucking hard to just be like any other normal person and just get off my ass and do something about it ?
why do i always end up on the couch wasting hours in front of the tv ?
even if i do find motivation to do something like clean exercise whatever the moment is fleeting .
u/mauriziotx and i got to chatting some time back about doing his verification .

i think those people either do n't play mercy or do n't use damage boost as much as they should .
i do n't think the nerfs are all that bad .
i used to save valkyrie in case the fight was lost so i could easily rez two tanks .
but now because they got rid of the second rez charge valkyrie does n't need to be saved just for that rez anymore .
you can finally use it and damage boost your team when pushing .
and just use it a lot more often in general .
it is a different play style now but still very very useful .
wondering if anybody can help me out on this some of my planes have a symbol in the top right corner .
on the filter screen they 're labeled first victories how does it get that recognition ?
it 's still running constantly even after the registry tweak from https www.howtogeek.com/265027/how-to-disable-cortana-in-windows-10 so what do i do to kill it completely ?
hi i 'm trying to use a spritesheet i 've found off the web .
however it 's been packed efficiently '' and is n't in a regular grid .
what 's the easiest way to use this spritesheet ?
i 've been using gimp to cut paste each frame into a separate file and loading into a godot animatedsprite spriteframes .
but this is extremely time consuming and error prone .
is there any way to use the spritesheet in godot directly by specifying coordinates for each frame ?
or is there a better free art tool out there that can help me to decompose the spritesheet more easily ?
how do people work with these sorts of spritesheets ?
i am having some difficulty figuring out if my plan for wiring the output from a relay is going to work .

the wires to the outlet have n't being added yet to the photo .
is there anything wrong with wiring the relays like that ?

i feel this is a house-rule issues but i wanted to know how other dms deal with exploits like this .
in the director 's commentary for logan mangold states about how he played the last of us but only after the fact .
the first time he heard of the last of us was when people started tweeting at him comparison pictures of tlou and logan .
he called it a great game '' so we did it reddit but mostly twitter ! !
later he goes on to say that he does n't have a lot of interest in directing a movie based on the last of us .
he said he would be basically making the same movie as logan .
i paraphrased a lot but that was the gist of what mangold said .
people change and mangold could be up for making the movie if given a producer role .

what are some really nasty combos you guys have ran across i 'm looking for ideas ?
what feats or stats do you need to make them work ?
so a little about me i 'm a 28 year old male and my last relationship was well over 4 years ago .
it seems i have gone rusty on talking to women outside of a professional environment since all i have done for the past 2 years has been working non-stop on a new city where i have not had the chance to socialize .
basically i go to work get to sleep a few hours and repeat monday through friday and sometimes saturdays too at a company 's legal department in a big city .
i use my weekends to rest mostly and recharge for the week ahead along with the new job i got into really bad habits little sleep fast food and no exercise basically going from looking strong healthy and relatively good looking to being obese and with no condition whatsoever .
along with my fitness i seem to have lost a great deal of self-esteem and confidence and i did n't realize it because i was so submerged into my job .
well a girl from my hometown i really like moved to the same city and same neighborhood as me and we have run into each other a lot ever since .
she 's really great she is a great talker and an even better listener she knows more about sports than i do heck we both are both fans of the same soccer team she is also very smart and geeky she plays the same games i do she is a fan of most of the stuff i 'm a fan of and to top it off she 's beautiful .
i asked her out casually to a movie and while she said yes she cancelled on me at the last minute for reasons i know to be valid and not some bs excuse of not going out with me .
however this caused me to take a good look at myself i had n't realized how far i 'd let myself go .
i had n't realized how much of an insecure mess i am and i realize i 'm not comfortable with the person i am right now sure professionally i 'm doing great but other aspects of myself require some serious work on my part .
i have begun working on myself you know this week i went to a proper nutritionist and i have begun exercising again i have also begun taking guitar lessons on a local school i 've always wanted to learn and i 've returned to church after a long time say what you will about religion but on my case it helps me .
i want to give it a few months to work on myself first because i know for a fact that i need to do that before attempting to enter any type of relationship .
however i really like this girl and i know she wo n't remain single for long in a city as big as the one we live in where there are literally a thousand other better looking men .
i have texted her and asked to hang out soon to which she has said yes nothing concrete and i know that 's a mistake on my part .
but i have no idea on how to proceed with her while i work on myself and after all these years 4 all i 'd really like is a win you know to finally attain the love of a woman i like .
i 'm not a player nor do i intend to be and i never pursue a girl i do n't really like as a matter of fact i have had only 2 girlfriends what i 'm trying to say here is i never have been good at dating and i do n't know how to proceed here so any advice is appreciated !

it 's just another normal friday night for you .
you went for a stroll in the park like you usually do every night .
you take in the peaceful sounds of the birds the wind blowing softly while you watch the sunset light up the sky one more time before it will disappear for the night .
well today things are gon na change for good .
as you walk up to your regular sitting spot a meteorite enters the earth 's atmosphere plunging towards the earth it 's estimated landing spot ?
that park you 're in ... you have no idea what 's about to happen as you sit down on that bench .
the meteorite is but a speck of dust in the sky but it keeps on getting bigger .
that little speck turns into a little ball and keeps on getting bigger .
you suddenly notice it that fire ball coming straight towards the park .
luckily you noticed it in time because right after you run away to hide it slams into the ground .
you curiously look over the bench approaching the steaming crater ... what you find inside is a metal object big enough to fit a child in .
you wonder what it is that has crashed in front of your feet .
before you can check it out a bright light shines out of the metal object as it opens up .
you gasp as you see something emerge from the vessel ... it 's me ...
this is a rp that 's set in modern times .
now what i am looking for is a female who 's up for some giant stuff .
my character is an alien from a planet far far away what 's so special about her species is that every time they cum they grow exponentially in size .
they grow taller have bigger cocks become bustier you name it .
so my character is on a quest to find a mate with whom she can have sex with because her goal is to become the biggest on her planet .
she is a futa which makes things easier of course .
her cum does have a side effect the one who consumes it also undergoes some growth but not as big as the growth of my character .
when you message me i 'd like to know what your limits are regarding size .
i 'm a guy just to give you a heads up .
at times i think that i 'm in capable of taking it anymore .
i 'm sick and tired of constantly having islam and my parents control my every .

my past 4 years of school have basically been hours spent on the computer watching youtube and aimlessly scrolling through twitter .
my dad has me memorize half a page of the quran a day read one islamic book and summarize it every week for a month until i start another book .
not to forget the hadiths he has me memorize throughout the week .
and somehow he expects me to do all this while finding the time to take care of my baby sister .
i have 3 years till i can move out .
who knows if i 'll even hold up to february .
i play skyrim se on my dell xps-15 laptop and with 23 mods including smim realistic water 2 and helgen reborn it runs at a consistent 50 fps though my computer heats up if i do n't keep the fan completely unblocked .

the arcana already gives a custom animation for her q i just want to know if i have her arcana and the yulsaria 's glacier kinetic gem which animation for her q would take priority .

i recently had a dream where i was hanging out sitting somewhere with my hands behind my neck .
some dude comes up and tells me whoa you holding hands with a girl ?
that joke went over my head and i only got it later when i woke up .
hows that even possible to have a character of your own imagination make up a joke you dont get ?
sometimes i acccidently let the ball pass thought and run after that and maybe passing the ball like moonwalk passing '' the body move and pass without running haha .
i was playing this morning ranked and was playing as bushwacker .
set up a turret around the corner in the last stage of underground and was camping on the crates above it .
couple of proxies rush in i jump down to take them out and die immediately .
the screen shows turret damage to me along with them .
this is the first time ive had this happen or even heard of this .
anyone else got killed by their own turret in ranked ?
is there somewhere i can find an employee handbook ?
i 'm looking through all of my new hire emails from last year and not seeing anything same with myhr ?

in my opinion the p250 is a bad gun after its nerfs i think valve should make it aqain be able to kill in 1 headshot but only at close range like 500 units because it is hard to use with not really mutch pay off 300 for a gun that is loud and it only gets people low in close range .
im ok with weebs if they spam something related to the situation in forsen stream .

i never have a problem with gachifag except during the thunderremix fest .

i read this book in the early to mid 1990 's so it was published around that time .
the story if about a mother who lost her son .
the son starts contacting her coming to her in dreams speaking through things etc ...
the mom finds out the boy is not dead and is being held at an institution and goes to rescue him .
mom is an ex dancer who likes a skin of peanut butter on toast
the son leads her to him in the building by blinking the lights in the hall .
it is not hear the children calling by clare mcnally but i read it about that same time .
stumbled upon this piece of code and struggling to fully understand the technical reason for this kind of behaviour
why using the normal arithmetic operation on mylist in foo function doesnt affect the global mylist while using the iadd in foo2 affect it ?
i am still a beginner but according to my understanding that global variables cant be changed inside function unless called specifically .
does list have different behaviour because of their mutability or the iadd is the key difference here ...

i have n't seen this be discussed before but a few weeks ago the salaries of the cast of real housewives of atlanta were leaked !
cynthia bailey 1.6 million a massive increase of 400,000 from last season !
kandi burruss 2 million no surprises here they upped her salary from last season as well .
kenya moore 1.5 million but apparently she was fined for the private wedding and did n't go on the trip to spain
porsha williams 800,000 the lowest paid member of the cast .
the highest paid member of the cast the producers seemed to really want her back .
what do you guys think about how much everyone is getting paid ?
it seems about right to me but i really feel nene is being overpaid she really does n't bring that much to the show .
i am also pleasantly surprised that cynthia is getting that much money ! !
she is being paid more than kenya moore which is insane to me .
also i 'm quite shocked at how expensive all the housewives are !
i mean i 'm happy they getting that money but damn .
he wishes to tear it from me with my tears bleeding through its seams
there is no true dream for the blind live a lie
a lie that will never end but will only if he is to die
the waves get closer now calling a name i ca n't hear
but my will itself will make the ocean bleed make it rend
my phantasms will ride its waves making the black water sear
he puts crowns on false prophets those unholy filthy charlatans
my dream will grow and fester to over take this peutrid fraud
his dream will wither and die that fool who wishes to call himself god
but still his blind slaves still follow yet i know they live as harlequins
there dreams are not there own only slaves to the grinding machine
a machine who believes endless screams are so perfectly serene
he thinks the world is set on a path built by his own ego
but little does he know his story ends not with deus ex machina
he is not an ocean of gold but a machine of rust
and the only dream i have is to rend his into dust
to free the blind from his cage is the dream i alone seek
and through his twisted and black dream do i begin my final steps
as i stride willingly into the ocean and drink from its depths
and as i dive deeper and deeper i learn the lie of his dream
the lie of a lie and when i find the truth i beam

looking for any tips on adjustments or changes i should be looking at as we approach our trip .
in the logitech software it seems like the leds only become light blue if i select a white color .
i have to mess around with intermediary colors like a slightly red white to get a gray .
i 'm researching what will work best for my diaper pail with our washable wet bags/pail liners .
my husband and i want a metal container to trap all the stick .
however i 'm reading that it is important to get airflow to the liner/wet bag so as not to breed bacteria such as using a hamper with openings on the sides .
i 'm worried that if i have an open to the air '' system the soiled diapers are going to stink up my nursery and house .
i really do n't want an unnecessary lingering ammonia and/or poo smell .
has anyone built an additional home or duplex on their property ?
i 'd also love to hear from any realtors with advice on possible options for an older home on three acres in a good location surrounded by a much higher density .
would you fix and sell the older home put a duplex on the unused lot of either side and sell as three or find a buyer that wants to tear down and put in higher density housing if that is an option ?
ca n't move forward at least today but i 'd like to find out what the possibilities might be .
i mentioned that to someone on dirge 's channel and the whole chat immediately jumped on it saying that was bad advice and not to listen .
i would never say that was your strongest line-up !
what i would say is that if you take out your first xi and make your strongest xi from the remaining pool of players 7-8 of those on the pitch today would be in this second xi .
i 'll be honest bro i seem to get that feedback a lot about the synths being too stocky and cheap etc .
any ideas on how to change that because i have no clue lol
i like to make use of enums quite a bit as they are an easy way to avoid type issues .
if your api takes a string any string will do but if it takes a specific enum type you wo n't mix them up by mistake .
also if a constant is n't used in multiple places i put them in the file where they are used as a private let .
if constants are used in many places i simply divide them up logically as per above comment and generally use enums or static classes .
no need to go through the hoopla of objects or singletons for that .
generally i prefer static classes to singletons as it makes much more sense from an object oriented point of view .
most often going to be coming up with 2 outs and no one one so nice to have a little pop here so he can score on the home run .
nice to have speed here so he can run the bases while the bottom of the lineup hits singles .
ah yes batting your fifth best hitter both 3rd and 5th ... a strategy they will never see coming !
that was a joke and the point still stands .
look you ca n't dictate what people say on account of how sucky '' or pervy '' you think the things they say are .
that 's not how it works irl or online .
granted private industries as you say have rules put in place but as i 've said i broke no rules .

also if ripple files a case trx investors can as well then .

fender mustang iii v2 has xlr outs to go direct and sound great .
tube amps are n't going to work well going direct typically .
wish more amp makers would wake up to the need of going direct and realize it 's been an issue as long as i have been abusing guitars 3 decades now .
the reasons to go direct are many and most places require it now .
modeling gear has made it easier but by saying that it opens a debate that sidetracks the original question .
if the venue permits the volume i say tube amps and mic them .
if it requires you to go direct i say grab a modeler and do it .

there is not enough evidence to even approach conviction beyond reasonable doubt when they are dropped .

so recently i hatched a feebas from a 10k and noticed that i could walk it to evolve it .
i found this odd because 1 i had no idea this feature was a thing and 2 this option does n't appear for other pokemon whether they were caught or hatched new or old gen granted i have n't hatched many gen 3 if any with the exception of feebas so maybe the option is there i just have n't seen it other than this one instance .
for example recently i hatched a dratini from a 10k but the walk-to-evolve option was not present for it .
by that i mean to which pokemon does this feature apply to ?
edit also can someone explain what 's the feature exactly ?
like is there more to it than just walking to evolve or is it just that ?

i 've had several family members with kia and hyundai iron
my parents have had 3 kia and hyundai products a 05 sportage a 05 xg350l and their current car a 10 amanti that my grandparents gave them when they moved to florida .
they also own a malibu but really like the amanti .
no issues from any of them really and my stepmom would consider another 05-10 sportage if the gas mileage was better 2.7 v6 was slow and thirsty
my aunt and uncle owned a last gen sedona and the only reason they traded up was because their large family out grew it .
i just picked up a ‘12 forte not my first choice wanted a xj jeep or a golf/gti but was worried about the latters reliability and the newest xj was too old to finance with my credit union .
for a while kia had a porsche engineer in charge of vehicle tuning and reviews of new kia 's in this time period 05-10 sportage final gen spectra 06.5 to 10 optima rondo last gen sedona reported decidedly nice chassis tuning .
hopefully the stingers reported goodness can trickle down to current kia products but some mags say even that needs some fine tuning .
it 's just that not many of them are fun aside from special models .
honda has mostly got its make everything fun to drive mojo back and mazda has n't gotten rid of it for years now .
it would be nice to see kia or hyundai embrace that mindset as well seemed like they were getting there for a while .

and there are two things that i think draw people to give 1 a personal connection with the creator and 2 information or perspective from the creator .
there is one podcast i support solely because the man who runs it is in my opinion perhaps the kindest man on our planet .
he is a force of positivity on the internet and deserves success .
there is another creator i support because his short videos about history and various topics are thought provoking and informative .
i am less likely to give somebody my hard earned money if i do n't feel like i 'm getting something in return .
i think you need to add either a little more of your personality to your videos or a little more information about your process .
i can tell you this if i was going to support you it would be at the 3 level because i 'm always looking for my sculpting tips .
i hope you see this as helpful and not rude or critical .
i obviously like your work and i wish you success .

in case it 's unclear u/hengast is n't attacking liverpool fc fans specifically he 's mocking the native population of the city of liverpool .
it 's a reference to the we 've always got it so much harder than everybody else '' attitude which is frequently ascrbibed to liverpudlians .
an example of how liverpool is viewed by much of the rest of england can be seen in this link https www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/15/scouseproud .
incidentally this popular conception of liverpudlians was also fuel for the 'always the victims it 's never your fault ' chant started by man utd fans during the period when luis suarez was facing racism allegations .
you probably want to look into the hotel packages themselves .
it 'll take away the biggest stress of getting transfers into the festival and from the festival each day https www.tomorrowland.com/en/global-journey/packages/hotel-packages
i went to brussels in 2016 while the festival was happening and was able to stay in one of the designated hostels meininger hotel brüssel city center and did n't make it to the festival so it 's possible that your sister could simply book in the same hotel/hostel too just not as part of the festival .
there 's the option with the train of simply not getting on the shuttle bus once you reach brussels the eurostar train from london goes into the brussels midi station .
most of the tomorrowland shuttle buses were going from that station so i would expect other destinations to be heading there as well .
i 'd have to disagree with you on a few of these points .
i feel that the reality is we are a generation that 's raised in technology .
believe me i 'm the first to tell you that i dislike the toxicity of technology but the fact is it 's also made completely from and out of nature .
on my last trip i started to become conflicted by all the materialist items around me .
then it suddenly dawned on me how actually beautiful humans and humans minds could be to be able to create such complex items from our very own planet .
as a younger millennium '' and somebody who is learning how to utilize technology for all of its benefits i feel it is important to point out that i hear so much toxicity towards my generation .
this has created a rift of disillusionment and confusion even more .
i feel that there is a difference between living amongst technology and then creating a full identity and dependence on it .
bad trips happen for a reason and even though are disastrous are sometimes very necessary for an individual .
i know my bad trips were the only way i could learn how to surrender in my daily life .
i do agree with you about it being used as a party drug but to each there own .
the only thing to do is warn others about it not to be used as such .
i completely agree with you about humans needing necessary time in nature .
it is so essential in these days where it is rare .
i just feel that we must grow with the world and adapt to its very strong changes .
we must bring that consciousness and magic '' from psychadelics into the lives of others and the materialistic world around us .

we are gaining traction fast because of all the bitcoin core mania then people try to use the product after they bought it and felt lied to .
i mean ... bitcoin org devs are still trying to figure out what to do with https github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/2010 ? 1 what it says on bitcoin.org
so then users with a bad user experience this is not what i signed up for will probably shop around and find the other bitcoin .
some people might even reason hmmm bitcoin core is like 16 000 usd and the other bitcoin is like 3000 usd .
do n't get me wrong i do n't think there is any justification for the high market prices but bitcoin cash should be able to survive a market crash because of its utility behind it .
for people who do n't speculate a market crash is not the worse thing .
i sell the bitcoin cash i get for my work on a regular basis and i can be honest about why because i do n't trust the exchange fraud like tether or volume numbers out of korea .
however now that i have a small income in bitcoin cash it 's a little bit but it will grow it really does not affect me as much as a holder or a speculant .
and real human beings that want to use bitcoin cash as payment system that has all kinds of benefits do n't have the incentive to go online and make to the moon '' type of posts .
so nobody knows about them but they are there .
so lots of good stuff is happening fast and we welcome all ex-cult members that finally realize they have been bamboozled for years by the upper management of the bitcointologists .
the flippening might happen in 2018 which would be totally crazy .

the mental strength that they have to keep coming back must be huge .
i know people will say well they 're still earning money and yeah there is that but i think people forget the recovery process they hav to go through not walking for a while without crutches and then back to the gym .
now imagine doing that multiple times like it 's some sort of routine while still hoping that you 'll come back and this time this time it will be different and you 'll get to play more and stay fit .

i do n't think mines are made with a short term intent .
unless it 's designed to degrade which could be nasty if they are say stored for future use .
mines are likely made like most military weapons and are designed ideally to last as long as needed .
with 45 blocks i am getting only like 230 h/s .
the number of people i see completely absorbed in their devices is very high on average i 'd say half of them .
sometimes on a train it is closer to 90 .
and it 's unlikely that they 're all busy learning about the circumstances and organizing themselves .
most of them are commuting to some shit job every day but it pays their bills .
when i can peek at their screens most people are either playing games or scrolling through their fb feed .
i get you guys bitching about it but part of the blame goes to how big12 is geared towards pass defense which means the lbs are different slightly smaller which was on display when chubb bounced off them a few times .
also credit has to be given to fromm who shocked me with recognizing defensive alignments and changing plays to exploit it when he started doing that ou should have called time out .
we did find out our secondary needs help that did worry me going into this game .
so they know the saa is about to capture larger areas .
they actually lasted for years not 90 days but only a few days against the tigers ' assault
the biggest red flag was when the guy tried to justify being a dick as what his character would do ''
i find that this is an extremely common problem with virtually all newer players and even some seasoned players .
99 times out of 100 it 's not a matter of wanting to be a dick and then using the character as an excuse .
it 's a matter of legitimately thinking that his character has to be a dick because he created this character and then the party got in this situation and doing anything out of character would be inappropriate and metagaming .
typically with people like that once you take some time with them to explain that they 're misunderstanding what the point of the roleplaying is and what its purpose is within the game they realize what they 're doing wrong .
then they can start trying to turn the party 's adventure into a good story instead of always trying to follow the rules they made up for how their character will act .
no i am simply exploring the implications of you philosophy .

installing software requires internet access and asking apple servers for permission and most of the time they gave it usually for last two public updates and cease signing for older ones .
like right now you can only install 11.2 and 11.2.1 .
even jailbreaking does n't let you install anything you want you need to save an authentication file tied to your unit while apple signs the software and even then downgrading can render touch id useless because its security chip gives incompatibility problems .
because iphones have gotten so fast in the last couple of years updates do n't slow them down as much as let 's say a 4s that 's barely usable on ios 9 i have one .

in other words it looks a lot like a mistake !
is the anime going to continue with this mistake making further deviations from the manga to accommodate the berserk mode '' ?
is the anime going to forget about this berserk mode '' as if it never happened ?
in either case the anime is unfortunately placed in an awkward spot ... same with the idea of fusing titans in crystals .

the following comment by neonesp was openly https snew.github.io/r/cryptocurrency/about/log greylisted .
the original comment can be found in censored form at this link
the open modlog https snew.github.io/r/cryptocurrency/about/log reason it was greylisted as reported by r/cryptocurrency was automod rule section 15a filtered for not meeting karma and age standards .

i 've not updated the bios and i 'm not going to either .
intel rushed with the bios update just to shout out that they have already fixed it .
the way intel fixed it is via a microcode update from bios which used ibrs technique and this has some bad performance impact .
on the other hand microsoft and others are working on a technique called retpoline which seems to be much more efficient and this wo n't require a bios update .
i 've decided to hold on for a while and do nothing with bios updates .
i 'll only be just updating windows as and when i get the updates .
i would like to see 2fa for various options mainly for sending .
i think you read my budget wrong tho it was 6.5m😅
as a new player i literally could n't understand why my teammates were spending so much time shopping because all the income i 'd make between visits to a store would barely be enough to buy one item .
the difference between being able to refresh your entire kit every couple of levels and being barely able to afford a single extended magazine once in a while is huge .
to suggest that the power curve is perfectly balanced while leveling is just absolutely naive .
look at all the reviews from players that jumped into the game and then quickly abandoned it with complaints of bullet sponges .
if your playmates manage to get 2-3 levels or more ahead of you group play can become very difficult even for seasoned players with plenty of resources .

there was a libertarian movement to get people to move to keene and basically take over the local government .
no again as i said they are free to take any actions they desire .
these actions are n't to prevent the company from going under which people have been presenting many of these cases as but to have profit margins be the level they desire .
again that is totally with in their right but it is a different argument .
you said 'viable ' which suggests ability to function .
they can function with out these changes but with lower profit margins .
i never suggested companies should just take this on the chin '' i simply did the math to show that they could operate with out any changes even using the ridiculous unrealistic worst case scenario .
the increase in minimum wage is a convenient excuse to raise prices which their analysis probably shows most consumers will accept so their attendance rate wo n't drop much .
any layoffs which would n't hurt their ability to operate would of happened already given their drive to maximize profits .

i was still kinda am hooked on stock android and i 'm coming from a pixel xl .
i would recommend a custom launcher action launcher is my choice nova is also good too .
next i would suggest a custom icon pack such as iride ui which looks just like stock android .
you can also download the google equivalent apps instead of the samsung ones messenger clock phone etc .
finally i would use substratum to theme the n8 to look like stock .
my second favorite theme is swift black the devs also have the normal colors that correlate with stock i just like the black versions to save battery/the look is cooler .
in order for substratum to work a paid app for samsung devices has to be bought it 's 1.99 .
keep in mind the theming does not require root .
as someone who has had their last two phones being the n6p and pixel xl i absolutely love the n8 .
pregnant women should not stop smoking tobacco immediately upon finding out about said pregnancy because it would be too hard on the baby .
lies people tell themselves to continue to be crappy people .
if you 're pregnant just quite smoking for 9 months .
i highly doubt that whatever withdrawal you have is worse for your baby than continuing to smoke for another month or more .

this assumes that they knew he was there and decided to push in to bait out a potential ultimate ... ... .couple of things wrong with this
hanzo would have had to have used his sonic on the archway .
however this means they would have seen reaper before walking though the arch .
explain to me how walking through the gate getting ulted then using mercy ult before pushing is a better use of resources than not doing that walking round a different route and saving mercy ult for the actual teamfight ?
reaper is then out of position while you 're pushing in for the team fight you have better use of zen ult and you still have that mercy ult for when you 're on the point ...
even resetting again with rez but now no enemy death blossom is arguably a better result .
you can not assume they 'd cap the point because reaper was still alive and wraithing away when the clip ends and all his teammates are presumably alive on the point so it 's still a 6v6 but your team has no rez ...
it 's arguable that mercy got her rez baited '' out by reaper so they didnt have it for the team fight ...

i do n't have a powerful computer or a large monitor so space is a really valuable asset .
i wanted to keep all the effects nested so that i can work on these independent units while still keeping in mind the overall picture .

well duh the aliens which look like us are the good aliens and everyone else are the bad aliens .
attack deals 2 damage but attack option use horns to deal double damage but also take double damage .
cast as a mechanic can be used for more than that though .
cast for example could be restore 4 health to your hero '' so you have the option of either attacking or healing up without attacking at all .
so you could attack or use the ability of that minion .
it 's also why i asked if you had to cast on the target you originally chose to attack or not .
because if you do then it does make cast targeting more limited but right now without an answer from op we do n't know if cast can cast past taunt minions .
in addition to that though i have to say i have no problem whatsoever with cast working on minions that ca n't be targeted by spells or hero powers .
cast in no way indicates itself to be a spell or hero power .
two of my friends with pixel 2xl s lose under 2 at night .
so if the minimum possible were 4-5 and my phone did like 7-8 it 'd still be acceptable but 11 instead of 2 is really bad .

download pkgi homebrew from here install on your vita https github.com/mmozeiko/pkgi
on your ux0 create pkgi directory and then create new text file and name it config.txt its full location will look like this
note its parsed nps database vita games only so its contents are more or less the same .
run pkgi homebrew and let it refresh the list .
note dont expect high download speeds it 's vita 's hardware limitation .
but on the flip side i typically ask my team to focus healers but obviously you should n't suicide to do so .
if the healers do n't die most of the time their team does n't die .

when looked at objectively it 's a great album .
but ... it 's a double album and i believe it has no business being that .
i think it could have made for a solid single album .
instead we got a bloated mess of a meandering narrative while being repeatedly preached at by roger waters .
the order is wish you were here is by far their best .
following that it 's a close race for second between dark side of the moon and meddle and animals !
i think i give the light edge to dark side of the moon just because it 's more of a cohesive album than meddle though echoes alone puts meddle up there .
then i 'd said meddle and animals are at about the same level and next after dsotm .
after that i 'd say piper at the gates of dawn and the wall and maybe saucerful of secrets are on pretty much the same level .
anyway in case anyone out there was curious lol .

the story is clear and the interpretations are n't concerning his look or style .
i 'm very critical of the concept of layering historical figures on one another because this way the whole story of these characters gets falsified .
making the main character black is sort of a catering towards that specific demographic which i 'm not against at all but for all i know about african culture they had during that time of the world africans had their own empires with rules and gold and what not .
why do n't they depict these kind of things ?
why taking a white story change the color of the character and sell it as if it would be a part of black history ?
i mean it is part of everyone 's history but there are far better examples from their ancestoral cultures than taking a generic story and change the color of the main character .

it is not necessary to create a currency in order to prevent said institutions from doing those things .
fractional reserve banking can be done with any currency .
if one wanted to prevent the risks of banks doing those things one could prohibit fractional reserve banking .
in fact if a private individual believed people would pay the necessary account fees for a bank that just stores money and does n't lend it one could found a bank like this and see how many customers are willing to pay the fees it takes to maintain the safety and convenience when the bank is n't earning anything through loans .

if a society requires an authority it is by definition authoritarian .
the fundamental component of a libertarian society is the free individual .
how that individual chooses to associate with others is a fundamental freedom .
some will choose a traditional nuclear family life and good for them .
but those who do not choose a gay relationship choose to stay single choose a polygamous or polyandrous relatio ship are no less free individuals .
imposing your own religious values on others is fundamentally unlibertarian .

brett favres first complete pass as a packer was to himself .
on a related matter a friend and i were just having a conversation about the difficulties for newbies setting up accounts and how this could be a big barrier to achieving the trillion plus market cap that everyone seems so certain of .
then i saw this post which kind of summed up the conversation .
we are seeing signs of several exchanges starting to reach critical mass and basically putting the shutters up cryptopia most recently yes small but popular exchange .
exchanges are not public services that have to cater for all clients .
they are corporate entities that have a finite capacity and budget and once this is exceeded they are under no obligation to increase capacity .
just wonder if the multi trillion market cap we all talk of will be highly limited by the poor capacity of popular exchanges .
by doing anything else you are actually reinforcing her behaviour and leading to her subtle accepting that this is ok !

i do n't think either bonesaw or gdq have come out and said exactly what the reasoning behind the ban was so it 's still speculation .
at one point the announcer said something like please refrain from any more owen wilson jokes '' and folk kind of extrapolated from that .
it sounded pretty jokey and playful in my opinion though .
there were a few folk who seemed to think it was because owen wilson might sue as if a celebrity would sue a charity organisation for doing a dumb impression of them .
i think it 's more likely that it 's to do with the repeated swearing and possibly the aircanada thing .

i used to love those when i lived in japan .
they put a heater charcoal in the past electricity now below a low table .
then spread a thick duvet-like cover over the table .
the family sits on the tatami floor with the duvet covering the body up to the waist .
it 's very economical because it only heats the space below the table and not the whole room which are very badly isolated in japan .
i never noticed before but the center kinda looks a person who 's about to sit on a butt plug .

if anyone else has watched bojack has it changed your opinion of her she plays sarah lynn ?
i think it may be as simple as not finding her voice so annoying anymore now that i associate it with a character i like
while i do n't love her now it 's kind of nice to not dread her apperance

i was thinking it would be really neat if instead of just taking cure wounds/healing word as his 1/day 1st level spell i converted life transference from xgte into a first level spell .
my thought is to tone it down to 1d8 damage to self and convert it to a touch spell .
this results in it 's healing range being 2-16 but also has the drawback that for a level 1 character 8 damage is a significant chunk of their health .

so i saw a post on here earlier that essentially said it 's mostly random and when a rare blade is rolled up its spot in the running is replaced with a common '' .
forgive me but i do n't quite think that 's right .
i have a theory the space for rolls is divided in four .
unique and high leveled blades towards the top of their category naturally .
when you select yes '' and begin resonating three things happen
first the game considers what your ideas are relative one another .
which quadrant you have the best chance to wind up in is determined by the proportions of your ideas .
second it uses the value of the relevant idea along with a second roll to determine where within that category you 've fallen .
third and finally the impartial '' aspects of your roll are considered .
your luck your level as well as the quality of your core crystal is factored in .
rolls are nudged higher a certain amount depending on each .
when a unique is taken the slot is given to a standard .
some blades just require improbable luck others require a maxed or near maxed idea alongside a high roll .
and since everything is divided into categories ... yeah .

hey guys i was wondering if the things the albums make us feel have anything in common .
in particular if we associate them to the same or different emotions .
so here are mine i am not a big fan of the taylor before speak now so i 'm gon na skip fearless and taylor swift
i love how genuine she is at times even naive .
you always say it 's the lyrics that make this album so great and i claim it is their purity that 's so outstanding .
although i love it this album has one of the most depressing vibes .
probably it is all too well that provokes this and despite the positive songs here it gives an impression of not being needed anymore but being self-sufficient .
it was her greatest success itself but it 's also its vibe that communicates this feeling .
the songs are confident no doubt everything is precisely measured perfection .
probably that 's why it 's never been a favourite of mine because of this perfection .
clean is the only trace of a ‘flaw ' and that 's why i love it .
that people change that only a few will only stay till the end .
but unlike speak now it tells truths not about taylor but about the world we live in .

i 've been using etherdelta with no problem except being god-awful slow .
i deposited a large sum of ether to my wallet this evening then proceeded to transfer it to my smart contract .
10 minutes later half of my ether arrives in my wallet .
and as i 'm sitting there refreshing and trying to figure out where the other half went another .15 ether disappears .
of course i start freaking out and immediately transfer it back to my wallet and the hell out of ether delta .
when i checked etherscan i can see all of the ether was clearly transferred to be smart contract and it never left .
but i know for a fact that only half of it arrived in my smart contract .
i 've left a small amount of ether in my wallet just to see why would happen and it 's still there .
if this was a hack why is n't there a trail showing my ether leaving my smart contract and going somewhere else ?
it 's as if it simply disappeared into thin air .
i hate to say it but it 's almost as if i 've been robbed by etherdelta .
i knew the exchange had gotten shitty but this is insane .
recently i purchased an i7 7700k along with the corsair hydro series h100i v2 .
i installed the two parts along with thermal paste and expected some high performance with considerably low temperatures .
though i did get high performance my temps are higher than i thought .
here they are idle 25-35c medium load 40-60c stressed 65-80c are these temperatures normal for my processor if not what can i do to fix it ?
if gaming what kind of performance are you looking for ?
1080p to begin with and moving into 1440p soon build wo n't change when i pick up a 1440 display .
obviously 60fps for now but 1070ti should be more than good enough for that even at 1440p .
i am unsure on the cooler the vendor i wish to purchase from would prefer to make one order seems very limited on coolers including aio 's as i do n't currently wish to spend too much on either the case or cooling as future will contain a new case and custom watercooling hence the cheaper case and cooler
if it 's allowed this is the vendor i am going with https www.playtech.co.nz any cooling solutions would be really appreciated preferrably ones in stock as i am looking at ordering tonight/tomorrow
the reason for building now and waiting to do the case/watercooling is that i need a new build as my current one is many years old and i am sick of running games on low if they even run at all so i am grabbing the parts to use until i have more time to sit down and research/build a better case .
on one last note i have heard some bad things about cx power supplies but that was the 2015 ones ?
this one should be the 2017 black i think ?
model but would still listen to any input saying it 's not a wise choice .
we 're roommates and we play it a lot .
we 're both light level 300 but our connection is a strict nat type which stops us from talking with other people to start a raid or anything like that .
in short we ca n't play the raid because our connection with other people sucks .
me and him can only connect with each other .
is it still possible to get the best weapons in the game and get to light level 335 ?
i feel like today after grinding we kinda hit our max and it sucks .
do we just grind the nightfall strikes and stuff ?
if you guys have any advice i 'd appreciate it .
best buy universal iphone x mislead as unlocked http www.howardforums.com/showthread.php/1902819-best-buy-universal-iphone-x-mislead-as-unlocked
remember for a brief few days bestbuy sold at an extra 100 premium unlocked iphone x and then withdrew ?
turns out those iphones are n't technically unlocked they are universal meaning inactivated phones that will adhere to the device lock policy of the first inserted sim .
unlucky for me that i used it with t-mobile first and t-mobile unlike verizon has a device-lock policy for lte devices by default .
now t-mobile refuses the unlock it because the device is n't sold through them .

the whole story is amazing and eunice is an almost perfect character .
the moment near the end of the final episode where james stands up for alyssa and her inner dialogue pops up to say 'i love him so much ... ' pushed me over the edge into tears .
everything they went through was so screwed up but in that moment and especially with such pitch perfect delivery and timing my heart broke for the honesty and depth of the love of two broken souls .
bravo to the writers and the actors for shattering my heart to pieces .
i hope this story puts a few more eunices into the world and maybe helps a few jameses and alyssas accept that even and probably especially broken people deserve and can have love .

i signed up for an hsa for 2018 through my employer .
i was told that the contribution limit for an hsa account is 3450 for self-only and 6,900 for family .
when i finished setting up the account i am seeing this
i am not sure why my contribution limit is 6900 because my wife is not my insurance plan .
she has insurance through her employer and we do not have any dependents .
any idea why i am seeing family limit on my plan ?
should i be calling the hsa company to get this corrected ?
i want to study history and i am deciding if i should go to exeter a place in which i have many friends and the course has an extra 10 coursework i like coursework or if i should go to glasgow where i can save that £££ .
my partner and i both have help to buy isa 's which we opened in october however our budget now exceeds the £250k limit but is less than the £450k that the lisa offers .
i wanted to switch this to skipton 's cash isa since we expect to buy a house well within 5 years which you are generally expected to leave it in a s s isa or so i 've heard .
is it possible to open a new cash isa even though we have already opened one this tax year even if we transfer immediately and close the old help to buy isa ?
its better to buy cheaper 4gb card or 8 gb its better for the future ?
farcry 2 came out at the wrong time unfortunately when most people were n't craving a challenging and punishing shooter or any game in general .
however i loved it and would love to for a remaster like what activision did for cod 4 .
it had an immersive setting and a story with many layers and was one of the few games where you could honestly not say who were the evil characters and who were the good .
then yesterday they closed my ticket and said go to faq .
tried that and now it wo n't let me open a support ticket .
would be cool if i could throw them to distract enemies or toss them to see if the way forward is safe or not ...
i have some question and i need your wisdom .
i 've started to learn to code 12 weeks ago love it .
right now i focus on web developpement but at some point i want to learn other languages .
i like to think ahead and i 'm thinking to learn vim .
i aleardy use tmux and combine the two seem awesome !
the thing is has i 'm already currently learning some language so maybe it is not the best idea to learn vim on the top .
i mean the faster i learn it the better ?
my second problem is that i 'm using an azerty keyboard and it 's suck .
so i was planning to either switch to qwerty easy solution or learn the dvorak layout or maybe bepo if any french is reading .
witch one will do a nice combinaison with vim ?
i am mostly playing vs for my tr char i love the dreadnought helmet for my nc chars its the recon helmet so far .

so let me ask you what nc helmet ideally fitting well for most/all classes would you recommend ?
i 've just ordered some upgrades once everything arrives this will be my new build https uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/fnyfsj
my question is will it be worth getting liquid cooling such as the 100iv2 when oc'ing my cpu with all the new upgrades ?
currently the evo 212 works just fine with temps around 30c idle and up to 57c when gaming .
i appreciate that it might be better to ask this question once i 've installed the upgrades and checked temps but i would rather buy/build all my upgrades in one go .
i 've always settled for multi cannons on my ships and they have served me well thus far .
but as i like to spend a good amount of time in a haz rez site or high cz the ammo thing becomes an issue .
either i need to leave to restock or leave to mine sulpher nickel and iron to manually resupply .

i know where to find fujin tea ... ... ... ... ..it 's in the name .
i know where broo lives and drinks his tea it 's on the galaxy map .
i do n't need to do this trip 10 bloody times .
2 would have sufficed knowing that after this i have to build my rep with him .
then on top of that i need to source all the mats to have enough of a chance for a decent roll .
i just hope that this is one of the things that change in the impending update that the engineers is getting .

so now that the next hotfix is a couple of days away can we have a pdf or a text file explaining the keywords and priority of most mechanincs in the game ?
i play since the open beta and i find it a little bit frustrating not being able to see a detailed description of the game 's keywords .
i think that with the simplification of most of the cards it is a good time that we can get such a manual even implemented in the game 's main menu .
many would argue that it might be fun to try new cards without actually understanding per se what they are doing but in most cases it causes frustration and confusion .
i think that this would be a good direction both in attracting new players and help the deck building process .
currently i am taking cmps 183 web app 102 algor design 122 comp security
i take 122 since i really like harrison when i took 111 with him .
but since 111 has a lot of work i am thinking making 122 pass no pass or replacing it with a ge .
i failed 102 last winter with dimitris so i dont want to fail again .
for 183 i took 115 software dev with julig last summer and feel time is very cramped .
the more i think about the more i wanted to drop 122 so i dont overload myself and can focus more on 183 .
sure it 's nice to have the happy music play at the end but this is all we are playing for ?

i was planning to go on a little tour from vienna to budapest but it would be my very first tour outside of my home country so the logistics of it all still confuse me a little .
i would be leaving from rome by plane and i would be flying back from budapest .
what 's the best way for me to get my bike there and back ?
i 'm thinking i might have a few options at this point
buy a travel bag for my bike have it shipped from vienna to budapest then use it to transport my bike back home
have my bike boxed by my lbs bring it on the plane with me and do the same thing on the way back from budapest
again have my bike boxed by my lbs but have them ship it directly to vienna then find another store in budapest to have them ship it back to rome .
with the proper preparation the third option might be the one with less hassle i 'm just a little worried about how much it might cost me .
if i bring my bike with me on the plane it would cost approx 100 euros both ways but i have no idea how much it would cost to have my bike shipped internationally .
also if any of you have done this same route before when would you recommend going ?
i was thinking sometime in april but i 'm afraid it might be too early .

real news real problems in the world real memes that we had to be creative enough to come up with and keep rather than relying on the power of the world wide web to carry our ideas everywhere .
i hope you kids get your comeuppance so you will finally understand what a true meme is .
someday when the internet breaks down under the weight of its idiocy you shall finally come to understand what it means to create and maintain real memes .
until then you 'll just be the same old snowflakes that the older generation rightfully complains about .
recently i 've gotten into photoshop and have been teaching myself by trying to recreate effects i 've seen in other images .
sometimes however i 'll find images that i like and simply can not determine if they have been shopped or are natural .
what would be signs that i should look for to determine the difference ?
any advice when it comes to recognizing specific effects ?
so you would think they would list all their fees here https www.gatehub.net/fees .
however i 've just learned that is clearly not the case .
if you want to transfer in or out any other crypto like btc or eth you will be hit with pretty substantial deposit fees especially if you are using reasonably small amounts
i 'm using multiple other exchanges and i do n't think a single one charges a crypto deposit fee .
you have to dig deep into their site to find this page https www.gatehub.net/gateways/fifth .
then navigate to fee schedule '' and you can see they charge a ridiculous flat btc deposit fee of 0.00169 btc and 0.02618 eth .
conveniently they have no way to directly link to this fee schedule .
so at current prices its 25.68 flat fee for any btc deposit and 30.19 for any eth deposit .
not to mention .3 or .2 on each trade .
then an additional 1 withdrawal fee for bitcoin or a fixed 0.005 btc 76 .
hey thanks gatehub you are being generous and giving us free eth withdrawals .
i imagine this will likely change in the near future .
bottom line its disgraceful and shady that these fees are n't listed or disclosed on the main fee page linked in the gatehub footer https www.gatehub.net/fees
if the terrible reliability and website performance was n't bad enough these fees are the cherry on top .
i 'm moving my money out and into a respectable and transparent exchange asap .
update they are still disclosing 0 fees for eth deposits when you initiate a deposit as seen here https imgur.com/a/psizz .

over my last two streaks this and last totalled about 50 days
i met my partner and started a wonderful relationship .

anyway i 'm currently trying to reach a 90day no orgasm streak .

managed to stop most of it with pelvic floor muscles and breath work but a bit still came out .
would you consider this a reset to my streak ?
also which sub reddits would you suggest for sexual health ?

memories where fifa was actually a game built to be played for fun .
it 's a shame to see how it 's progressed .
before this faint recollection of events pass from my memory i thought i 'd share an interesting happening i experienced on a nitrous oxide binge .
during my new year 's eve celebration my friend and i decided to go through as many whippits as we could throughout the entire night along with a bit of marijuana my friend had .
as the night progressed more and more no2 cartridges piled up in a heap as we both continued to get higher and higher with each balloon .
i got so high in fact that at one point that while i was inhaling a balloon while standing up i completely dissociated from the present reality and fell face first into the floor .
knocked over a couple things on the way down but thankfully nothing was broken .
needless to say i lowered my nitrous intake from then-on for the rest of the night .
while the night of nitrous-binging in itself was very enjoyable there was one memory throughout the night that stuck out .
while inhaling my 30th or 40th whippit i ca n't remember i was sitting on my friend 's couch in a deep trance listening to glowed up by kaytranda featuring anderson paak .
during the second half of the song if you 've listened to it you 'll know what part i mean i felt this unusual connection '' to the music as if i understood why the writer of the lyrics and the producer of the instrumentals made it as it is .
it felt as if i understood '' it in a weird dissociated state of mind .
i would have been able to decipher it more if nitrous lasted more than a fucking minute lol

black/interracial children adopted in the first 12 months of life to be 110
some 20 points above the average iq for black children being reared in the
children scored on average below the birth children of these families .
was true not only for black/interracial adoptees but also for white and
we interpreted these data to indicate that a putative genetic racial differences
do not account for a major portion of the iq performance difference
between racial groups and b black and interracial children reared in the
culture of the tests and the schools perform as well as other adopted children
the personality and social adjustment of the parents biological offspring
and adopted children ages 4-12 in these families was on average quite

interestingly it possibly affirms the genetic role of iq but it seems to strongly oppose the race realist position .

ideally i 'd want a heavy glass base with a simple perc and s femle joint for a tube connector.. then i could use it as a desktop vape without worrying about knocking it over
2017 has been a rough year for me and i want to change things for the better this time around .

i wake up monday friday for work at 7:50 to be at work by 8:30 .
i find a lot of mornings i 'm really lazy and end up hitting snooze a lot from 5-15 minutes which makes me late for work .
my body hates getting up when the alarm goes off .
i 'm wondering if i should start setting a second alarm way earlier that way my body can start to get ready to get out of bed .
that way i can lay in bed extra time before i have to actually get up .
is this a bad idea or would it be ok to do for my body ?
why do we still have a ban on uranium mining and nuclear power ?
the decision was made in cold war era to ban it by people in rural communities .
in fact they do n't exist and the cold war has been over for a generation .
we have gold ca n't touch it because you might see uranium .
ca n't touch it because you might see uranium .
well clearly it 's better to buy that from venezuela .
we good paying jobs to keep people here and we ban literally the only reason that saskatchewan has a booming economy because ussr was scary 30 years ago .
those rural folks must be in their 80 's by now .
they 're dying off and/or will be dead in 10 years when ns goes bankrupt .
how about we fix this problem and stop legislating against the future ?
it might even check some of those ivany report boxes .
its no secret that star citizen is gaining alot of money with the high prices for ingame content like the ships its actually hard to call these microtransactions because most of them cost more that aaa games .
they already said that ships will be bought by ingame credits but i can see they want to delay this feature in order to earn more cash .
once this feature is in the game will the ships still be available for real money ?
would they only include a price to permanently buy a ship ?
do you think these would be possible or only buying ships forever ?
another question you 'll have to buy insurance for your ships if you f.e .
have a 3 months insurance does it count as 3 months from start 90x 24hours start when online or 90x 24hours start when ship spawn ?

looking for advice that 's likely been posted a ridiculous amount of times .
our 3 year old does n't want to use the potty .
she knows when she has soiled her diaper she does n't always tell us .
she usually tells at night around/at bedtime when she is upset that she has to go to bed and is looking for anyway to stay up .
she is ridiculously advanced for her age has been since she was 2 counting and knowing all her abc .
the doctor says wait till she is in school and see if being around other kids helps .
if it does n't the doctor suggested we start psychology for her .
i 'd like to not have to keep changing our 3 year olds diapers for possibly 8 more months .
today we are trying again gave her a glass of water and sat her on the kids potty chair we have .
put her in underwear and keep asking if she needs to go she keeps saying no .
she was standing at the end of our bed when she turned around super fast and said i got ta go poop ! ''
i picked her up lightning fast and ran to the bathroom and put her on the potty ... she now says she ca n't poop ...
i told her if she poops she can have a reward .
when i ask her why she does n't use the potty i always get the response i do n't want to i do n't like it '' .
we have tried all the you will get a toy ! ''
i know positive reinforcement is good and read everywhere you should n't punish .
i am willing to be positive about it but i believe and some point it needs to stop if it is n't working and being stern and harsh needs to come in .
i want her to understand that it 's fine if she does n't want to do something but she is going to have to do things she does n't want to .
so has anyone done or heard of parents trying the nice positive approach with no avail then switching to a harsher approach and being successful ?
edit i now know offering a diaper was a bad idea lol .
poly-ceramic materials are composites of heat resistant and flexible plastics that contain hundreds of small ceramic plates .
originally created in 2215 these materials were designed as a light kind of infantry armour that could easily withstand small arms fire .
compared to contemporary armours at the time that contained steel titanium or even full ceramic plating within armours poly-ceramic armours are considerably lighter and more flexible .
originally designed by armistice arms inc. a subsidiary arms company working within the administration of navigators these new poly-ceramic armours took the military world by storm for over 10 years before the deigns leaked onto the civilian market place .
these infantry armours are not as durable when compared to steel-ceramic armoured used by war pyramids and armoured vehicles but still retain a high level of protection for users without costly compromise .
so common is it now to use poly-ceramic armours for spacesuits that even modern civilian space suits use it although to a much lesser degree then any of the professional military forces across the local cluster .
older prototypes for such a kind of poly-ceramic armour had ground up ceramics mixed into the plastic mixture these however proved be be inefficient and expensive when compared to layers of ceramic plates within the mix .
some people have compared these armours as to being modern versions of scale plating armour used by ancient armies but in reality the small size of each plating makes them much more flexible and when layered enough times to produce a single proper layer of armour are largely indistinguishable from flat layer of metal .
most modern military space suits use two layers of poly-ceramic armour for their body armour the divinity of hek however uses three layers for their armour .
i personally really enjoy the look of tobi kadachi .
he reminds me a lot of nargacuga and gives the thunder element for his weapons .

what do people think is the driving factor between arkham horror and eldritch horror ?
most people i 've spoken to seen to think eldritch is a better game '' but arkham has significantly more flairs .
is this just a matter of how many more people have had access to arkham over the years ?
or if there something about it such that if you do happen to like arkham more it is much more likely to be your favorite game ?

packs came from the the same stack in the box

i think that ny cosmos would have had an easy path to mls had the mls/nasl thing happened but that 's all speculation .
they did n't rush through nycfc for no good reason .
the cosmos were invited to apply to mls before they joined the nasl .
do n't get much easier a path than that .
not sure that mls really rushed through '' nycfc since mls had ny2 '' as it was then called was in the planning since at least 2006 seven years before nycfc was announced .
however you also ca n't blame the owners of the ny cosmos for not wanting to be stuck in minor league purgatory with rbny ii and the rest of usl .
they had ambition ... ... and as of right now it 's failed .
and the usl 's move is looking all the smarter because of that failure .
but it seems as though the ambition was rather short-sighted wanting everything immediately rather than accepting half-steps now and working for the rest in the future .
the nasl could have accepted a working partnership with mls taken the league 's money used that to create a stable base of viable clubs and broken off when they were strong enough to stand on their own .
these folks are either completely brainwashed or being paid .
except there was n't an invasion just air support for a ground insurrection .

i think people need to seperate when zlatan is joking around and having a bit of banter and when he is being serious .
as an immigrant in another country you will always experience some racism '' i dont think thats the right word .
id like to see the rest of this interview though does anyone have the link ?
it would be very interesting if he goes on describes what has led him to this .
also i love all the people that are commenting saying the media loves him do you read all the stories about zlatan ?
your perception is that the media is adores him but who can actually say they 've seen or read all the stories about zlatan .
there is no need for him to say these things unless he truly feels that something is happening
i look at him while i put my stuff in an empty bed .
i have n't introduce myself yet because so far you have been rude and annoying .
i will introduce myself once you find your manners. i jump to my bed and look at him .

of course i would suggest you move over when you feel it is something for you .

the issue is in fact that there is not enough competition in the us isp market largely because the big isps bought up all the small ones .
in fact the uk has less competition it is just better at pretending that it has competition .
the uk had until relatively recently only one state owned phone provider and that was bt which was state owned the biggest monopoly that you can get .
when private companies were permitted to enter the market bt and all the copper infrastructure was still owned by the government .
they then privatised bt and eventually split off the infrastructure side of the copper network in to a separate quasi private company called open reach .
open reach then serviced all the private isp and treated bt as another private isp .
then we had cable isps enter the market to compete with the open reach infrastructure in some areas .
we are only now seeing very limited fiber to the premises infrastructures being deployed in a few limited regions .
they could justify the common carrier because it used to be state owned .
so you are complaining about a lack of competition but the uk has a fake competition because all the isp are priced exactly the same and operate on the same infrastructure .
they ca n't do upgrades or offer faster speeds than their competition .
they have to wait for open reach to upgrade .
this is less competition than the us where there is several isps with different infrastructures competing .
sure a lot of the time they do n't overlap but that is a practical limitations .
in the uk we basically have one copper infrastructure and one cable infrastructure cable used to be owned by a few companies but virgin bought ntl and merged cable .
lets face it copper infrastructure is near reaching its end of life and that is why bt has moved in to wireless .
my hope is on fiber infrastructure being deployed by another company but like in the us they struggle to get the rights to use open reach existing poles and drain systems .
because open reach is still basically a part of bt and bt is like a huge quasi private company in bed with the regulatory bodies .
they wo n't allow for example google to come in and deploy fiber to the premises using their ducts .
so you see it is not much different than the us in many ways .
the us of course does not have a government monopoly and has a much more diverse tier 1 network than the uk .
bt actually own several other large isp in the uk and now even own a major mobile phone network .
this is very similar to the us as well in that isp own mobile networks and tv and other types of companies
net neutrality never set out to increase competition or reduce monopolies and would not have that result .
just to help here this is not a confirmed deal !
eyeignite is trying out with secret at the moment at the hypercup and dreamhack tournaments !

that was when trump talk was escalating about firing him .
he pretty much said stfu we got so much stuff on you so you better not f this up or it 's worse for everyone .
ok so there are 2 ways you can play the plane one is a traditional high altitude bomber and the other is high speed mid to low altitude bomber .
high altitude tends to be a safer play style as not much can get to you without burning a bunch of energy chasing and the fact that your a jet with a massive set of boost means when this happens you can actually outrun many fighters at t8 heavy fighters not so much .
upside you live longer with out much threat of interception .
downside you tend to be at such an altitude you wont be going fast unless diving towards a target .
this is further compounded with how often targets you are dropping on are taken out by ga 's
mid-altitude bombing is a playstyle of the crazy and insane it just happens to work .
the idea is you find your attack line on a target or targets where you can lay out all three charges in quick order then zoom away .
if any tries to follow you use your rear gun to make them cry and you burn away .
upside more likely to break 400 cp and get more xp and money downside you are way more vulnerable .
if you break into my house and sleep in my bed you will regain full strength and nobody will question this at all .

the other day i woke up in the middle of the night after having a nightmare that they jumped out .
sure enough when i walked to the tank room i heard them splashing around luckily still in their tank but trying not to be .
though one of them keeps trying to make a break for it and keeps getting scratched up on the filter when he rams into it ' .
the only way for them to be considered truth is to be written by a white whistle so it would be a logical reason to pretend to be lyza .
also she never mentions that it 's addressed to riko riko just assumes it 's to her .
i think one of the key products/features many other card games take advantage of that hearthstone seems to actively avoid is selling relatively cheap pre-made theme/starter decks .
they are a core part of the friendly new/casual player experience .
offering theme decks provides multiple vital functions for the overall health of a collectible card game and in doing so helps new players start an otherwise prohibitively expensive and unapproachable business model .
pre-made decks allow for pre-made only formats where both new and old players alike are given a space to compete on an even playing field .
this avoids the 'pay2win ' criticism and to be honest it 's good for both the new and veteran players to feel challenged .
this also means players can introduce their friends to the game painlessly and peer pressure/word of mouth/friend recommendation are the best forms of marketing .
pre-built decks lower the starting barrier to entry allowing newer/casual players to experience the 'feel' of a particular set without feeling left out or pressured into overspending just to achieve a basic deck at the mercy of rng packs is a sustainable way of gaining and keeping players over periods of years .
pre-built decks offer a 'safe space ' where players can experiment at their own pace till they feel comfortable experimenting with their own custom creations .
something hearthstones ranked/causal modes fails at completely hearthstone 's matchmaking for new/casual players seems like it 's the worst thing they can do literally throwing uncompetitive collection players to the wolves within the first couple of hours of gameplay
game designers can benefit from knowing what key cards exist in sets ahead of time and can design multiple heavily curated pre-built decks which provides a mechanism that gives players a reliable means of obtaining core cards not at the mercy of rng .
this allowing players easier access to core cards meaning casual players have more freedom to experiment/hunt down other cards after they have the basic building blocks for the set
there is some very limited cross coverage since many flu vaccines have somewhar similar antigens but for the most part you 're correct .
more specifically since the vaccine is made in fall researchers predict the top three influenza strains which are most likely to become an epidemic with some consideration for cross coverage .
the standard flu vaccine is then a combination of three vaccines one for each of those strains .
many of the worse flu outbreaks occur because the epidemic strain was not correctly predicted and is not covered by vaccines .
for this reason there 's some ongoing research on universal or at least broader flu vaccines .

indeed under the medicare advantage '' plans that 's exactly how they make their money .
they get 200,000 seniors in a state to sign up .
the seniors sign over their medicare benefits to humana .
so if you fall and break you hip say medicare would pay maybe 50,000 for the surgery and hospital stay .
humana however has gone around to the hospitals in that state and told them you can sign a contract with us to accept the amount we 'll pay you for a hip surgery and if you do n't agree we 'll take our 200,000 customers and go to your competitor we 'll run you out of business .
so the hospitals and doctors and therapist and anyone else in the medical field have to sign these advantage '' contracts .
you break your hip get the surgery recover medicare gives humana 50,000 and humana pays the hospital 15,000 and keeps the other 35,000 as profit .
the hospital would be much better off working with medicare .
hospitals already negotiate how much they should be paid by medicare and they accept it .

one of the stretches i would do is make small controlled circles with one finger at a time on your hand .

this helps define your muscles in your carpal region which is helpful if your hand has been in a cast for awhile .

well i think watching porn is an actual problem .
however i agree that not masturbating is really not doing anything productive .
the biggest problem i see in the nofap community is the mentality .
that negative self-defeatist attitude where they feed their self perpetuating cycle of anger shame guilt etc .
if they stopped attaching negative mindsets to the act of masturbating most of their problems would go away .
they are attaching negative feelings to sexual pleasure so when it comes time to have sex with a woman those negative feelings in their subconscious will start to work against them .
i do n't see a problem with masturbating the vast majority of the male population do it and still lead healthy sex lives .
but when you masturbate you need to drop the bullshit attitude and just fucking own it .

indeed patrick troughton was instrumental in making the show the long-term success we can enjoy today .
maybe the tt2013 found it and started mashing the down arrow rather than growing a pair and replying .
i 'm with you here better have a solid game engine and different signals the path signals for 99 of signalling and entry/exit/combo for priority than smooth corners and curved bridges in a game where the pathfinder that ca n't find its ass without waypoints .
also the game is 20 years old or at least the underlying graphics set is and if we introduced things like smooth corners/switches and 16 or 24 views for vehicles instead of 8 we could n't use the graphics sets any more .
at some point we 'd have to reinvent rather than patch the game .

what 's to say they did n't put it there though ?
when you 're influential media entity and you do this you 're basically endorsing the leak regardless of whether they had a hand in it or not .
the only thing doing this does is promote people pirating it which will in turn mean it will have a loss in sales .

i used him in a game on saturday but since i have only one he became a huge target priority for my opponent that had first turn .
he drop poded a sternguard squad with all meltas and got lucky with his rolls and managed to take off almost all the wounds and finished off the tank with focused fire from a stormhawk interceptor .
he also managed to shoot down my stormraven which also exploded and the on board death company dreadnought was slain when i rolled a one to see if he survived .
we played another game right after where the repulsor survived 'till battle round 4 but my opponent seized and got first turn again and managed to take off enough wounds on the repulsor to make the stats deprecate and me getting a bs of 4 before my first turn .
the repulsor managed to do a lot of damage but i still want to play a game where he has full health and can wreak havoc from first turn .

well nope i am a guy and my friends buy me drinks so i can afford to come out .
but the sanity issue is doing her no favours .
i was expecting her to accept the need to reset at the end of the arc .
based on zeus reset immortals are quite detached at best even though they might grow in accepting their vows and knowledge over time .
zeus does n't consider himself jerry although jerry can use proper reset to ensure zeus retains some lessons .
this worse by a few degrees but maybe neo pandora might retain some fractured info as well as her base nature being sweet .
she 's probably a pain proper reset or not but not completely dead .
it 's more her current self having limited time for closure that is the tragedy .

taste is not the only reason but perhaps meat flavored alternatives with high nutritional value can eventually be substitute .
the only thing to keep in mind is that you will progress slower than most players .
it is not like you are playing a completely different game .
you just need to have the right mindset and understand that things are going to take time .
you may want to consider switching both dps to archer though .
also use engage to make them kill heavy hitters .
zu 's hit like a truck so do avis they also do a aoe that distracts your healer .
i usually do the elemental packs one at a time .
since 2 archers will pull tons of hate the last thing you want happening is something going after one .
when that happens they take damage and the healer switches off you .

this is lavar playing the long game he wants to create uneasiness about walton 's development skills so when lonzo inevitable does n't develop into a super star cause he was never properly coached his entire life because of daddy ball he can blame walton which also 's allows lonzo to get at least another contract and a new grace period under a new head coach .
it would have been better had he actually done it and declared himself the owner of the oil rig instead of announcing his plan to start !
i do n't like them the handle is too far away from the centre of gravity .
i guess you 're also right in that i should try to look back and cherish the memories instead of sulking over it.. it just sounds like it 's sort of that thing where whenever i look back it makes me wonder just how much more we could do together again

for the practice tests mark each question you got wrong and research why you got the wrong answer just simply taking the exam and seeing if you pass or fail is a waste of time .
if you have a pc you can tinker with it and gain hands on experience in doing some troubleshooting windows installations etc as just studying a book and memorizing acronyms is not the best way to learn .
in that case know of any mods to increase the chunk loading distance or something of that nature ?
i 'm only able to find texture packs that render from further away which is n't really the issue here .

if so that mindset is too because of your weed usage ... and you can be carefree and positive sober even to a greater level than with any substances and of course healthy .
can i advice that you do excercise/meditation for a month or so but without any replacement drug just see how it goes without any substances ... if it does n't work then find something to take but after a month or so you can actually realize that you do not need anything you can lost that desire .

i can recommend using downshift https github.com/paypal/downshift for this it 's an autocomplete textbox that does exactly what you 're describing .
i used it to trigger backend calls whenever the user typed and then display the results as dropdown items .
it 's not like they would be hard to find and get rid of though .
we are pretty good at decimating trees and its not like they would be able to grow faster than we could account for .
grasses vines and such would definitely be a lot harder to get rid of though .
yeah i hate the fact that he 's not dark at allll .
it 's like they saw him being suave in the comics and thought that was his default personality .
really surprised to see how little attention this one is getting .
i guess the name makes it sound a bit generic .
it also seems like a lot of people do n't quite understand how it works .
developers use them to purchase ad campaigns for the apps they publish .
the campaigns work by paying users for trying the apps .
users can then use their appcoins to make in-app purchases throughout the ecosystem i.e .
on any app store that adopts the appcoins protocol .
this is a genuinely great idea and will benefit new app developers tremendously .
it 'll also be great for people who do n't have access to credit cards and developers who want to serve those people because it will give them a way into the app economy .
finally appcoins was developed by aptoide one of the largest third party android app stores so it 'll have a huge user base right off the bat .
i would n't be surprised to see this in the top 100 by the end of the month .
i think the devs do n't know where the error is so that 's why we dont see any answers .
pushing the dlcs is more important to finally cut off bf1 .

i 'd go for syklops it feels more serious .
well we see but one thing is for sure holgate got away with what was blatant red card possible further punishment considering both the player and fans could of been seriously hurt and has deflected any media attention in regards to the foul .
i 'm going to make a conjecture that part of the reason this is occurring is that exchanges like binance/bitfinex/bittrex have temporarily suspended new account creation .
there are a lot of newcomers that are attempting to hop on the new altcoin craze .
given that these exchanges are the primary gateways to many altcoins new users have no choice but to stock up on their ether from a service like coinbase thereby increasing ether 's price .
furthermore the current lack of open channels for new users to spend their ether has perhaps contributed to the rise in ether and corresponding drop to other alts .
just a theory but at this point it does n't seem too farfetched .

i remember reading that once you find a resource it is marked on your map .
i believe the demo also had pretty much all the nodes marked as well and they never really changed as far as i could so take that for what you will .
you can store the selected city id in two places
the first option is simpler to implement but the second one is usually a requirement for many web apps .
change your model to store the select city as a maybe because when no city is selected you can set is as nothing
in your view function check if the selected city is set to something
in your button to select the city you can adjust the event to fire a maybe value
i prefer to fire just the id to avoid duplication of truth .
it is safer to filter the city later than to update the info in two places .
the second approach which involves routes has a longer implementation .
you can read about it in the routing section of this tutorial https www.elm-tutorial.org/en
it 's more of a collectable and to be part of history
future finance is an option for loans for students that operate much more like a regular loan rather than an slc loan .
i believe this becomes payable back upon graduation and might require a guarantor .
not suggesting this is the best option just an option .

the latter explains the icepack over his eye when he was on the bench .
knowing the situation he took a knee in order to give his backup time to prepare .
personally i see nothing wrong with that bit of gamesmanship .
he was n't faking an injury to slow down a hurry up offense which is a tactic that goes against the spirit of the game .

better yet if you are paying down debt still you can include the cashback as part of your payment effectively reducing your minimum payment freeing up a little more cash flow to put toward higher interest debt .
i 've yet to see another card where you can apply the cashback directly to the minimum payment like that .
of junk which is just ridiculous for a road bike and a result of it being made out of low-grade chinesium and scaffolding pipe offcuts not literally but you get what i mean that 's more than most downhill racing mtbs that look like this https ep1.pinkbike.org/p5pb14585294/p5pb14585294.jpg weight and more than twice what higher end road bikes weigh .
i have a road bike from 1985 that cost significantly less than that gmc that is 16lb lighter .
am a little confused as you say hybrid in the title but the denali is a road bike .
i would not recommend any bike from amazon go to a real bike shop .
at the end of the day 400 cad just is n't a realistic budget for a new bike that is n't an overpriced garage decoration unless you luck out and find an ex-demo bike at a shop that 's heavily marked down .
otherwise the absolute minimum would be 500 for something like a norco vfr4 or giant escape 3 and 650 is more like a reallistic minimum for a bike used for commuting and not casual recreational use e.g .
the vfr3 or the escape 2 these are the level of bikes generally recommended to people to look to start commuting .
the other option would be to screw the company benefits and buy a used bike that will be much cheaper but some shitty amazon bike will just be a waste of time and money even if it 's not your money and leave you in a worse spot than now as you still do n't have a good bike for commuting but no longer have company benefits to help get one .
i mean a decent creepypasta can be decent but keeping them short is key .
honestly i still like this one https www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3azru6/i_found_a_small_box_hidden_in_a_mall_that better known as yuri.chr '' .

actually there 's a lot more than you would think in the dairy industry .

ok sure granted a death-in-office scenario your terrifying version of a pence presidency certainly could become reality ... but highly unlikely what-if situations like that just are n't relevant or productive to get into right now
when you near end of the bloody baron questline .
a cutscene occurs that uma breaks into baron 's room while he was talking to geralt and is then dragged back by some henchman .
at that point they do n't suspect it to be human but the baron talks about something being strange with him .
later after skjall tells geralt and yennefer what happened they suspect uma might be ciri or at least the key to finding her .

i 'm a plat 3 mid main and i 'm very serious about improving .
i want someone to work with long time because i really enjoy this game .
my eventual goal is challenger but saying that really seems like a stretch so what i really want to do is improve myself as a player to the point where i can get to that level .
i know that this is no easy task but i 'm not expecting it any time soon either and i 'm in virtual school at the moment so i have the time to dedicate as well .
i 'm not squeamish when it comes to criticism and i try to not focus on rank and take every game as a learning experience and watch my own replays and high elo vods to try to gain knowledge from every source possible .
i 'd love to have someone help me improve as a player !
with more cryptocurrencies growing up everyday and miners use their cpu for those currencies instead of bitcoin .

i have so many subpar computers i do n't have much so i ca n't afford like a dream computer such as a carbon x1 with 16gb of ram haha .
so i 've got a bunch of subpar computers like this acer cloudbook 14 that when i saw it in walmart i was obsessed with the shape/profile of it but it 's absolutely garbage of a computer one of those intel celeron 32gb emmc types
i have another one just like that but it 's a transformer chromebook 2-1 table type but has an intel processor .
an 8gb maxed out desktop and an acer swift 3 maxed out at 8gb .
then 3 raspberry pis 2 always on doing their thing .
i just get this sense of only have 1 good computer '' except the pis i want those to be doing their things haha .
im still early in my transition i do n't even pass yet one of my friends quickly after coming out to him thinks of me as female and not in a forced or pandering way he actually sees me as a female and will refer to me as such instinctively it feels great and he really helps to validate my identity im soo happy to be friends with him .

hey guys i 'm doing a research for the university about the most popular skill games played in peru .
can you share what are the most played games in your country ?

they may include gambling or simply fun times beating your opponents .

i know it is possible to set-up a combination of something like

more than half of the existing coins of ripple are in the hands of the owners of the company .
would the owners decide to bring the coins to the market would the price drop down and would probably never recover .

everywhere i 'm reading all existing wikis and some discussions regarding this tool on various forums state that it simply adds a flat 80 damage so even if the target is highly resistant to arcane i at least should be seeing slightly more damage with each attack with a buffed weapon than with an unbuffed one .
however i 've just tried using it on mergo 's wet nurse for the first time and after trying it several times with different attacks of my threaded cane i 'm seeing lower numbers with all types of attacks when my weapon is buffed with eps .
the only logical explanation is that the arcane damage replaces the scaling skl damage which is in the 2xx 's for me already which results in the loss of 100 damage i 'm seeing however this seems to go against what 's written literally everywhere .
sure the shields are tiny and only protect the torso of nat but most attacks are automatically leveled on hostile com anyway and they just laugh at you when you forget your explosives butchering you once you start to reload 5 thunder shots times 2 at knife-fighting range equals doom even to durabots

on the morning of february 24th 1952 a steam train derailed just outside the town of anchieta while crossing the pavuna river sending wooden locomotive carriages onto the opposite track where one of our newest diesel-electric locomotives hit them running at full speed .
the scale of death is yet unknown because while many passengers inside the electric train suffered only minor injuries up to and including broken bones the wooden carriages were entirely destroyed and all within killed save for a handful of survivors .
the death toll was made worse by the fact that dozens of people had climbed onto the outside of the old wooden carriages because of a lack of seats inside .
one witness claims to have seen passengers flying in all directions when the crash occurred '' .
at the moment over 100 people are known to be dead with more bodies being uncovered as we speak .
presidente vargas is reportedly outraged at this demanding from his civil servants to know why the plans he put in place to modernise the railway systems in 1944 were not followed through by the dutra administration .
he has ordered estrada de ferro central do brasil to immediately upgrade all category red '' lines that they operate around 120 miles of track which are regarded by experts as highly unsafe '' .
he has further ordered the purchase of 200 new safer electric locomotives plus carriages and put in place a timeline for the phasing-in of more carriages on commuter railway routes .
the press decrying the slaughter on the railroad '' have wholeheartedly rallied behind the presidente who has directed his own office to oversee this project .
the presidente has also warned edfcdb that their continued disregard for the safety of brasilian workers their inefficiency and administrative disorganization '' may force him to ask the national congress for a nationalisation bill if they do not improve their record .
let me give you a briefing on what just happened .
the jelurida team tried to get in contact with the exchanges before the airdrop and main net launch .
now in a normal situation if there is a lack of communication you would delay the whole process before doing something important like this .
but the team did n't and they went ahead anyway .
so for a week ardr at bittrex were locked up all the while the tokens were trading at polo and hitbtc .
a lot of people tried to get in contact with jelurida during this time but they responded that resuming trading is something solely decided by the exchanges .
and then vague dates were thrown around like jan 1st jan 5th without clarification that it was n't definite .
about 3 days ago jelurida finally finds out that polo and hitbtc did n't support the snapshot .
i do n't know what the hell they were expecting and this in itself is crazy because everyone else knew that the tokens were trading on these two exchanges during the whole time .
making people wait for a week and then finding the problem and making us wait for an indefinite amount of time again is just fcking crazy and unprofessional .
if you do something like this in the real world at a real company you can be sure you are in for consequences .
i invested 200k in this and 100k in variety of other projects .
for the past two weeks ardr went up 50 while my other 100k became 700k .
so you get the kind of opportunity cost you are paying in this market .
i 'm not going to just panic sell everything i have like a schmuck i expect to see ardr get a decent pump since this is the only coin that stagnated while everything was going up two three folds .
but after that i 'm out and i 'm never touching ardr/nxt/ignis again .
there are way better projects with way better communication then this one .

a brief history the fury used to be a versatile option and pretty much the go-to upgrade for sundies .
it was mainly ai but dealt good damage to vehicles at closer ranges .
this also entailed a lot of use with it in repair sundy trains or blockade sundies in bases .
combined arms puts vehicles at a significantly higher risk against infantry
the last point is defining since the use of the fury has noticeably declined especially because other options are more capable at dealing with e.g .
even 'av ' or logistics sundies will probably run basilisk/ranger combo or the likes especially since furies are worse at dealing with armor at range or mobile harassers .
the fury deserves a minor buff to fully realize its adapted av role not in the form of damage but rather in the form of slightly higher velocity and less gravity .
the idea is essentially that improved velocity and less drop will expand the fury 's effective range and make it more capable at dealing with armor at range and potentially harassers with some accuracy .
this still entails the downside that is less suitable to deal with infantry especially light assaults but it would make the fury an alternative for sundies more likely to engage armor .
hi does somebody know of a good resource to learn more about sfp 's ?
i recently upgraded a long haul wan-link from 160km sfp 's to 210km but did not see any increase in rx-level obviously because tx-level just increased around 1db .
so what is the actually difference between 160km and 210km ?
i do thing i have read some place that the main difference is the rx sensitivity but i am not able to find where i have read it .
and if so by sensitivity does this mean that the e/o-module are able to generate a more «accurate» electrical signal from a weaker optical level ?
so back in the day i was on a forum which uses an old forum motor .
it was a community what i was in but now i dont want to associated with them .

last 3 years i wrote to the admin several times i would like to be deleted from that forum and from some topics but nothing happened .
the forum is still on and active and the only way to delete stuffs is to write the admin .
since nothing happened and bothers me that i was on it what can i do ?

while i could deal with this issue i constantly get the tsunami warning which is driving me crazy .

another is that would make as an interesting concept is ruby 's silver eyes powers to act like a more power yet more unstable version of the schnee 's summoning except instead of mere avatars of defeated foes she will summoning real beings like high and low rank grim or other that i have yet to decide on what would be great for world but there you are so what 's yours .

so as the title says i 'm trying to build a stronghold for a death knight and his league of evil warriors .
the death knight has a vault deep inside the lair that houses a large amount of gold and magic items .
my players are n't meant to encounter the death knight yet so he 's going to be out doing evil stuff when they go to raid the place .
i 'm planning on having some warriors and maybe blackgaurds as guards .
i do n't know what rooms to put in there to make it feel like a death knight and his company lives more like resides because he 's undead lol there .
i have an idea for the final vault but i have no clue for the other rooms in the dungeon stronghold .
i currently have a htpc that runs plex a bunch of newsgroup downloaders torrents etc .
it 's just a regular windows box that has been becoming more increasingly a pain in my ass with reliability and uptime .
it 's a amd kabini 5350 w a hodge podge of drives .
it serves my needs and i do n't see a need to upgrade the hardware .
i also have a desktop and a laptop but i 'm selling both and upgrading to just a new laptop .
my desktop also has like 4 more assorted drives from 200gb to 6tb .
my idea was to convert the htpc over to a freenas box and host all the hard drives and sit in the corner and just be storage and a plex server along with the newsgroup plugins that i see are available on freenas like sabnzbd and sickbeard/couchpotato and plex .
i do n't need any redundancy or anything fancy .
i just need reliable uptime and to be able to access all the drives on any of my devices a few roku 's pulling up plex my laptop and if possible id love drive access from my phones for viewing photos .
i read all the features for freenas but i 'm not 100 sure how it handles all the drives and if it pools the storage or if everything remains as seperate drives still etc .
how do i access all the drives from windows machines ?
i am currently taking 25mg of amitriptyline daily for tension headaches and other various pain due to spinal stenosis in my neck .
a few times a month i get extremely anxious for absolutely no reason and a dull to moderate headache begins usually on one side of my neck/temple .
my upper back neck and shoulders which are almost always tense and fairly painful get even more painful not sure if this muscle pain is related to the stenosis .
i get in some weird mood where i 'm extremely irritable anxious and depressed .
my emotions feel very dulled during this 2-4 day period .
the headache which is sometimes almost non-existent persists throughout the whole thing .
i can objectively see how irrationally angry and anxious i am being but i ca n't change it which really bothers me .
i am trying to figure out if this is some migraine related issue which causes the anxiety depression and dulled emotions or vice versa .
the amitriptyline keeps the pain down and reduces the tension headaches but does n't do anything for these episodes .
edit i 've tried sumatriptan and it did nothing .
we 're going to be installing wood floors soon and i need to buy tools for the project .
i noticed skill sells a flooring saw that does rip cuts and angle cuts on pieces up to 6 in wide and it still for only 150 .
while i think it 's really cool affordable and would absolutely suffice for the flooring i 'm concerned that it 's value would diminish after that .
whereas buying both a miter and table saw would be more of an upfront investment but allow me to do a lot more projects after that and i could even do cuts on the baseboard and door/window trim .
i 'd be looking at at least 500 for the two unless someone could recommend something cheaper .
so you think it would be worth it for me to get the miter and table saws for the flooring project or just use the skil flooring saw and use a miter box or coping saw for trim and baseboard ?

hey relatively new player here had a question i was hoping you could help with .
so i 'm currently the king of león and i have a weak claim on the kingdom of galicia because it used to be held by my uncle .
before i could declare war galicia was taken in a holy war by the astafid sultanate .
50 years later i still have the claim and even though i killed the sultan so his infant son ascended to the throne causing a regency i still ca n't press my weak claim .
i can press other claims that i or my vassals have and i can attempt to take galicia in a holy war but i would rather not because i do n't want every other muslim ruler in the area getting involved .
i do n't understand why i ca n't press the claim .
i 've searched on google and reddit and have n't found anything that quite parallels my situation .
my two main theories are that i ca n't press it because it 's currently under muslim rule and that it 's because there currently is no king of galicia they let the title die when they took it over .
again i 'm pretty new to the game so sorry if the answer is super obvious .
figured this would be a good place to ask this

hey saskatoon i need some recommendations for a good driving instructor to help me get my class 5 license .
i have my learners license and i completed the in class parts of high school driver 's ed .
i 'm 16 and i come to saskatoon once a week in the evenings and i 'm looking for a driving instructor with the best rates who has a fair amount of patience for someone who has never city driven only ever in a small town and i am quite comfortable doing so .
my small town only has one driving school and the instructor is an ass and stresses me out .
i basically just need to get 6 hours someone correct me if i 'm wrong of in car classes to get my completion certificate so i can go for my test .
all recommendations are welcome and if there is anywhere or anyone to avoid please let me know !

assuming that there 's no fighter pack 4 like some believe we are getting to the tail end of characters in injustice 2 .
we all wish there were certain characters who made it instead of those who did .
for example i wish amazo had made it in functioning similar to shang tsung or shinnok in his ability to copy powers and abilities and i wish constantine had made it in as a more in your face magic user unlike fate .
so i ask who do you wish had made it in the game or vice versa who do you wish had n't made it into the game ?

today i had 5 portal submissions available so i went to the street and took photos of some playgrounds in public parks i sent the 5 portals on different places however i did n't received any confirmation e-mail it was n't a network problem because i was playing normally and sending photospheres in google until i arrived home but i only received 4 portal confirmations portal 1 portal 2 portal 4 and portal 5 .
i thought it was in queue '' or something like that and i tried logging out to see if the pending portal submission '' alert popped but no the normal message popped up .
i tried force syncing but that portal submission does n't gets back also i logged out of my account again the pending portal submission '' message did n't appeared and after logged in and still nothing .
after i reinstalled the full app and it 's the same it counts as if i sent the 5 portals but still no confirmation email .
tldr today i sent 5 portals and i only received confirmation of 4 of them i tried logging in and out and even reinstalling the app but i still do n't get back my last submission

i just do n't know the path of achieving and completing these steps so to apply them in my overall goal of financial progress .
what are my options to advance my career away from retail management and educate myself into a position where i can choose a career path that is more fulfilling and financially secure ?
i am aware many people are on here trading tips on stocks putting away for retirement playing with amounts of money i do n't make in a year and that 's great i can strive for that but first and foremost my goal is to continue to feel stable on my feet as i currently feel that something like my car breaking down or substantial speeding ticket for instance would result in financial ruin .

my experience with questrade has been so frustrating last couples of weeks trying to open a non register account has been hell even though i have my register accounts with them .
i want to open a non register account and they keep rejecting my address document because my name which is to long and gets cut does not match my id name even the banks do n't give me crap for that .

we have a ton of boxes of junk in the basement .
unfortunately we have a ton of different types of boxes cardboard plastic some with lids some without .
this makes managing storage a pain because things do n't stack well .
i 'd like to reorganize the basement and buy shelving and a bunch of the same storage container .
my only restriction is that they need to be clear stackable and have a lid .
looking at amazon nothing sticks out as particularly nice .
i just downloaded nastradoomus and maddillainy and i was curious what else was available .
does anyone know if the labs start this week or next ?
i 've been looking for this book for about 8 years .
but i ca n't remember much about them except what 's below .
so i was aged 11 when i read these novels so 2007 .
just a note i 'm from new zealand not sure if that would make any difference .
the novels themselves i 'd say where maybe 100-200 pages long .
age it would be advertised for 9-12 year olds .
the books where a series i 'm pretty sure of it i 'm sure i read a few of these novels
basically a girl moves lives in a house and all i can remember is she meets some fairies .
one fairy is named ariella or maybe that 's the girls name .
i think some fairies had things to do with named after flowers seasons but not 100 sure .
i know that the girl had to chant/say something 3 times in order to turn into a fairy .
the chant was either i do believe in fairies x3 or i do believe in magic x3 .
i believe in one novel/scene/chapter she changed this whilst in her room and maybe flew out the window .
in one novel i remember that a neighbor had a black cat and turns out the cat is the neighbor lady and she was stealing souls or something and had the stolen souls floating around in an orb or something along those lines .
it may have been orbs floating around in a crystal ball .
i 've have tried and tried and tried to no avail to find this series of books .
i 'd be beyond grateful for anyone who may know this series .
it is not any of the rainbow magic series .

hi i want to sell an iphone 4 32gb black that has been used since the release .
it still runs like new but has a few scratches on the back .
i also want to sell a cooler master cm storm havoc gaming mouse that has been used for a year and is in a perfect condition .
i have been tasked with putting this sound care into an older pc i have restored .
at least that 's what looks like https www.generosity.com/sports-fundraising/help-the-jamaican-bobsled-team-reach-the-olympics 2
why are we not easily raising the 23,000 that is a drop in the bucket this time ... ok willing to donate but i do n't know how it was done last time ... anyone can help ?
maybe bring our founding father to help with this ?
so i was thinking back in the eea we lived in tribes .
you 'd be born into a tribe and you 'd be in it for your whole life most likely .
when you became a fledgling adult then it would be very important for you to be accepted by your tribe but also you 'd already be in it by default .
there would be plenty you could do to make people like and respect you less but you 'd have to do something really bad to be rejected by your tribe .
it would 've been really easy to be accepted by your tribe because you 're already one of them .
but in the modern day you 're no longer part of a tribe at all you 're just put in a school full of people you barely know .
then you still feel a really strong desire to be part of a tribe because it was really important but now it 's way harder because you have to find a tribe and get into it which is not necessarily that easy .
of course for some people it 's easy anyway but not all .
if i search in the apple app store it says it 's not currently available in the us store .
i'mma listen to marvin 's room and then pass out
this was my first real build and it 's something that i 'm proud of .

my girlfriend and i are planning on moving out to new jersey this for one of my optometry rotations this summer and we 're looking for a sublet .
my rotation is from late may to early august .
we have two well trained indoor cats i understand this complicates things .
1400 per month would be the maximum we could afford even that 's pushing it .
we 're pretty flexible on location and living arrangements so we do n't mind having roommates .
the location does n't even necessarily have to be in newark as there are about 5 sites around the area that i 'll be rotating to while i 'm in nj .
i 'm just looking for any suggestions on where to find short term housing .
are there any other reliable sites or local sites i should explore ?
thanks in advance for any help or advice you 're willing to offer !

i started the day with a 2016 rating and now i 'm down to 1955 after 7 games 4 of which were in the top 10
i noticed that i only received like 2 to 5 points from my last 2 games 4 and 7 rating went up from 1953 to 1955 but i got deducted like 50 points after i died in 72 from the 2nd game it 's frustrating as hell
here are my ranks from the last 7 games according to my replays 11 72 19 8 5 7 4
why did my ratings dropped 60 points i know the 72 and 19 would definitely chop down my ratings but i barely recovered any points from the last 4 games

my fiancee says she really does n't mind only having one bridesmaid so that the bridal party is even but i feel awful and am kind of freaked out at how this wedding made me realize how relatively small my support network is .

this is part of the reason straight couples tend to resort to adoption instead of considering adopting as a first choice
straight couple i knew spent 30k on ivf unsuccessfully before going for adoption and adoption itself was an extraordinarily difficult journey .
everything about them was scrutinized to the point where they were soliciting friends to write testimonials for them about what great parents they 'd be .
they finally did get to adopt a baby but it took several years .
these problems also happen on the other exchanges during high traffic days
downloaded the update and both missions still end on the 17th and the camouflages are nowhere to be seen .
alright here 's another dumb follow-up ... what are your portrayals '' of the characters ?
it sounds like all these interpretations '' you 're doing are en masse and it might be easier for me to understand where you 're coming from if you gave me a list of all these personal changes .
on a side note i 've only ever played 7,8,13,14,15 warriors and part of 6 and 11 so honestly i do n't have entire knowledge of everything fe
i 've personally found there are two types of people that play dnd regularly and make it a hobby actors and act-ers .
actors are more concerned with things like alignment for their character and other things like backstory and what not .
they will choose an alignment and then act out how the character would respond to the stimuli they are given .
they are interested in exploring a world through the lens of a person that is not them .
for actors alignment is there to guide their thoughts and motivations .
act-ers are more concerned with doing things than necessarily roleplaying a character because essentially the character is them .
in your example young people usually fall into this category because they want to play a game not explore higher concepts like morality .
for act-ers alignment is there to justify their actions .
at the end of the day though alignment is really there for the actors to give them a basis from which to adjust their normal thinking pattern in regards to how they want to play their character .
an act-er might say they 're lawful evil '' but that mean something entirely different to them than an actor because they 're not using it as a means to ground themselves in a character .
act-ers do it because it sounds neat or fits the image of the character in their mind .
it 's who they want to see themselves as not who they want to portray .
it 's not a hard and fast rule that locks every character into a specific choice .
when it was created alignment was not designed to be some kind of moral compass it informed you what side you were on .
if you lawful good you were aligned with the forces of good and law .
if you were chaotic evil you were aligned withe forces of chaos and evil .
good evil law and chaos were not imaginary concepts or ideas they were real forces in the world akin to a religion that even had their own language .
it was not there to say that someone that was evil could not do good '' things or that someone who was good could not do evil '' things .
things have changed a lot since then and people 's focus on alignment should as well .
for 'older players ' we remember when alignment was an important part of the game but that 's not how it is anymore .
for 'millennials ' all they have is a blurb in this book and they wonder why some people make such a big fuss about it .
at the end of the day actors and act-ers will use alignment how they will and that 's their choice not anyone else 's .
one post is concerned with them making it public .
another is concerned they did n't go to police .
another is concerned that they made an issue of it at all because they are caretakers .
when would it be appropriate with someone in this setting ?
what is the manner that you would have thought ok i agree with how they did this ? ''
if the answer is none at all '' that is an issue .
i have n't looked it up '' why do people insist on saying these things about the dprk when they admit they do n't even know what they 're talking about
lightning fees may be minimal but the on-chain transaction fees are significant !
i mean that having a good reputation is only good for having lots of connections and therefore being able to claim a lot of ln fees but since they are minimal a big payday from a fraudulent close even taking into account on-chain fees may be worth years of fees making burning your node reputation an acceptable loss assuming your node is anonymous .
but then in that world we would n't need lightning in the first place
yes we would because it adds privacy and near-instant payments as well as atomic cross-chain swaps and atomic money-for-data swaps .
the cwl is a joke when compared to cs or lol or even overwatch .
it feels more and more each year that it 's nothing but another form of advertising to activision and they could give two shits about cod esports .
they probably see it as a good way to reach the younger audience which let 's face it probably makes up a huge number of cod competitive fans due to optic being the org it is .
which to them is a huge deal because these kids will play the game in hopes of becoming a pro and will most likely spend money on microtransactions .
wwii has some of the worst weapon balance i 've seen in a cod .
and by that i mean every gun feels like an inaccurate pea shooter .
nothing is fun to use besides smgs and even then they feel like lmgs because of the slow sprint up time .
af will need more than a few thrashers to take it alongside better time zone coverage .
i 've tried drinking it very diluted in juice because a friend read it might help my arthritis .
i get sooo many suggestions from well-meaning eager people who want to help and while i usually say thank you so much i 'll look into it coming from a dear friend i thought i 'd actually try it .
now we 've had that huge bottle wasting pantry space for years .
if i had enough hair i 'd try your method .
i have alopecia so it 's mostly giant bald area with a few tufts here and there .
i look back at movies and pictures from the 30s and 40s when women did n't wash their hair but once a week and i 'm impressed with how very different it looks from modern hair .
my mom has horrific eczema well tentatively diagnosed as such they 're still not certain all over her body so bad she had to go on 3-month disability leave two different times and her scalp is where it 's the worst .
she 's tried every single thing she 's read or heard no matter how kooky but i 'm not sure if she 's tried just not doing anything !
she itches so much she 's destroyed her skin 's topmost barrier and she is frequently tearing her skin by accident just from scratching it 's so thin and papery now like a very old person 's .
without that natural barrier she 's more vulnerable to all the common allergens that never bothered her before compounding the problem .
she 's even allergic to her dachshunds who were sent to live with me and mine until a bloody 3-dog-fight meant we had to send them back .
they 've been kicked out of bed and sleep in little beds on the floor next to my dad and they do n't understand why their mama does n't touch them anymore .
and now she 's lost a big source of comfort and distraction .
it 's so heartbreaking to see her suffer and her self esteem too she hides under a hat and behind glasses .
she used to look years younger than her age and my friends would tell me oh your mom is so beautiful and you have the most beautiful mom of anyone i know which my mom of course loved .
this skin thing that has attacked her head to toe has aged her and made her brows and lashes fall out .
it 's just awful on top of how uncomfortable she is .
she 's been on a new drug an immunosuppressant much like what i take for ra but it did n't magically clear her up like my latest ra med did purely as bonus for my psoriasis .
and she 's stuck paying 10,000/month out of pocket for it because her boss is evil and my mom could and should sue her but that 's another tangent .
i 'm going to see if she 's willing to try not washing her hair at all .
when she was at her worst she spent every moment she could in the bathtub in a sea salt bath .
she would be all set up with drinks and snacks and her ipad in a waterproof case bingeatching 48 hours and forensic files .
she 'd call on her way home from work sobbing in discomfort and my dad and i would get her bath ready so she could get in immediately .
one time she did n't even turn off the car she threw it in park and ran into the house while tearing her clothes off she was itching so badly .
i vowed not to do this in the new year !
but i sensed you might be a sympathetic ear and might have some advice .
and it 's cathartic for me to talk about it which i rarely do .
i think the clarity could have been improved before but it 's gotten much worse now .
this is one of those incredible reddit threads that i try to tell somebody about later and after explaining the whole context and all the this guy said and then some other guy said '' they just look at me and go heh yeah '' because you ca n't really explain reddit threads
as long as there 's no limit on in-service distributions and there 's no fee to do so .
well done dude listen i know im just a random voice off the internet but i can tell you that you have definitely made the right decision .

when he says everyone 's name is amir blumenfeld what 's your name ? ''
and then bad example '' with the belly slap when they respond is one of my favorite jake and amir moments .
i got ta get rid of this thing so we can both move past it .
we tend to forget that he filmed it in 1992 93 ?
with the idea that you would have been glued to your movie theater seat for 3 hours already riding the roller coaster of violence and atrocities shown without the ability to pause go to the kitchen for a drink take bathroom break etc .
he wanted to people to have a chance to let out their emotions a bit before cutting to the end scene with the now old real-life survivors walking and visiting the gravesite and make that part a bit more uplifting .
and besides ... what a cinematic gut-punch ... i ...
i could have got more i do n't know .
if i just ... i could have got more .
i saw it in the theater 2 weeks after it premiered in 93 and i was holding on to being stoic until that line and then ... urk .. sob

i 'm currently trying to use the visual studio 2017 integrated cmake 3.9 and i want to stab myself .
visual studio is ignoring some compile flags that i toggled with target_compile_options so i could n't get it to build with c++17 enabled .
the documentation for cmake is also poor with many deprecated functions not being labelled so until i stumble upon another newer function that says that it should replace the former .
i 'm gon na run on stage ... actually just an awkward trot will do .

if they would consider my idea i figure robots would need an overhaul and multiple robot types with upgraded capacity would also be in order .
it would also create an interesting design choice would want fewer bots bringing in bulky loads or smaller bots bringing in small quantities to multiple places faster .
or just go ham with the bulky ones if you got the tech resources and planned out bot network .
it 's not a perfect idea by any means i just want to find a solution where they stay powerful and also become interesting to play with mechanically .
i think if you make the logistics to use them interesting intuitive and perhaps even hard .
that they will balance the other ways out and supplement them better .
take trains for example they are versatile and incredibly powerful .
yet no one is complaining about trains because setting up rails is a new experience deepening the gameplay and adding yet another layer to the puzzle .
they require special items more space and the knowledge of signals which is a new exciting element that only this mode of transportation uses .
if we added the same elements that made for example trains exciting which in my opinion is the planning that 's what this is all about .
i think bots feel so easy and cheaty because the lack of that planning and it outshining others greatly although i do n't see the outshining as the issue i think that was what they were mostly talking about in the fff .
the fact that their best lategame option somewhat cripples their own intricate puzzel they were building .
or well maybe not crippling but it certainly helps you solve the puzzle that much easier .
and it detracts from the intricate complexity they were building towards in lategame .
i do n't think current lategame is easy and boring but i do think it takes away from their design intentions .
and the last fff was a way to make it discussable .
and although the vast majority and probably also my idea are made by uninformed non game designers who know shit about gameplay or balance .
so in that vein i would very much like to hear all of your opinions on the matter .
its not about how to not damage other relationships .
thats a fruitless bowl of worry that you dont need .
its that youve made a choice and the relationships that are impacted by that choice have their own choice to make as a result .
do they respect your decision and stand by you or do they disapprove and throw a tantrum not come cut ties tell you they disapprove and come anyways cause they still love you ... who knows what will happen !
it very well could offer up some unsavory moments and frankly im expecting it to but you have to let go of whats out of your control .
just as you have every right to your opinion and decision so do those other relationships .
focus instead on the end goal of best day ever .
what can you do to brighten that day without depending on maybe relationships to do so ?
remind yourself of who is coming that supports you and your choices .
but above all.. this is about you and your partner .
you can spend all day trying to satisfy everyone in attendance but its going to wear you out thin .
i learned something very quickly while planning and while i had heard it before it never carried more weight than my wedding .
and trust me love you ask.. they gon na tell you ... and then they are gon na be upset when you dont do it the way they told you to .
just got done telling my cousin sept 2018 to stop asking people what they think .
do what you think and feel in your gut is right .
another unfortunate side of this sword youre playing with is that youre going to learn very quickly whos real and whos too opinionated to depend on .
you have a big new life ahead of you.. having those that are truly dependable stand out and be accounted for is honestly the most valuable thing we walked away with knowing after our wedding day .
ok maybe not literally every time but i can 100 say that drivers treat a cx-5 with less respect than a mustang .
if i 'm going 45 in a 40 in the mustang no one is passing or cutting me off .
my wife notices it as well and has said she wants a mustang too because no one fucks with it she was the one that pointed it out to me .
talking about metro phoenix where it is fairly crowded 2 lanes each way everywhere most people speed .
if it 's gon na backfire it 's better it backfires against all of you and not just the other 5 members of your team .
you have to be able to understand what is the best contribution you can make ... .
not grouping with your team in order to stay alive/stay back on the point has a ... pretty boring point value .
maybe you 'll win a 1v1 vs the enemy tracer/genji/sombra who comes to backcap the point and yay .
or you lose and they cap anyway and your team has to run away and is in a 5v6 .
or you stay with your team and either all die together not that bad keep winning pretty good or the enemy back caps ... and you all run back in a 6v6 .
i think if you run the numbers on that you 'll decide to group up .
i personally found the best way to deal with the fat molded was to eliminate the other two and then just circle around the fat one while punching it .
kinda like that bit in shaun of the dead .
i wonder if the direct was originally scheduled for the 11th but due to leaks koizumi and kimishima decided to push it back to throw everyone off the trail and get back at the leakers ... lol

i really hope this comes to iphones or at the very very least ipads .
apple already said that once they got faceid working that they did n't even pursue other fingerprint options in-screen on the back etc .
the platforming is made challenging because the jump mechanics are n't great .
running through it figuring it all out on my own was amazing .
the giant rolling statue was breathtaking when you do n't expect it .
the dark room was absolute hell and i enjoyed every second .
obviously this sort of thing is n't for everyone but i 've always loved this sort of thing .
so because it 's been painted with blue in various places we can now assume the kessel run will end up being some kind of space race .
or decent intelligence if you enlist and score high on the asvab your waaaay more likely to be able to pick your spot .
in the u.s. black people have historically been called monkeys '' pejoratively .
i presume because of darker color and the implication that they are uncivilized .
it is a very offensive thing to call a black person in the u.s. but i can understand if you do n't know the context it does n't sound that offensive .
i mean the eagles beat the raiders without even practicing at full speed once that week .
i do n't think you can use a scare ellipsis on our team like that .
it only vaccinates against the predicted flu strains for the season which scientists predicted incorrectly this year .

remember when tryn could spin through a xerath q and get a fuckload of money and xp
i 'm seeing mixed responses here but i can say that i was able to activate both simultaneously and it certainly feels like it 's working .
i was playing a game last night and each time this twinblast attempted and attack on me i would trigger them both and he would kill himself in about 3 shots his own shots plus like 2 hammer swings from sevarog .
now clearly twinblast is squishy but if he 's killing himself that quickly..
i would imagine that you 're correct assuming each shot cools down like any other basic attack .
i play yin a lot and while i agree that she 's one of the weakest carries overall right now i think that she really only is effective from like 25 30 minutes and on .
once she 's fully online she 's online and i do n't think there 's another carry with as much potential dps as her with the cleave .
and you 're just screaming omg racist ! without considering that maybe it was just a dumb oversight by a website designer to use that shirt with that kid .
it 's not that big of a deal in this situation .
sure if donald trump was calling black kids monkeys that 's different .
fortunately the sideline interference penalty only ended up probably costing about 5 yards of field position .
i remember going into the bookstore and checking iclicker prices and thinking wtf . ''
the only thing worse than iclickers is the reef polling app .
why the fuck does it cost more for a year of reef than a brand new iclicker 2 ?
i 'm surprised they did n't cut to commercial during that review .
development is painfully slow but there has been major updates including pve .
jason jordan looks like a jacked excited make-a-wish kid who is just happy to be there .

i want everyone to slowly excuse themselves until stu is the only one left in the studio .
not meant to sound snippy or judgmental why do you feel other people 's bodies are your business ?
when i see these comments i think i should n't have
that pride is just making everything harder than it needs to be .
you mean one of the other responses that i mentioned ?
also yeah this was also one of the first comments in the topic bud my comment has loooong since been answered by now no need to be snarky .
so many movies i wish i could watch again for the first time .
almost all the top posts in this sub are shilling their own coins .
prl ven req icx are shilled to death in this sub already .
i do n't mind seeing new coins gaining more exposure here it 's a new opportunity to a lot of people too .

aside from weiss ' hatred of the white fang and velvet being bullied by cardin and his posse we do n't see any evidence of this mistreatment in the larger world .
there 's an episode in v5 do n't remember which where when qrow leaves the craftsman 's shop after his second visit a no faunus '' sign can be seen on the wall outside .
it 's a very small way of showing it but it at least shows me that the writers have n't completely forgotten about the faunus racism thing .
it 'd be stupid to say that looks are n't a factor when it comes to dating .
alright then so we have similar opinions just differing on the degree .
haha i knew when i posted that there was a 75 chance it would quickly come back to haunt me .

a light gathers on the center of the floor .
it shimmers dares to be loud and threatens to bounce .
it could be a flame or a spike of ice she can not be sure and there is a dash of hope in her chest .
all she has to do is focus her energy on that very center .
it groans at the sudden pressure with books toppling over raining down on her head .
she claws to the other side and rolls on her back .
the precious light colorless and colorful in its own way sizzles into nothingness leaving a small mark on the floor where it had briefly lived .
over the past fifteen years the results have repeated themselves .
it 's a simple concept to work into theory to muse over under starry nights but horrifically difficult to put into practice as the blinding sun observes among the clouds .
there 's so much potential in what it can do in what it can be .
all she wanted was to bring forth light immeasurable powerful binding light .
but this is the result she reasons of relying on a single source .
she moves to where the mark stains the floor and stares tiredly at it .
she presses two fingers on top of the mark .
midnight blue covers her fingers and she smirks weakly .
emotion is hungry greedy and can not be sated .
it begs for more calls for more which explains its abundance in spell casting .
it 's the meat of magic the evidence is irrefutable .
and yet ... she gazes up to the ceiling to the revealing glass .
the indigo skies are darkened into a grey violet and the birds ahead flap weakly ready to collapse .
like veins cracks strip through the skies threatening to topple the heavens down onto the world beneath it .
it 's as if a spider 's intricate web has made itself home and although three thousand years have passed since the initial crack appeared .
time is wasted on emotion and soon the darkness shall spread kingdom wide swallowing the everyone and everything within its borders .
glaring she steps away from the mark and goes to her bookshelf where the books lie dejectedly .
taking them into her arms she does n't read the titles and exhaustion tingles in her arms .
she 'll leave them on the table for now .
she sees it ... in one of the books the heaviest one is a small scrap of paper .
the evolution of magic she 's read the book at least three times taking notes and using them during practice .
informative the results are as useless as her notes and she sets the books on the table taking the scrap of paper from the book .
how could i have missed this ? she wonders aloud as she flips the scrap .
it is n't even a torn strip from the book .
she whispers the words non-committedly letting them roll loosely off her tongue .
a glow so bright threatens to hurdle her back into the bookshelf and as quickly as it appeared it disappears .
her stomach plummets her vision blurs and she 's standing there with her back against the wall paper still clutched in her grasp .
she wants to shout maybe scream but all she can do is pant .
she stares down at the paper blinks back at the circular stain on the floor almost the size of the floor itself .
that does not mean it is impossible and a slow steady grin takes over .

i find a lot of people like to cite the 1lb per gallon rule but it really comes down to how porous the rock pieces are .

he does n't speak english or at least did n't and his social media has been written like someone for whom english is a native language .
i 'm not saying what you 've said does n't have merit but it 's quite obviously not him tweeting etc .
he 's never really played for us and its impossible to judge where he is .
he was really promising at marseille and i think he 'll do really well at burnley if he plays regularly .
ya i was saying stay at park city and then if needed drive over to bcc for solitude/brighton or lcc for sb/alta if conditions warrant .

though again and again i notice guys overestimating lookism .
it is how you present yourself is more important than your face or height .
so that includes your clothes posture smell assertiveness how you act in a crowd and so on .
you do not have to chase hotties you just have to make them notice you your best qualities as soon as possible .

it is quite literally impossible to have a 1v1 with no lag or desync included in battle arena at least though unless someone gets killed in 5 seonds .
so you preach positivity in all aspects while acknowledging as beings we enjoy hate on some level even you .
we enjoy our ‘tribe ' as it were we seek commonality in any form we can because in our daily lives that has been stripped of us and so through our hobbies work or relationships construct our tribes ?

i 'd guess that the sociology professors were similar to you .
i suspect they will talk as little as possible about 'launch ' .
it will happen in march but it will happen in the form of yet another release with the yellow text saying 'pre-release ' gone .
not all of the promises will be met and they will continue to improve the game post 'launch ' .
they are basically getting this elephant out the room as quietly as possible .
it 's not like they are launching servers selling games on shelves etc .
the game is already available to everyone all this is doing is purely changing the label .

i just said the survey monkey polls was done over five days and the fact that it matched the other scientific polls corroborates the results .
online self selecting polls do not provide good results .
otherwise explain how we can have online self selecting scores of 85 75 and 49 ?

using scientific polls to get an accurate understanding is just basic polling fundamentals .

i do n't mind celebrities running for office as long as it is a lower office .
the problem is that i see a lot of people complaining about how nm promised them an alternative method .
just like how you can be pissed about not finding dinner at home after work those people can be pissed about not being given an alternative but it 's an entirely different thing from being pissed about someone breaking a promise they did n't make .
in case you do end up adopting both make sure you read up on littermate syndrome !

for almost all of the adobe suite your preview will lean on gpu but the render itself will lean on cpu .
if you 're lacking experience using these programs it can be difficult to know what 's important for you to optimize .

it sounds like you need to explore what being aromantic actually means and work on cultivating other friendships so you 're not totally dependent on one person regardless of whether you wind up pursuing a love life or not .
and yes your boyfriend is probably going to need some time to get over his disappointment ... but the odds of you two getting through that and becoming friends again are better if you 're open and honest with him now than if you keep pushing him away and rejecting his romantic gestures until he has no feelings left other than hurt and frustration .

i have n't listened in a while but i definitely enjoyed a few of her songs .
so as a non-sec fan this was a rough game to watch .
first half was fine but in the second half the refs had some bad calls or no-calls that really helped bama out like a punt that georgia blocked that was wiped out by an offsides call was actually a false start a late hit to the head of the georgia qb that was not flagged a phantom pi call on third down that extended a bama 4th quarter drive that resulted in a touchdown and at least two blatant no-call holds on the bama o-line .
with all that being said georgia completely blew this one .
they abandoned the pass game and got overly conservative in the fourth quarter .
they probably could have scored again if they balanced the offense .
then they had the opportunity to win in ot and completely blew coverage .
alabama didnt win this game as much as georgia shot itself in the foot while taking a bat to the dome swung by the refs .
zoloft brought me out of a deep depression but once i was n't depressed i hated that it made me tired and unmotivated with no sex drive .
i was hesitant to try another antidepressant but my doctor pushed me to try trintellix and it was life changing .
it does cause a lot of nausea and for that reason i do n't take it as consistently as i should sometimes but when i do it makes me a happier person than i ever thought i could be .
three weeks after going on it i went to my check up and remember excitedly asking my psychiatrist if this is what happiness feels like .

i think the next time she does something call her out on it and let her know you understand she 's having a rough go at the moment but it 's not okay to treat other people that way .
they have to learn how to treat people too and if they 're seeing her act this way they are learning that it 's okay when it 's not .
it 's just a different type of skill now .
these young guys have adapted to the speed and now now making moves and being creative at high speed and in tight spaces with tight checking .
before there was more space and guys had more room to make moves and be creative .

most of these comments are from people who skipped gym class let alone tried out for sports .
there 's irish americans who dress up in green and drink guiness by the pint .
there 's scottish-descendant americans who are big into whiskey kilts and a sproggin on their belt to hold their whiskey and a big love of haggis .
maybe it 's because the welsh identity is really watered down these days .
perils of being the most subjugated and controlled part of britain .
the scottish were too hard to fight the irish had the whole 'sea ' thing stopping invasions being easymode but the welsh just had guerrilla tactics in snowdon and eventually we became 'basically english but with vague memories of a language we reconstructed somewhat towards the 20th century ' .
it 's weird too since the common depiction of a welshman in fiction is usually a short brown haired person which is not what the historical record would show at all .
ancient wales was full of tall buggers with fair hair supposedly .
to answer your question no it is not selfish for you to feel that way .
it 's completely understandable why you would feel that way .
the idea to invite her boyfriend was a horrible and inconsiderate move on her part and you have the right to be annoyed at this .
i would suggest that you talk it out with her so that she leaves him out of this .
if she refuses to do so go on the holiday with someone else/by yourself and to not be friends with her anymore .
this just shows that she 's not a very caring person and by talking it out you 're displaying maturity and confidence in what you want .

not sure about you but once i was old enough to use the bathroom myself my parents no longer saw me naked .
just because i do n't see a family member in a sexual way does n't mean i 'm comfortable seeing them naked .

if eth kept its growth rate and the market expanded to 5t it 's market share would be around 800b or so and stellar 's 100b would n't look so lofty .
pretty much all speculation who even knows if stellar or eth will be here in 2019 .

quot basically any way you say it marijuana is an entry drug into the higher drugs quot alford said as first reported by the garden city telegram .
quot what was the reason why they did that ?
one of the reasons why i hate to say it was that the african-americans they were basically users and they basically responded the worst to those drugs just because of their character makeup their genetics and that quot he continued .

not just that but the nature of the attack planes of civilians used as missiles against other civilians .
while the loss of life does n't remotely compare to hiroshima or the great wars those were wars and we can rationalise it in our heads .
in war we had the enemy soldiers in their uniform and our soldiers in uniform fighting eachother .
as civilians in the uk the air raid sirens went off and you went to your bunker to weather it out by you did n't expect your own people to drive your own planes or busses into your buildings or run into a music arena with a bomb or drive nail bomb trucks into busy city centres .
it 's such a head fuck and it 's winning in spreading fear .
progress is strange it 's like we 're going forwards and backwards at once .
bolasie had the same injury and is only recently back .
he had videos of him messing around playing about 4 months ago but was n't considered healed .
my point is zlatan 's lion comments implied he was superior in the healing process than others .
if this news is true it shows he was n't but that he just rushed himself back .
if that 's the case he deserves some stick for his comments .

i dated a guy who worked at disneyland and he was just demented .
at first he seemed like a cute creepy dark haired glasses wearing weirdo but a few things happened .
first he would get super upset any time he mentioned how badly he wanted to be an army sniper but that he was n't able to because his eyesight was poor .
and he mentioned it every time i saw him .
second i went to his family 's house and from the outside it looked great but inside it was the most disgusting filthiest smelliest house i 've ever seen .
it made me gag just to stand in it .
and his mom had some kind of mental handicap and was very short and very fat with really tiny stubby hands—i 'm usually very kind and sensitive to these things but i just felt like i was in an episode of american horror story .
he took me to disneyland and introduced me to all these employees and told me all their weirdo messed up stories and all the people who died at disney stuff like that .
i thought i was into dark and mysterious but he was too much .
yeah i just saw some highlights looks massive fck me .
does it actually have anything to do with the writing system ?
i assumed it was more that it was n't possible in the japanese language to end with consonants and the writing system and pronunciation of english words are both reflections of that .
i do n't think they ever even tried to explain why this occurred other than falling debris '' .

in book 5 jon read the pink letter the letter sansa read in 6x04 and decide on his own to take back winterfell and save arya who is secretly jeyne poole he help stannis and plan the area when he should go to reach winterfell
and later even send mance rayder to go to winterfell and save fake arya ...
on the show jon does n't want to fight despite the fact that he just heard that his brother he captured ... ..everyone ignored his ptsd and call him a pussy who depend on sansa 's support ... .while sansa is the brave one who want to take back winterfell
ramsay is jon 's nemesis in the books sansa have no ties with him ... .jon planned on killing him himself ... but nope .
arya who was trained by the best assasins in the world and trained to contain and simulate emotions use her surrounding to become a shadow ...
start blaming sansa for no reason and act like a edgy kid with no brain..while sana is the rational sister who understand how both are manipulated ...
about the battle sansa tried telling jon but he dismissed her '' no he did n't ... ... she have full authorision to say what she want .
and when he ask ... . '' what should i do. ?
i do n't know anything about battles '' ... ..
jon lead the battle jon capture ramsay annd send her to sansa on a plate..so fuck off ... jon royce helped jon not sansa ...
baelish already planned this and kn ew that sansa would contact her ... .that why he stationned his man at moat cailin you dumb cunt
season 5 and 6 sansa is just a reflection of what book jon alys theon and jeyne are in book 5 get the fuck out of here with your bullshit
if he 's there for 6 years i 'd say there 's a 90 chance
it does n't provide anything to the conversation and is misleading .
again no one is pretending this does n't happen at all .
people like this are pretending however that muslim women are suffering some kind of stockholm syndrome and are all constantly afraid for their lives .
this is because they are ignorant and their knowledge of islam comes from post 9/11 war on terror propaganda .
the point is that these cases are an extreme minority and ordinary muslims should not be expected to act as if they 're representatives for their entire religion .

do n't know why this was so downvoted you 're just answering the question .
i could have rewritten it yes but i 'm not sure i could convey the point better .
to get rid of the possibility of coming across as condescending i would also have had to tone back my shock and the force of trying to express how mistaken you seem to be about this .
i was n't trying to take back what was said just letting you know it was not meant with malice .
i would have contacted either your cc company bank or paypal regarding the issue after they stopped responding .

sell them for dent coins and then buy back data when you need it .

on friday we have a yearly office party where people from all the cities where we operate meet .
we have a hotel booked for 1 night and will spend almost 2 days all together .
the action takes place in norway most people are norwegians some swedes and some germans and it 's several hundred people ages very varying .
i am very socially awkward around people who i do n't hang out with or who i have n't met .
last year i did participate in this party too and even though i was very nervous my faking the confidence strategy was using the fact that i 'm new .
i was n't that nervous that other people would think i 'm awkward because they barely knew me or did n't knew at all and i 'm new so it 's normal to be nervous also i was n't nervous that someone would think i 'm lame because i hang out alone again because i 'm new and do n't know anyone .
i did n't make any office friends '' during this year and i do n't have confidence to just join some group who 's chatting .
since im not new anymore people wo n't have curiosity to start talking to me first .
for example how can i start talking to someone what phrases to use how to not be annoying etc ?
i want to have fun but now i 'm starting to regret that i go .
since it 's only 2 days left it 's emergency and i 'm grateful for any advice ...

so as it says i 'm getting married shortly to my ll partner but after looking through db and thinking about it more i 'm starting to have second thoughts .
my so 26f i 27m have been together for 4 years and the first 2 years were great !
we 'd have sex at least everyday or every second day now it 's more like once every two weeks .
i 've spoken to her multiple times explaining that i have a hl and i 'd like more sex she seems to always have an excuse .
it 's either she 's too tired or too stressed or she 's just not in the mood .
i 've also always been the one to initiate we spoke about this and for a while she did initiate more often but now it 's back to barely ever .
as she rarely feels like having sex i 'm finding it harder and harder to initiate what 's the point if i keep getting knocked back .
so my question to you reddit is i 'm about to have a talk with her saying i 'm seriously reconsidering this marriage if it 's going to be more of the same .
do you guys/gals have any advice on what to say or how i should approach this ?

the trick is to keep it at a thick consistency so it 's no longer a powder but not watery .
the amount of alcohol is in the milimeters so it wo n't really affect you .
i just scoop it using a spoon an wash a few spoontips down with soda water .
it has almost no taste as the chalky powder does n't hit your taste buds the paste ball just goes down .
it 's similar to the honeyball method but i found honey to be messy and alot of work to make .
also i 'm mostly keto so i try to avoid sugar .
btw i started in halloween and lost 10 lb 's without working out i 'm convinced the average diet has excessive sugars and carbs now after taking a break from them
when i 'm out i use plastic test tubes to carry the powder it in my pocket holds approx .
2 doses based on the mm size you get .
if i understand everything correctly mombi though a powerful witch is in disguise as a lowly sorceress in the gillikin northern country hiding from the good witch of the north .
nobody is supposed to know who she is or what she can do .
general jinjur is a munchkin from the east country and was a young peasant girl until her bid for power .
there seems to be no way that they should be acquainted yet when jinjur needed to stop tip and his gang she immediately goes to the witch .
i 've been given a datadog account with and plan on bootstrapping it using terraform but do you have any tips to really make it fly ?

please consider youtube or other platform next time you 're arbitrarily banned .
the bindings laid upon you are coarse rough and almost agonizing to experience .
you came here expecting rose-petals and soft silken ribbon i suspect not these painful shackles of hemp and cold iron .
you are bound on your knees ankles held close by shackles connected with short chains arms bound at the wrists and forearms up to the elbows by that rough hemp rope scratching and scraping at your tender peasant flesh .
you are kept low to the ground bent downwards and attached to the floor by an extremely short chain leash latched to the steel collar around your neck .
this forces your face low to the ground and your ass up into the air sticking out for the whims of my royal pleasure and your pain .
you can see nothing thanks in no small part to the thick blindfold covering your eyes .
your mouth is forced wide open by a ring gag of unforgiving steel that makes you embarrassingly drool all over the floor and the two tiny metal hooks in your nostrils attached to strings running over your head and attaching to the back of your collar that force your nose into a shape like a pig 's snout only add to that humiliation .
there is a tapping of high heels on stone the same stone that wears at your knees and makes this position even more unbearable and after a second you feel a weight pressing down on the thick steel plug i forced into your asshole an hour ago forcing it deeper and deeper with the weight of my tread .
i would love to show you off my little whore '' i say in that cold aristocratic tone mocking and superior .
but i ca n't be seen dallying with trash such as yourself ... ''

anything not on the limits list is open to discussion i am a benevolent queen .
i 've been insanely curious about this for months and after hearing about what it does i 'm even more excited .
i just wanted to say thanks in the small chance you see this .
there are not a lot of constants in my life but your show has been a constant and its small but it really helps to know that at around 4 mon-thursday i can watch you deliver the news .
it really helps in time when i 'm down and it just something to look forward to during my day .
i just wanted to say thanks for providing that and a community like this .
i saw on the wiki how you can transfer your vip to multiple accounts .
i have vip on my main and i 'm wanting to have it on another to start a storage tower .
can someone explain it a bit better to me ?

at least five people are dead amid mudslides in southern california where heavy rains triggered flooding and massive run-off us media report .
quot waist-deep quot mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires last month shut down more than 30 miles of the main coastal highway officials say .
wildfires in december including the thomas fire swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides .
burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods .
the federal emergency management agency shared a warning for california homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk .
the storm over california is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches in the foothills and 9in in select areas .

hi so i 've been trying to get this to work for a while but i ca n't seem to be able too .
i 'm using the offline version of motion joy but for some reason the offline version is n't detecting either device my laptop is detecting both devices and i 've got the drivers installed and the controller registered through scp .

my 3 dogs are not completely housebroken so on my hardwood floors in one room i buy really thick shower curtains double them and put thick piddle pads on top .

ndad is a volatile manipulative and completely unreedemable individual .
you can not speak to him as every single thing he says is subtle and manipulative with the intent of forcing dependence to him or belittling you .
i cut off contact with him after i realized he had gone too far .
unfortunately my brother is still in contact with him he unintentionally left his facebook conversation between him and ndad on my laptop maybe what i did was invading his privacy but please read on .
it was sickening my ndad was manipulating him just like he had done to me .
it was also filled with lies targetted at me he says he is worried '' about me and needs him to keep an eye on my behavior '' .
he makes my brother tell my mum how much he loves her '' which of course brings her flashbacks of being assaulted by him .
my brother happily does this under the delusion that me and my mother are sick and dysfunctional and that ndad is going to save us .
me and my brother never had the best relationship infact my brother bullied me for a while because he was jealous i was my ndads favorite .
but he is my brother and he does not deserve to be used and abused by some pathetic individual and my mother does n't deserve to be harrassed by him .
the only other option is to cut off from my brother as well as my ndad essentially tearing apart my family and allowing my brother to be harmed by this sick individual .
my mother is too afraid and too traumatized to do anything about the problem .

several months ago my cello bow was damaged and i filed a claim with the music instrument insurance company .
they had me take the bow to two different instrument specialists .
an insurance representative met me at the instrument repair shop and took possession of the damaged bow .
i signed papers transfefring ownership to the insurance company ...
he then cut me a check for the full appraised value of almost 17,000 .
well actually 16,900 because there was a 100 deductible i was amused that he had a business check printer in his car for such purposes ...
i deposited the check into my checking account and a month later used that money to purchase another bow .
which was around 19,000 needless to say i am insuring the bow with the same insurance company ... the premium is extremely reasonable at only 152 per year .
if so will i have to include that when i file my 2017 taxes ?
2 can i write off the purchase price 19,000 or part of it on my taxes ?

they say information is the greatest tool one can ever have .
the quality of information available determines how far you can go i have read some posts on here saying facebook whatsapp twitter instagram gmail and other applications/accounts ca n't be hacked .
i personally believed that too but the moment i have access to some basic information i knew anything can be hacked .
i met a computer guy named hackgeek not too long and he said something to me he said anything internet/computer can be hacked everything has a hole '' .
i got convinced when he hacked into my girlfriend 's gmail account facebook account and at the same time her whatsapp account .
i know its kinda bad do n't blame me .
you wo n't know he was in and out of your account and i 'm pretty sure that is why he called himself the hackgeek .
he is so different from other hackers and what makes him different is his geek characteristics .
hackgeek is taking back the term hacking which has been soured in the public mind .
hacking is an art form that uses something in a way in which it was not originally intended .
this highly creative activity can be highly technical simply clever or both .
hackers bask in the glory of building it instead of buying it repairing it rather than trashing it and raiding their junk bins for new projects every time they can steal a few moments away .
to people who doubt if accounts can be hacked you might want to try this guy out and see for yourself .
did i mention he does other jobs related to computer/internet too ?
why do n't you reach out to him and let him clear you doubt ?
is there any enhancement for ngxplay keyboard to fix some behaviors like showing over the apps and the size to small ?

so i was on youtube the other day and i saw an ad for an upcoming digital card battle game that wo n't rely too much on rng and wo n't favor pay-to-win players .
the ad said that the creators will only make the game if enough people back the game on a website and that if they do make the game all backers would receive a bonus in the game .
problem is i forgot what the game is called .
have any of you backed the game and if so what is it called ?
at least one of them made it to the boss waiting area but the other one was just randomly running up and down the dungeon so you must gather your party to continue was never accomplished .

back in the day wow had a system in which your character would become tired '' after a period of time and earn less xp until you logged out in an inn for them to rest .
people hated it because you were being penalized for playing .
so bliz got the brilliant idea to instead give players a rested bonus '' for logging out in an inn that would accrue over time and give bonus xp for however much of that rested bonus you accrued .
even though bliz may have reduced the amount of xp you gained overall by say ... 20 the fact you could get a 30 bonus for a time felt good so people liked it .
karma sounds to be a system based on penalties and easily exploited .
how do you stop a hatchling with nothing to loose from murdering you aside from murdering them in turn and so losing karma ?
how that is determined is up to the devs but you could have things like
healing an ally is 10 karma while wounding one is 20 so you ca n't hurt and heal someone repeatedly to exploit unless you make another account .
giving equipment to an ally gives you a of that item 's value in karma .
perhaps even if you 're dead it 's somehow tracked .
grouping with allies will have periodic karma bonuses as you stay in proximity and do things together .
does this stop a hatchling from attempting to murder you ?
no but the hatchling issue in itself should be fixed if/when the persistent injuries and recovery come into play .
what this does incentivize is working together with someone on the same team for an overall improvement to your karma whatever the bonuses may be rather than shooting someone in the face for immediate reward .
after all they may just give you a gun especially if people have rewards for giving helping and working together .
im 22 male who has only had 1 sexual partner who i live with last night i noticed this tiny black dot out of nowhere on the mid part of my penis .

i 've been running rescue op missions at artemis lodge in celaeno these last few days and i feel very strongly about this
elite is a beautiful game one of the best looking in terms of stylish visuals but not enough content is set close enough to each other to really appreciate it .
many places lack points of reference nevermind the places that do n't have anything great to look at at the same time as performing missions and tasks near them .
running the rescue ops in celaeno literally darting back and forth a few km above below ?
the rings of the nearby planet with all the sights and sounds of the rescue ship and the damaged station has been one of the best cohesively presented experiences i 've ever had in this game .
i have over 500 hours at the moment and will admit i 've been a bit jaded lately with 2.4 's slow crawl of a pace but these last few days will stick with me as one of the best moments .
fdev please hand-craft more content close to sights like this .
whether it be a station arbitrarily close to a planet surface or a hazres dangerously close to a neutron star this is the stuff that is very much blowing my mind after so much playtime .
i recently heard that there was a combat spot that had appeared close to mitterand hollow .
this is another great example of how elite can really boost it 's 'presence ' of scenery without needing new assets .
i know this is n't new and people 's feelings on this have most likely been discussed time and time again but still .
i might even bother repairing artemis lodge if it means getting to hang around that area a lot more haha !
hey there fellow vancouver dwellers got a question that hopefully one of you may have an answer to .
as i 'm pretty sure a good number of you guys like myself order things from across the pond and over the land border fairly often ...
i 'm curious if anyone 's managed to self clear a package that 's held by canada post to avoid their handling '' fee totally a brokerage fee ... .
have done it with ups dhl etc ... as i do n't often feel like paying 40 for a 30 item ...
i 've never been able to get a straight answer out of any canada post staff as they usually seem to get annoyed or angry when the topic comes up even with my polite phone etiquette and overflowing charm ... ok maybe not overflowing charm apparently they ca n't give you a break down of the assessed duties gst pst handling fee over the phone either but being canada post i 'm not too surprised ...
tl dr basically canada post charges a handling '' fee which technically is their charge for prepaying cbsa for your gst/pst/duties which technically makes it a customs brokerage fee which technically means you can self clear your packages ... has anyone managed to do so ?
just a side note i usually ship to blaine as well but occasionally i have packages sent up here for convenience 's sake as i do n't really feel like making a day trip down to the us every month or so .
currently in a bbw league but i 'm sick of the engine .
we have 24 owners and run it off of the prior season 's data .
on the first day of suicune raids i had the following experience
spotty network connectivity forced me to get on the wifi hotspot of a friend 's phone .
i was still in the middle of trying to catch suicune when that friend moved on to the next raid with the rest of the group .
when the hotspot moved far enough away my phone briefly lost internet connectivity forcing me out of the suicune encounter before i could use all of my premier balls .
because of my past experience with errors and app crashes i believed that i could join the group at the next raid and then come back later to resume the suicune encounter as long as the raid was n't expired .
the group and i won the next raid and after catching that suicune i returned to the previous raid which had plenty of time still left on it .
but when i tapped on the gym the game showed me the green battle '' button which put me in a new lobby when i pressed it instead of resuming the suicune encounter as i had expected based on a lot of past experience .
the above experience led me to think that a raid gets reset after a certain amount of time if you do n't catch the raid boss meaning that you have to do the raid battle over again if you want another chance to catch the raid boss .
if this is the case then you could potentially keep doing the same raid two or three times in order to get additional rewards and/or reroll the raid boss 's ivs .
i easily beat the gengar and then restarted the app once the encounter/catch screen appeared .
i waited until 11:50 just past the ten-minute mark since starting the previous lobby before tapping on the gym again .
at this time the gengar encounter resumed so i restarted the app again .
i waited until 11:55 before tapping on the gym again .
at this time i saw the green battle '' button again so i was able to start a new lobby .
when the second battle was starting i was kicked out of the raid at go ! ''
with the message that i had already completed the raid .
i tried again a few more times at this gengar raid but the results were the same .
for some reason whether it was a deliberate choice by niantic or a bug the game partially resets the raid for you 15 minutes after you start a lobby .
i suspect that the reset occurs on the client side but not on the server side .
furthermore i suspect that there are two different raid completion '' markers one that is client-side and one that is server-side .
the game client marks the raid as complete when the encounter the bonus challenge '' is fully over i.e. when you 've caught the raid boss or when you 've run out of premier balls .
the game server marks the raid as complete either at the moment that you see the fireworks/confetti or at the moment of the you win ! ''
thus the game client allows/forces you to start a new lobby if your encounter is disrupted 15 minutes after you started the previous lobby .
however you will not be allowed to battle again because the server will have already marked the raid as complete for you .
in this situation you will not have any further chance of catching this raid boss .
please note that i did not try to tap on the gym at 11:51 or 11:52 so the reset may actually be ten minutes after the lobby counts down to zero rather than 15 minutes after the lobby starts .
i actually did this experiment several weeks ago but did not share it at the time because the information seemed to be rather esoteric and of very limited use .
however today i saw the following post about a bad ex raid experience and felt compelled to finally write about my findings https www.reddit.com/r/thesilphroad/comments/7pbrqp/detailed_mewtwo_ex_raid_battle_report
i will post the screen recording of the experiment later tonight when i have more free time .
tl dr you can not do the same raid battle again if you 've already won once meaning that you actually see the you won ! ''
screen even though the game will put you in a new lobby 15 minutes after you started the previous lobby which can happen if you close out of the raid boss catch screen before successfully catching it or using all of your premier balls .
therefore you will lose your chance to catch this raid boss .
keep this in mind for your next ex raid ! ! !

i work for a crisis hotline for children and there are quite a number of youth who i 've spoken with who have had their money stolen from them by their parents who have access to the money they earn due to them being the cosigner .

edit thanks for all the responses so far i appreciate them .
i 've been lurking for a long time now but have finally decided to post as i 'm at a loss at this point .
since getting a copper iud a little under two years ago i 've been dealing with consistent acne and breakouts .
i do n't even know how to categorize my skin type anymore .
it gets very oily and shiny thoughout my work day especially when i wear makeup .
when i leave the shower it feels a little tight but not too tight .
i 've been reading about the skin barrier/dehydrated skin and introduced more moisturizing lotions recently but no improvement .
also i do n't realy know if i do have dehydrated skin or if my skin is just actually oily ?
the ordinary 10 aha every other day started this 1 week ago
while i 've had consistent spots for about two years from april to august things seemed a little more tame and then recently the amount of spots has increased from 1-2 to 3-4 .
i also have previously tried doxy mino and spiro .
i only tried these antibiotics for 1 or 2 months max so wondering if i should try again .
the waitlists for dermatologists in the uk are very long so i would love to find a way to tame my skin while i wait if i do go the derm route .
there are a lot of theories about how raven got her powers and i 'm seeing ideas like raven killing the spring maiden after she left mistral being bounced around .

i got my fist dab pen last week and it worked the day after i got it but nothing after that my battery is just black with a button and has no name on it .
i 'm pretty sure it is the battery that is faulty but i 'm not positive .
when you press the button without the cartridge in the button lights up but if i put the cartridge in then it blinks white three times .
i am sure that it is charged and i have already tried raising the plate in the battery up a bit .
i also raised the plate up to see if there was a wire that broke or something but everything looked okay in there there was one wire attached to the plate .
i would really appreciate it i feel someone could help me .
now i just plugged it in and the light turned red then a few minutes later the light turned off and i tried hitting it and it lit up like normal for like half a second then went back to blinking white as for before it was just automatically blinking white .

i know research experience is the most important thing on a grad school application but how do other factors such as teaching experience clubs and industry internships rank in importance ?
what would you consider a good gpa and how would one make up for a mediocre one ?
there is no need to read the context sections if you know how you 'd answer just from reading the question .
any response to any subquestion is very much appreciated !
please do n't feel obligated to read/answer everything and i 'm sorry for the wall of text
subquestion 1 if i have a research position but it 's not in the field i ultimately want to enter how does that impact my chances of getting a position in that field ?
how would you recommend finding a position under a professor and how can i prove my competence prior to asking said prof ?
context currently i 'm doing research under a grad student developing software for terraforming research while i 'd be more interested in computer hardware-related research fpga/asic design and programming especially gpus or hardware-software interface isas oss compilers maybe security ? .
i 've been working with him since the june 2017 .
part of the problem is i have n't yet tried enough things to be certain of what i want to do .
i 'm trying to make the best of my current position by learning as much as possible about higher-level software development but i ca n't shake the feeling that this will make it harder for me to get a position under a professor in one of the fields i listed above .
though i am paid the time commitment is considerable and the grad student is not very organized and has no sense of work-life balance .
also he is not a computer scientist so he does n't really understand the time it takes to research and develop something of the scale that we 're working on .
i am trying my best to show him exactly what i 'm doing and thereby stand up for my time .
my current plan is to finish this project and then find another position .
specifically how would you rank research gpa teaching experience industry experience and clubs in admissions importance ?
context i also ta a lower-division ee course i was a lab assistant last semester and have since been promoted .
i really enjoy it and i get paid a decent hourly wage .
preparing sections does take time but i find myself using it to procrastinate on less interesting work .
i joined it to get experience with circuit design and building real things .
this is my least-favorite use of my time not because of the work but because of the people everyone 's very accomplished sure but they 're also extremely egotistical they look down on people who ask questions and are constantly looking to prove how much better/smarter they are than each other .
my gpa is improving but is still a modest 3.3 .
should i drop the club to dedicate more time to studying ?
it meets twice a week for a total of 6h/week but i also spend considerable time outside working on my project .
last played age 26 possiblly in his prime and was doing okay as regular .

i made some korma and the sauce is too thin .
good flavour but i think the yogurt split which has ruined the texture .
the recipe said to add yogurt before simmering to finish cooking which i have since learned is a good way to ensure it splits .
right now it is too runny and not very creamy .
i thought about adding dairy either more yogurt or cream instead but there 's already so much liquid .
i also thought about pouring some of the liquid out but then i 'd be losing flavour .
tried the the search but did n't find anything similar .

this happened about 9 years ago so my memory is fuzzy on the small details but i just found this subreddit .
i worked at a national chain that was open 24 hours .
my restaurant was not that busy so it was just me and a cook working most nights on the grave shift .
on this night 4 teens walked in and sat in the booth closest to the door .
normally i 'd be wary of this and keep a close eye on them but one of them would come in fairly regularly and i never had any problems with him so i was n't too worried .
meals are eaten check is dropped and i 'm over cleaning the milkshake machine or something when they all get up and run .
i run after them but there was nothing i could do .
i had worked there 4 months and never had a walk out i took pride in that seeing as how it was graveyard and we had plenty of sketchy people come in and out .
i was furious both at them and myself for letting my guard down but when i got to the table i felt like a kid on christmas morning .
i set it up on the counter as me and the cook wondered how long it would take for them to figure it out .
about 20 minutes later it rings and i answered hi you have reached restaurant .
they called multiple times that night each time with a different way to try and get it back .
they accused me of stealing it to which i said i would gladly give it back if they wanted to come back and pay the bill .
they accused someone else of stealing it and the thief must have left it there .
they said it was their sisters phone and they want to come pick it up .
they said if i do n't return it they would call the police .
i do n't remember all the calls but they tried about every 30 minutes and i always smiled when it rang .
i was off work at 6:00 am so around 5:45 we dialed the mom number this was before smartphones and there was no lock on it .
we had determined by where it was found and the phone calls that it belonged to one of the girls who had very distinctive hair .
sorry to bother you so early but does your daughter have black hair with a purple patch in it .
because she came into my restaurant last night with 3 friends and ran out on the bill but left her phone and i was wondering if you wanted to come and pick it up ''
in the background i heard the daughter say who is it mom ?
i do n't remember what the mom said but i could just feel her anger .
at 6:00 we told the manager of our fun night and that someone would be in to pick up the phone .
when i got back that night i was told that the mom had come in brought the daughter in to apologize to me but i was n't there paid the bill and left a tip .
the kicker was the mom was a waitress herself .
i could only imagine how angry she must have been or what punishment the daughter received .
i never saw those kids in the restaurant again .

you guys have turned into a actual circle jerk .
take a step back and see the toxicity you spew upon your own community .
this place is turning into a live version of the game where nobody is right and memes are funny .

while d2 has some major issues i still love the gunplay and the raids are still a blast .
i just logged on for reset today psyched to do some raiding went to all the lfg sites and it is a ghost town .
at this point it may be more challenging to get a group than to do the actual raid itself .
i remember logging on to the lfg sites during the d1 days and there were tons of people looking to group up ... to the point where it was almost a race to send a message hoping you would be the first to respond and get an invite .
now i will post a group and be lucky to get one or two hits over 5-10 minutes .
i 'm 26m and moved a couple states away because i was offered a new job and loved the opportunity about 3 months ago .
i made friends with these two guys who are a little older than me at my company .
we hang out maybe once a week at most and only really call or text each other if we are making plans .
i 'm the type of person who prefers to spend time with myself so hanging out with a group of people very often kind of drains me .
a little over a month ago my coworkers and i were out and introduced me to some of their friends .
one of them is this really nice girl who 's just a little older than i am .
we exchanged contact information and immediately she started messaging and calling me quite a bit .
she calls me at least once a day and texts me fairly often over the course of the day .
she also invites me to hang out at least 3 times a week .
things like lunch dinner go to a movie hang out with her friends .
it was fairly sure she had a crush on me because of the way she talked to me so i told her that i was n't really interested in a relationship right now .
she understood and did n't do any nice guy '' things .
she still continues to message me and call me .
it 's honestly kind of smothering me because i just want to be left alone sometimes .
i like having someone who 's is interested in talking to me but it 's really too much for me .
i just do n't know what to say because it 's not like i do n't want to be her friend i just do n't like to be messaged and called constantly .
i know i probably sound like an asshole but i just like being left alone .

i am doing a little internal data gathering for a clinic i work at but admittedly i am shamefully bad at biostatistics .
i get confused as to where to apply which test when .
basically i wanted to check to see if there was a statistically significant difference between certain results in a department of health surveillance report vs in our clinic .
so for instance if the report shows that 1000 people 50 of studied population 2000 is male and my clinic shows 150 75 of population 200 is male what do i use to tell if the differences between observed in the report and observed in my clinic are statistically significant .
i have a reference study that tried to do the same thing but they used chi-squared analysis .
no clue how they applied it to compare the two data sources though ...

i have some questions about the wireless charging that i want to address before i pick out a case/popsocket .
my first is if the wireless charging pad is worth it or not ?
am i soon to be college student going to use it enough to justify the extra cash ?
i just am unsure how useful it will be to me and also how long will one of them last is it just like a cord that deteriorates and shows inconsistency over time ?
my second question is how thick of a case can you get away with while still being able to utilize the wireless charging and is it at all possible to use a popsocket and a wireless charger ?

its the most sincere expression of admiration for a woman i can think of .
i mean it if you do n't want to be hypnotized you really should stop reading .
well i do n't know what to say to you .
now since you 're still reading i assume that means that you do like to be hypnotized for one reason or another .
maybe it 's the calm feelings that come over you when you let someone else take control .
there 's a place in your mind you like to go maybe a placid lake or a meadow on with a few clouds in the sky and a slight breeze or maybe the calm place you like to go to is simply your bed .
it 's something safe and calm that you like to go to somewhere that you can relax and all your cares will drift from you .
while you are relaxed i want you to think on a few things .
i want to give you some words these are very important words that you 'll need to remember .
when i say them certain things will happen for you and it will be the most natural thing in the world to you .
spellbound you will fall back into an obedient sleep and respond to the message with i am yours to command . ''
sunrise you will awaken from trance with no memory of being hypnotized .
pliant – you must answer any question honestly and completely after you read the trigger .
you will not find your honesty to be out of the ordinary .
dearest you must respond to any message that begins with this trigger .
lacuna you will close the window that you 're currently reading and have no memory of its existence .
while you 're awake you will not understand that you have been hypnotized .
it feels so good to just relax and let your mind drift .
it is so soothing to float away in your mind and just let yourself relax more deeply with each passing word .
your eyes see and your fingers type a response but you know that you 're not in control .
and so you let it happen even though it is n't your choice in the first place .
every time you obey you feel a rush of pleasure .
once you reply you will awaken without any memory of reading this post .
if you see this post you will close it and forget .
when you replay you will say that you are mine in the title .

i love seeing mercules ' posts about time to kill so i thought i 'd go a slight step further and show all possible combinations of headshots and bodyshots that can kill ranging from 186 damage to 201 damage .
this is all according to the damage numbers so the ttk may be slightly different in-game as we only see whole numbers and no decimals .
the tab themselves show the combination of shots in a column the sum damage and the time it takes to shot those bullets .
at the bottom shows the rpm and the numbers for headshots and bodyshots .
i also put every '' because i did n't put up numbers for weapons that have a spin up rpm increase or damage increasing perks such as kill-clip or d2 's equivalent of half-glass full i 'm quite sure that the numbers are accurate .
however thinking back i think i calculated the 720 autos incorrectly .
that 'll be my first edit to the document .
hope you guys find some sort of use for this .
i mainly made it so i could compare more than just optimal ttks .
i think that a lot of weapons have a solid practical time to kill .
720 autos should have the correct ttk and adaptive hand cannons were adjusted .
being off by 1 actually made a big difference .
the whole spreadsheet should be more readable and i also included a crit '' column to easier show how many bullets need to be headshots for that row .
i also highlighted the row in which can kill a 201 armor enemy the fastest .
ascending all my gear up to max ll to look how i wanted having trials to incentivise actually playing pvp all d1 pve content relevant mot and the about of love/hate for skolas made it a great time and there was plenty on this sub setting the stage for ttk to be well received .
pvp needed an actual balance patch and bugfixes for tlw but that was still my favourite period of destiny by far .

i meant like it was the first boss we got a glimpse at and he 's arguably the most memorable beast boss aside from rom if that makes any sense whatsoever i 'm shit at explaining myself that 's why whenever i think of bloodborne i think of the cleric beast since he was so heavily advertised in some commercials and other promotional stuff .
that being said i expected the cleric to be a relative pushover .
after all he was the first fight of the game for most people .
then again he was followed by one of the hardest bosses not only in early game but in all of bb for a lot of people so it 's an interesting way they went about it .

i definitely sympathize with you but i encourage you to take a few moments to really consider what type of snake is right for you .
different species have different care needs and you should be educated on their needs and have all of the required equipment/materials before bringing the pet home .
this means you should decide on a species beforehand and not just pick up whatever the guy has .
or you might find yourself repeating the situation you are currently in
edit and i would not recommend getting another snake from this guy because he has demonstrated that he gives bad advice and does n't care about what happens to his animals .
for example sand is not safe to use with snakes .
it can irritate their eyes nostrils and cloaca aka butt and cause infections because it is very difficult to keep sanitary think cat litter box ew ! .
plus they will swallow the sand if it sticks to their tongue they ca n't digest or pass the sand so it builds up in their guts and causes impactions that are fatal if you ca n't see a vet for surgery .
other things to consider do you have a way to check the temps and humidity ?
if these are not in the correct ranges the snake wo n't eat and can get sick .
i see you have a thermostat which is great !
a lot of beginners do n't realize they need one .
i know you are eager to have a snake friend and i know you want to do the right thing !
just slow down and research there 's no rush !
it caused me a lot of heartache and stress in the beginning because i also jumped into things without really knowing what i was getting into and my first snake ended up dying because i was n't caring for it properly .
trust me when i say the right snake is worth waiting for
i 'm going to go against the grain here and tell you that you need new friends .

are these your animals or your father 's animals ?
are they on an open range or a fenced pasture ?
what evidence do you have that the dog killed these animals ?
the dog was in the property eating them it was large enough to kill them dog foot prints were spotted around the pasture .
there is no evidence of pigs being on the property no footprints and none have been seen literally eating the sheep .
this dog could very likely be euthanized if it is running at large and killing livestock .
i know i was saying that i do n't see another option apparently we can ' keep the dog out so i do n't know what else to do .
do you have actual photographic evidence showing the dog killing or eating any animals ?
do you have photographic evidence of the dog with blood on its muzzle ?
this is the problem if i did would n't be asking for help .
a dog can identify a dead body practically before it 's dead .
just in case are you talking about the dance-fight against miracle ?

in my jerk 's case the effect was almost magical .
above you said that you can change between male and female .
they were more closely related to the razors but newer units say made in philippines '' instead of made in japan ''
i think when they quit making the old 20-60 razors that were like these with better glass they changed the intrepid from razor to viper glass .
all the intrepids were japanese glass but looks like they 've changed it on the spotters and they discontinued the intrepid riflescope .
the riflescope was the best deal on any optic in the 20x range .

in the picture i do n't have the exact angle as the picture pose .
and yes ... .unfortunately i can not do anything more than what i 've got so far .
the lower lips for example if i narrow the lower lip a bit more it changes the shape in the middle ... .so it looks totally off .
cheeks also ... can not make them less pointy ... do n't have sufficient morphs same goes for everything else you mentioned besides the face being flatter ... .here 's a side profile picture of her http l7.alamy.com/zooms/c1a6781039e04f1f94617d58dbdf6c20/new-york-usa-18th-jan-2017-anya-taylor-joy-attends-split-new-york-hhfnt0.jpg

yeah i personally do n't like ineed and other such mods like frostfall and stuff .
one example is when i watched a youtuber play legendary permadeath with ineed and he was in a fight with astrid and died not to astrid but to eating raw meat because he did n't have anything else to keep him alive during the battle .
why would it be azura we already have 2 versions of her .
i asked the doctor about the accuracy of it because i 'd read and been told that the only surefire way to know was a biopsy .
they did say i may be intolerant but that i 'd have much more extreme symptoms if it were celiac and that it would be visible in my bloods .
also you could get an inflammation stool sample done .
i had it and there was no inflammation present .
just send it to your wallet from coin base .

bakugo is a piece of shit but i really felt bad for him when i read this the first time .
tree is definitely thinner than the camera makes it look !
when lower perspective is taken into account the trunk is no wider than 3 inches .
tree is definitely alive as it 's flexing when it 's hit but it 's also an aspen and underneath the bark it 's softer and slimy .
still hard but not likely to be rough when it breaks when it 's alive .
the fibers are very flexible when made thin so actually the more you hit it the more the texture will akin to a hemp or whatever the stiff but not rough plant based brushes are called brush .
this is the deck i put together for my sixth grade students when i was a teacher .

i have some small stuff along with tora to offer .
i totally get the sentiment and i cringe every time i hear her name in a headline but this time was somehow different because as much of a trainwreck as she has been in the past she did n't actually do anything in this instance .
basically she just showed up for a gathering that she was invited to and took a picture .
it was really the twitter-sphere that kinda blew up and felt that she did n't belong there and that 's why the inclusion of the story annoyed me .
if she actually did something fucked up again sure i do n't mind hearing about it .
but just being at an event is inconsequential and unworthy of discussion .

because they do not run on retroarch if they run in canoe .
if you for any reason would like to start specific games in retroarch and not canoe i 'd suggest you start reading the pinned frequently asked questions '' guide and read the textboxes you click yes modify the command line so the game thats noted to be incompatible runs in retroarch '' on the next time one pops up .
or just read the faq and compare the act raiser 2 command line in hakchi with the ones of other games .

it 's a play on that awful movie the room.
there was a documentary about it recently and people who saw the documentary thought that it was fake and the movie did n't exist .
also even if they do n't vanish they have shown how incompetent they are so whenever the price rices rapidly again there will be a new influx of users and then their servers will fall over and then it will be impossible to transfer away again and then the price of xrb will be low on mercatox while it 's high everywhere else .
u/deanblfc do n't think of the 1 xrb you pay to transfer out think of the remaining 15 xrb that you will have stuck on mercatox at some point in the future if you do n't .
i bought my xrb quite a while ago on mercatox and not being able to move them off there has been very frustrating .
i am transferring my xrb away from them and i will never use mercatox again .

people do n't remember it but when the queens were announced sasha was actually the number one fan choice to win .

well without the aquarium the octopus has 1-2 days tops of life .
imagine if you had a puppy with 24 hrs to adopt out or else it 'll suffocate and drown in its own piss .
except there are only a handful of people in the world who can actually accept the puppy .
she was freaking out over the safety and of the octopus it 's not easy to keep a level head when a member of your favorite animal is about to die in your hands .
of course the ideal reaction is to remain calm but op is a normal person and this is a difficult situation .
if you got fired because of them that 's an area you need to improve especially if you 're going to solicit new business which would most likely be over the phone .
you should be prepared for tech support '' if you 're going to start your own shop especially if you 're focused on smb .
they 're not going to want to hire one company to do network and another to do general support they 're going to hire one that does it all so become a generalist especially if you 're not in a position to hire someone else to do the things you do n't want to do .
it is true that the nine-banded armadillo dasypus novemcinctus always give birth to four identical offspring .

i see all these comments from dads about messing with their kids .
and it makes me wonder has my father been messing with me as well ?
why was n't he brought back to reprise his role as the hulk then ?
and they played to a super small crowd that year and actually cut their set a little short if i recall .
it was n't quite as shameful as the cure but you could tell they were n't having a great time .

they used to have 2 rapid scan conveyor belt check outs at my local albertsons in addition to the 4 self checkouts and 4 cashiers .
i 've tried to used it a few times but never felt it was that much faster .
maybe because i 've gone grocery shopping enough to know what numbers to look for etc .
but after a couple years they ripped out all the self checkouts in favor of the human '' element of customer service .
would 've been nice if they hired enough cashiers though ... .
yeah.. or maybe they are trying to limit the scalpers trying to resell or something .
thank god this has finally been addressed i 've been waiting for days ... ..

tim powers is an amazing writer with that keeps you engaged in his stories .
if half of every job that exists right now becomes automated and through market forces not enforced by some government policy then this does not mean that the number of jobs for people to do will be cut in half .
there are an uncountable number of jobs that do not exist right now because they 're too expensive or they are n't even imagined yet .
an effect of innovation is to make expensive jobs cheaper and therefore economically viable as well as create new jobs that have never existed before .
and dumpster about 3vs3 is not a word that should be used here .

if you 're just playing civ 6 runescape and similar stuff like that a gtx 1050 will be enough .

and in response i did not intend to suggest that the comparison between james and dumbledore was 1:1 exactly but that a lot of the same beats were hit .
i agree absolutely that james having no voice or input changes this equation .
i originally meant to emphasize more how the struggle over james was more preliminary and was more like preparation for the big complex struggle over dumbledore but my post got uh longer than i meant it to .
but you 're right i did completely neglect to include the divergence of the prince 's tale in my analysis .
i 'll counter though and say i still think the grindelwald thing is the major loss in faith for harry in dh .
he spends several chapters agonizing over it and the peace he makes over it is in part what allows him to trust dumbledore that one last time and make that walk to the forest .
been a bigger plan harry had simply been too foolish to see it he
that first sentence is actually a really interesting contradiction .
if it 's a betrayal how can it be nothing ?
it 's such a huge thing but he comes to terms with it almost immediately .
i do n't know that he could have made this leap as quickly as he did had he not already had to make his peace with who dumbledore was as he says to aberforth in the quote i pulled in the op .
anyway disagreeing with someone makes me uncomfortable so i 'm going to finish this by saying your comments are always awesome !

i always had problems with matthew 7:6 it seemed harsh and a bit cryptic .
yesterday i read proverbs 9 and verses 7-8 caught my eye .
it seemed strange to me do n't scoffers need the most reproof and the wise the least ?
i went back to matthew and noticed that 7:6 is right after a whole section on reproof .
7 he who reproves a scoffer gets shame for himself and he who rebukes a wrong one gets himself a blemish .
8 do not reprove a scoffer lest he hate you reprove a wise one and he loves you .
6 do not give what is set-apart to the dogs nor throw your pearls before the pigs lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you in pieces . ''

i may be negotiable depending on your offer and i do take items depending on what it is .
first of all bear in mind this is a rambling speech/explanation at 3 am .
i find it too hard to understand what i 'm feeling at any one time .
what i do know if that it 's rarely very positive .
i feel like if the opportunity presented itself to easily die i would n't hesitate for very long .
i 'm not very practised in understanding my own emotions .
when i went to therapy for it i was given the traumatic childhood explanation which definitely fits .
the point is that its more difficult than it should be .
i do n't trust any of my friends completely .
i do n't believe anyone who says that they care for me or would miss me .
this might be why i have a huge urge to lie about anything to do with me or for anything serious although i 've managed to cut down on the actual lies .
it 's probably because it buys me sympathetic attention or just attention in general .
i have been treated like i am not worthy of attention by someone i used to have great respect for and would have done anything if i knew it would lead to them spending time with me .
i do n't know in what way to interact or generally view them anymore .
i am not good enough at what i am learning to hold a candle to everyone i know .
i 'm essentially waste of any resource i use up to exist and work .
i do n't know if i 'm going to try to commit suicide but i do n't see many reasons not to at least try at this point .
if i survived people might lie to me a little more convincingly about how important i am in this world .
thanks for reading all this for anyone who did of course .
i 'm rerunning some wires in my living room and before they had a light switch with a black and white wire tied together .
i want to do the same thing for a light on a fan .

this article talks about women who have been messaged and often harassed on instagram by men that they did n't match with on tinder .
some of the men argue that this is n't creepy sense with tinder there 's no guarantee that a person whose profile they like we 'll ever see their profile and liked them back .
but most of the women do not appreciate this attention at all .
what do you think of the idea of messaging somebody that you encountered on tinder if they had their instagram profile or other social media profile linked to their tinder profile. ?
if somebody messaged you on a social media platform that they found through your dating profile would you appreciate the attention or would you think it is creepy and would you block them or even report them or even get the police involved in the most severe of cases or in other words how would you feel and react ?

most stuff look like it 's all just cut up into separate words with no context and translated word for word by google translate .
lots of the text makes no sense what so fu**ing ever .
that and the fact that more than half the text is n't already translated just makes this pointless .
if you ask me the translations should all be thrown out .
wipe the sheet clean and kick the proofreaders '' .
this half-assed lazy attempt '' at translating into norwegian '' sucks so bad that very few tings actually make sense .
because if you know how that works you can translate each word back to english in your head just to get what it actually means ...
this is more like lorem ipsum but with random norwegian words instead of random latin words ...
this just alternates between confusing amusing annoying and incomprehensible ...
for example i have spooky scary skeleton as one of my lenses and when i send it out it does n't play the song yet when my friend sends his out he has music that plays with it .

here 's mine heckapoo and adult marco are in dire need to fight a massive cthulhu-esc squid like monster .

i have a computer with 8 gb of ram and an i7 processor in front of me and chrome takes 3 minutes to load the first page on launch .
after i get a page to launch everything runs just fine but the first page of that chrome session takes way too long .
if i disable the grammarly extension the first page loads right away .
if i enable it again the next page even in the same session takes 3 minutes again .
i tried resetting chrome settings removing and reinstalling the extension and the problem still happens .

a lot of the products are old timeless even but some seem to be totally brand new .
i found a few items the other day and had an extremely good feeling about them and bought them immdeiately .
the shopkeeper told me i had a good eye .
first they acted as x-ray vision and could see through clothes .
second they could read people 's minds as well as list out their fetishes .
the second was a modern tablet device but only had the one app that it could never switch off of .
however whenever something is written in it it would effect the target 's body with no limitations .
a stone relic with a spiral in the middle .
when held by someone the first person they think of will be under their control .
the spiral will also glow bright pink and can only be linked to one person at a time .
and when i got back to my college dorm i had quite a lot planned for this ...
id like to use these devices on celebrites cosplayers and even people i know !
of course im open to losing a few of them and having them used against me as well !

i rent a room from a family member and that family member is away for a few nights normally i would 've taken a few days off of work and spent those nights drinking .
i really do n't like having the house to myself it makes me feel super alone but the drinking helped stop that feeling .
i did n't take any time off of work this time and i 'm not drinking to fight off the loneliness and i 'm proud of that .
i just wanted to get that off my chest .
the sore throat voice loss and tiredness have gotten better but are still present .
the part that has us confused is that her temperature is staying at 96.6-97.1 for a few days .
background we started dating 3 years ago after being friends for much longer .
when we started we were long distance but i had a career here and she had a job she hated where she lived ... so she moved in with me .
she 's had a couple of jobs here but nothing career '' oriented even though she has a degree .
things in the first couple of years were pretty awesome though .
we got along great and moved past the bumps of cohabitation and early dating pretty well .
since she 's moved here my career has constantly been moving forward and i am in basically my dream job whereas she hates hers and has been looking but finding nothing .
my job has paid for a house as well as most of the bills for both of us since she 's moved here as well .
i would n't normally give a second thought to paying the bills i mean i love her so what 's mine is hers ... but she absolutely hates it .
she says she feels like shit because she can never help with anything and that she ca n't do any of the things she wants to hobbies etc .
i 've tried to be really supportive of everything she wants to do and help her with anything she shows interest in helping with hobbies going on trips getting her flowers cooking dinner etc but i ca n't help but feel it just makes her more depressed and in turn resent me more .
this has all manifested itself with her being sullen and angry about little things all the time .
i feel like i 'm walking on eggshells around her and half the time feel like she does n't even like me anymore .
at times i feel like if i were on fire she would stand there and tell me why it was my fault and why i was wrong for wanting to be put out .
i 've brought this up multiple times in the past year when i finally get frustrated and things boil over and it always seems to turn from my concerns and questions to her crying and saying how shitty she feels .
i love her with all my heart and want her to be happy and healthy but i 'm finding myself frustrated bordering on miserable a lot now which is making things all the more difficult .
i want us both to work at fixing things and moving back to a healthy relationship but i have no idea how .
what in the flying fuck do i do reddit ?
tldr i have career girlfriend doesnt but has been looking to no avail ... pretty sure she resents me and it 's slowly tearing us apart
unfortunately my wife left our super mario odyssey edition switch on an american airlines flight from new orleans to charlotte nc .
the games on it all digital are botw odyssey xc:2 splatoon 2 mk8 and several indie games including golf story steamworld dig 2 enter the gungeon and stardew valley .
the switch is in the red case that came with the mario edition https imgur.com/a/tchv7 and is somewhere on the plane .
unfortunately i 'm betting it 's someone 's lucky day but if one of you happen to have found it please send me a private message .
lastly assuming i do n't get it back are my digital titles lost as well ?
i work at a boarding school live and work in the same place so i 'm lucky to be able to get back and let my dog out fairly frequently but i wanted some feedback on the general schedule i follow because i often feel bad that my dog is alone .
i usually take my dog out four times between 630 am and 130pm and each time i take him out he gets to play with my neighbor 's dog as well which is great exercise because they run around together .
then i have to leave him from 130 until about 430 and have fewer obligations after that .
again he is usually out with my neighbor 's dog running around so he gets a good amount of exercise .
by the way he is a five month old golden retriever and has n't had an accident in quite a while .
when i told some of my friends i did n't want them to act differently or change their behavior a lot because i feel i 'm still the same person no matter who i like .
so i saw this post https www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards/comments/6opdgw/dsa_wolf_mark_on_dz60 awhile back and i love the layout .
but i just want to make sure i can find the correct size caps to use for the split spacebar .
i was planning on buying the pcb from kbdfans and i saw that they have the 2u dsa spacebar for 1 https kbdfans.myshopify.com/collections/keycaps/products/dsa-blank-2u-spacebar ? variant=2637089636365 if i was to buy 2 of those would that be the correct size to fit in those spaces ?
also would i have to buy additional spacers for that layout ?
i 'm fairly new to cosplaying and do n't know much about fabrics .
i 'm working on a merida from disney 's brave cosplay and i 'm looking for a fabric to make the dress possibly something that looks like wool broadcloth ?
i was hoping for something cheaper though because everything i 've seen online is 20-40/yd .
does anyone else have experience with this or advise ?
first when i first report a nest on the atlas it presents me with the big panel containing little images of all the species and i have to select something .
but once i 've selected a nest point afterwards i have to re-select the species from a dropdown list of species names .
it 'd be nice to bypass that first panel but at least it 's only shown the first time i click report a nest .
second two of the nests i encountered tonight were poison types under a cloudy sky .
the tentacool could have been simply weather-boosted spawns the qwilfish was probably not .
it would be a cool feature to request the weather during the visit and perhaps somehow indicate that the report may be .
so does that mean 22:10 01:33 superimposed on 33:10 01:22 ?
i just got you to think in a non-conventional way by making it so you had to take what is 'conventional ' to you miniaturize it then apply it realistically/non-tangibly to the 'what-is ' that for all explanatory purpose s not '' and/or what-is-not '' ...

nuclear weapons capability of wiping out the enemy is a hoax undeniable evidence
nuclear weapons supposedly wipe out anything in a mile radius from the epicenter .
nuclear weapons have less destructive power than conventional mega bombs which is how hiroshima and nagasaki were really bombed .
nuclear war does n't mean instantaneously leveling the targeted country .
1 46 hiroshima and nagasaki real documents reveal that classic mega bombs was what was really used .
omission of expected footage starting with aerial overview to cover-up the hoax .
2 46 illuminati did n't launch a nuclear strike against the soviet union after world war ii
had the atomic bomb 's capacity to destroy the enemy not been a hoax then this is what should have been logically expected in order to prevent stalin from also getting nukes .
the soviet union created by illuminati agent lenin in reality an ethnic german would fall again under their control shortly after stalin 's death .
that 's when the nuclear weapons hoax was extended from if you have it then you have it all '' to nuclear deterrence mutual assured destruction '' .
this was one of core hoaxes used to brainwash the global audience ever since .
yet there is one decisive consequence of its massive use slowly burning humans around the globe with radiation .
to stop stalin who had just declared war on japan what would lead to a communist japan within weeks same as what happened im east europe after the arrival of the red army .
hiroshima and nagasaki were destroyed with conventional mega bombs not with atomic bombs .
the bigger the lie the more people will believe it .
00:25 to 00:50 http www.youtube.com/watch ? v=h9amtueydp0 t=0m25s footage is faked exposed immediately by inconsistencies of what is supposedly filmed with different cameras .

i 'd like to get the community 's thoughts on an idea for managing security of wallets .
likely this idea is either stupid or already well-known i apologize for either case .
security of keys in ethereum crypto generally is problematic .
to avoid theft we need to keep our keys as guarded as possible however to avoid loss we need to make sure our keys or recovery mnemonics are written down in multiple locations known to us .
there is no practical difference between having your key stolen and losing/forgetting your key your currency is lost without recourse .
from a theft perspective it is best to not keep your keys written down anywhere and from a loss perspective it is best to tattoo your keys on your forehead .
i 'm thinking of solving this with a kind of chain of limited trust '' colt to make it easier here .
what if i were to spread my key out among a number of people let 's say 8 in my trusted social circle who would then entrust me with a portion of their private key ?
for purposes of this example i 'll assume all in the colt are using hardware wallets and have written down their 24-word mnemonic .
i order my colt alphabetically they are listed with their wallet addresses
i then give 3 mnemonic words to each of them beginning with alice mnemonics 1 2 and 3 through harold mnemonics 22 23 and 24 .
it 's not completely safe for my colt to write these down and keep them so they 're going to store these words for me on the blockchain so they 're never lost .
the words will be sha-256 or keccak encrypted using their own private key as salt before going onto the blockchain so only they will be able to retrieve them .
now a hardware wallet does not expose a private key and the goal is for nobody to know their own private keys anyway .
instead of using the key itself as the salt for the hash we can use a signed transaction id with the following fixed parameters to make it deterministic
to address address of next person in the colt so alice uses bob 's address harold uses alice 's etc .
nonce same as 'to address ' not sure about this depends on the data type of nonce because we do n't want overflows just want to ensure it 's unique and deterministic
using the hardware wallet we can sign the transaction above offline then hash the following concatenated string
once the hash is created the transaction id is deleted .
this resulting hash is stored on the blockchain it can either go into a contract somewhere or be transaction data whatever .
just so long as it can be found later .
this setup is done for every one of the colt resulting in 24 x 9 hashes stored on the blockchain .
everyone then destroys the sheet where they 've written down their mnemonics .
in the best case scenario nobody ever loses their hardware wallet or forgets their pin code .
when someone does need their mnemonic however either because they 've lost or are locked out of their wallet their account was somehow compromised pin leaked or they just got a shiny new ledger they 'd like to initialize the following can be done
the colt everyone except for the person who needs their mnemonic restored re-create the transaction id with the same parameters as above .
then they iterate through the list of mnemonic words from bip-39 concatenating the mnemonic index and transaction id and hashing until they match what was originally stored on the blockchain .
each one in the colt then provides the mnemonic words back to the one person needing a restore .
if the account was actually compromised and not just lost the colt must now assume that the attacker possesses 3 of their 24 mnemonic words and all should transfer their funds to another wallet and start again with newly initialized hardware wallets .
it will be somewhat problematic if multiple individuals in the colt lose access to their wallet at the same time .
2 is probably reasonable because each one of the two will be able to recover 21 of 24 words and a program can be written simply to brute-force the other 3 in not a terribly long time .
3 losing access simultaneously is harder i do n't know how long it would take to brute-force 6 mnemonic words but it could be unreasonable unless some serious computing power were devoted to the task .
to guard against this i 'd propose using a canary perhaps bi-monthly so everyone is always aware of whether their colt is in control of their wallets .
it kind of goes without saying that all of these steps would be automated with simple applications some offline instead of having people do all of these steps by hand .
sorry for the long post but this is something i 've been thinking of and am curious to get some feedback on viability and whether there are massive holes i 'm missing .
yes trust is involved but i know for myself there are others in my life who i would certainly trust with a portion of my private key .
not sure if this has been asked yet but basically the title if the weather is partly cloudy will ttar or snorlax be more common raids bosses compared to others ?
it 's probably confirmation bias but it seems like more raids are water type like poliwrath or omastar when it 's raining and every tier 4 is a victreebel when it 's sunny .

my friends do n't care no one reaches out to me .
i have tried talking to them before but the way i grew up is so different than them and they do n't see that how i 'm feeling is real .
i do n't have the support from family that they did and when i speak to them about it they brush it off like its a joke .
it is already hard to try to open up to anyone and when no ones cares when i finally do it makes me feel even worst .
its embarrassing that im 26 and i feel this way .
and i know every time i talk to someone about it they just judge me .
i try to keep it to myself and it eats me alive .
i still have n't left my house in over a week nor slept .
but i 'm scared of messing up and being a vegetable .
the holidays sucked like always bc it was just me and my puppy .
i lost my job in november my car got repossessed last week ill be evicted in the next couple of days .
i 've resorted to the internet community for support to hopefully find a reason to keep going .
my deprrssion and anxiety has pushed away the few people in my life that made me feel like things would be better .
im tired of acting like i 'm happy just to fit in with everyone .
the truth is on the outside i am a good looking guy intelligent and hardworking that 's what i portray .
its like being in quick sand the harder i try the deeper i sink .
i 'm working on a project which basically consists of a solar panel charging a lead acid battery .

when you first play it you get actual vertigo over standing on a precipice walking a log over a ravine or climbing a cliff and running out of stamina .
during this you work your way into enemies who are beatable with persistence then you ramp up and learn all sorts of strategies weapon skills etc and get totally swatted by a moblin guardian molduga lynel etc .
you work at it and learn how to deal with them and eventually find that level as commonplace .
next you pick up the dlc and attack it in master mode .
you find that you did n't know the skills as well as you thought you did so you perfect them through persistence .
after a while you notice that you do n't really need all the heavy armor buffs etc and to make it more challenging you slowly stop using them .
now start a new normal level game from scratch after all that .
in breath of the wild you are so immersed that it 's you the player who are advanced not the armor weapons hearts or stamina .
you are the hero in the game who advances .
i think that 's why people who beat the game complained the most about the dlc .
the game had advanced them and they wanted more .
basically an argument i had with my old protestant youth pastor hinges on this .

one of my new rats i 've only had them for a week needs antibiotics for respiratory issues .
problem is she 's very shy and refuses to lick anything off my hand or even a spoon i 'm holding or out of a syringe .
the doxycycline is strawberry-flavoured to begin with and all my other rats love it including her sister .
i 've tried mixing it with peanut butter chocolate sauce and yogurt to no avail .
i 've tried leaving her alone in the traveling cage with the medication in a spoon too but she wo n't eat it then either i think because she hates the travelling cage .
i eventually rubbed it onto her fur and made sure she groomed it off .
but this does n't seem very efficient and i have to do this twice a day .
i 'm worried if i try to force-feed her she 's basically going to be a terrified rat and hate me forever .
i worry i 've sabotaged my relationship with her just trying to catch her to take her to the vet and then today i was chasing her around trying to get her to take her meds and then she escaped the cage and i had to chase her down to put her back ... she basically runs away from my hands now .
i knew when i adopted these rats that they would be skittish and she 's the most skittish of the lot but i was n't anticipating having to medicate a rat who 's just plain scared of me .
i have witnessed this rat enjoying corn yogurt and chocolate but she wo n't take it from me and she wo n't take it with medication in it .
when i give her treats she 'll never take things from me directly .
i just sort of drop it nearby her and i see her eating it later .
but i ca n't do that with her meds because she lives with a bunch of other rats and they would all love to eat her meds .

yesterday i flew from beijing to kuala lumpur on my way to thailand for vacation .
8 hour layover so i decided to leave the airport and go to the city for a few hours .
there were no smoking signs but other people were smoking in the vicinity so i stupidly decided to light one up .
not even 1 minute later a police officer came up to me .
he asked for my passport and told me that the penalty for smoking in a no smoking area in malaysia is 10000 mr or 2 years in jail .
he kept on saying that we could either deal with it here or that he could give me the fine detain me for the night causing me to miss my flight then i could explain my case to a magistrate the next morning .
i argued and pleaded with him but he kept on saying things like when you 're in malaysia you have to respect malaysian laws and what do you want to do to take care of this right here ? .
eventually i said are you asking for a bribe ?
because i do n't really believe in that sorry. shortly after that another cop came up with a piece of paper .
the main guy said were scheduling you for court if you do n't show up do n't be surprised if you have problems coming to malaysia in the future .
he did n't give me any kind of paper citation or a court date or anything .
got my flight without any problems later that night .
was he telling the truth or just trying to scare me so i 'd give him money ?
is there a chance i might have problems going to malaysia in the future ?
if so how do i find out and deal with it ?

got curious about the talk from the latest vid and holy crap i just finished watching a ghost story and its possibly one of the best films i 've seen in my life .

recently i bought a new 4k tv forcing me to replace my pc 's display card with one that supports hdmi 2.0 and 4k output i got an evga nvidia 1030 .

however rebooting the pc solves the issue for a few days .

say a character gets their eyes replaced with magical eyes .
these new eyes have the same property of a pair of goggles of night .
it might be op because it 's much harder to lose your eyes than some goggles .
it might be up because having odd magical eyes makes it harder to blend into a crowd .
it might be negligible because the above only come into play in rare situations .
also if an item that requires attunement is being converted into a prosthesis should the prosthesis version still require attunement ?
it 's not like characters are going to trade eyes a lot but would that make the item op because it 's one downside is now gone ?

that being said working for a usao even in ohio is a great experience and you can spin that very positively down the line when you work for biglaw .
pi/government jobs tend to give 1ls a chance to do a lot of substantive work that they could n't do elsewhere and obviously that 's a huge positive .
biglaw hiring partners know that there are very very few 1l firm jobs and they really just want you to do something legal and productive your first summer .
being in oh wo n't tie you down to working in oh forever especially if you have demonstrable ties elsewhere .
right ... so does n't that mean it 's worse than it seems ?
you said it 's not as bad as it seems .

i definitely think flats are trimmer than prefolds but i suppose that could vary based on the fold you use .
i have gmd muslin gmd birdseye and flour sack towels that i have used as flats .
out of those the muslin are my hands down fave so i think they 're a great choice !
as someone else mentioned you can buy individual flats from gmd so you can always get just 1 or 2 to try out .
my ex got our cat that we adopted together .
i went by to drop off some stuff one day and he just kept meowing and pawing at the window when he saw me .
even though the dog we adopted is still with me sometimes i look at her and just get angry because she 's a representation of what my old life was .
but i can never actually be angry because she 's my little buddy .
so she kept the cat and i kept the dog and i think i might miss the cat more than my ex .
i kinda want both of them back but i 'm in nc and ca n't see pics or see how he is either .
i blocked her on snapchat where we both usually post our pets so i have nothing .

and yet you 've continued to argue as if what he stated pre-election is what actually occurred .
and he was so hostile to human spaceflight that he proposed budgets that increased funding for commercial crew every year .
and again go compare what he said 12 months before election and what his actual budget requests were .
and remember the proposed budget is simply a slow ball pitched to congress so they can easily modify it for their own pork purposes etc .
if his intent was to delay sls then compare the '07 request https www.nasa.gov/pdf/142458main_fy07_budget_full.pdf to the '09 request https www.nasa.gov/pdf/210019main_nasa_fy09_budget_estimates.pdf .
'constellation systems ' got 3.06b in the '07 request .
'constellation systems ' got 3.05b in the '09 request .
'constellation systems ' got 3.5b in the '10 request plus a further 0.4b recovery act .
that 's more than 800 million above the '07 budget .
in 2011 https www.nasa.gov/pdf/428837main_nasa_fy_2011_congressional_justificaton_budget_book_rev-01_bookmarked.pdf the money moves from constellation to constellation transition and exploration research and
development '' a total of 3.45b and added 812m for commercial spaceflight .
that 's before congress even got its hands on the budget .
so cut the bullshit about obama trying to kill ares v sls and human spaceflight .
his budget requests state no such attempt was made .
nah he brought it up to us.. it 's 4000 per associate and comes straight out of the bottom line.. turnover is a company wide push right now

without clicking the link i figured it 'd be paul tassi .

i actually never bought dkctf so i 'm excited to be able to play it on the switch now .
but in general i 'm excited there are ports for some of the best wii u games coming to switch .
the wii u had its problems but there were some truly great games on it that deserve to be played .
if i do n't want to buy them again i 'll play them on my wii u .
but for the millions of people that ignored the wii u this helps give the switch a giant library of great games .
it 's probably hardly any effort at all for nintendo to bring these ports over and it just adds to the value proposition for the switch .
you do realize that property is a set of legal norms right ?

i know my sorority on a national level had rules that you could not be in as a married woman .

the case seems to hinge on whether the sending of the letter requires a trigger outside of not voting or if non-voting itself can be the trigger .
i heard this angle in a debate as well .
the person defending the state did n't say specifically what triggers it but in my mind the unintended consequence regardless is going to be that some legally registered voters will be thrown off the rolls .
it speaks volumes to the makeup of this court that they 're likely to side with some people losing the right to vote instead of messy rolls .

consider this ... you could use the credits in many ways to earn plat .
fully upgraded serration a newer player may spend plat to buy this from you .
i tried to trade for 2100 plat last night and it cost me over 1mil credits in trade tax .
your credits literally translate into earning plat in various ways .
fully upgraded primes rivens and such all cost a lot of endo and credits .
the only time when you can probably honestly say your credits are useless is when you have bought everything available in the store leveled up every weapon to full mastery and leveled every warframe and bought every stance/armor/upgrade/color pallet etc .
once you 've done that that is when you can say you 've done everything and by then you 've likely spent 2000 hours in the game .
id say pretty worthwhile if you can say you 've enjoyed your time .

on the contrary we teach that your baptism is valid despite the preacher .
if i got baptized by fred phelps or john shelby spong it would still be valid because the thing that counts is the water and god 's word that says whoever believes and is baptized will be saved '' mark 16:16
the view of baptism by christ is attested in the new testament in colossians 2:11-12 where it says that baptism is a circumcision not made by hands a circumcision of christ .

had never heard of them but they 'll be the first thing i listen to when i get home today .
seems to me lots of comments are based on fallacies .
they do n't get taken seriously because they literally call themselves anarcho-capitalists .
i 'm just reacting to it the same as anyone else .
i 'm a huge twice fan and buy their albums and merch even though they have n't debuted in my country .
i watch other streamers who are kind of at their level and basically they in their respective streams just steamroll other players .
i rarely ever see their opponents build like ninja and daequan built in this battle making battles end in mere seconds .
i know it 'll be lit when more matches like this become the norm in streams of players who just great at the game .
for me elite packs were some of the best packs gold premium probably best overall then to open at the beginning of the game a guaranteed 80 or above was worth its weight .
the fact that they still cost 900 points a piece and you likely to pull a similar pack to ones you did at the start of the game make them completely irrelevant now .
mine looks more like yours when it 's a bit more moisturized .
i consider my hair 2c/3a and i would agree with that for yours .
i cut my own hair with devacut techniques from the curly girl handbook .
it gives me a lot more curls/waves and volume at the root which i think would benefit you as well !
since your hair is so similar to mine i 'd love to compare routine and products !

the action is really hard to follow because the video stream 's limited bitrate causes all the fast movements to be super blurry/blocky .

really do n't think he was that good to begin with ... i think he 'll be worse than zaha as a player eventually i 'm not comparing their attributes just their ceiling/potential and zaha is the borderline of 'talented ' where i think he might make a difference on a top 4 team and being a regular starter for a mid-low table team and iwobi will probably turn out to be a decent player for a club like swansea ... to me that 's not really 'talented '
it seems the general consensus in the current housing landscape is that if you are in a hcol it probably does n't make sense to buy a house at current valuations .
however in mid to low cost of living areas it almost always does make sense to buy a house if you plan on staying put for 5 years or more particularly if you look at rent prices and they are more or less the same as a mortgage .
yes you have some additional costs but you will build equity in an asset that appreciates with inflation but due to leverage with a mortgage it is a very great way to hedge against inflation while also building your net worth .

at work on my phone so no time to look those up but they were everywhere right as the book came out .
i listed what i got on a quick google search .
anti trumpers and libs say it 's true enough trumpers say it 's propaganda commissioned by the dnc in violation of campaign laws .
libs will believe it and defend it because it backs what they already believe pubs will say it 's filled with lies so we ca n't believe any of it without third party corroboration .

i 'm fairly sure ramza is not that good on 10 man trials when singing because it basically locks his position in for 3 turns when he starts using that song .

i did my crying when i found out he had dementia grieving for the uncle i knew through my childhood .
the person who died had n't been him for a while and he was a huge burden to my aunt in the last couple of years he would get distressed if she left his side she was basically a prisoner in her own home .
as others have said everyone even nts might not respond to a loss the way they are supposed to '' .
that 's because they way we are supposed to '' respond is a very narrow victorian concept which only really took hold in the late 19th century .

i 'd infodump on the victorian obsession with death but this is neither the time nor the place

so before i start rambling quick disclaimer i do n't fly professionally but i 've been quite close to selection processes like this and i 've run a few assessment centers from the other side '' so to speak .
so just a few comments from a risk management perspective .
the severity of the outcome is quite high if you fail that 's it no more chance at least for swiss .
if you pass on you get exactly what you say you need a few months off where you can prepare be rested and go for it again with no consequences .
then again if you take a few months off you will not only marinate in your nervousness but if you completely switch off it 's going to be mighty difficult to get your mind focused when it 's time eventually .
theres this https media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/p/4/005/0ac/198/3242fe1.png fancy performance over pressure graph which looks like complete management bollocks but it is absolutely true .
i 'd assume youre on the right of that graph question is will five months off put you all the way to the left ?
or can you find a few days to rest prepare and get on your game to put you right in the middle ?
next thing say you get accepted that does n't mean you now have a guaranteed right seat assigned with an a3xx type rating in a few years time .
the training schedule is quite pacey at least compared to a non-company program because wasting time on training is wasting money the quicker you are done the more they 'll get out of you .
that means there will be periods of high stress along the training you 'll have to cope with and if you continue to fuck up they will seed you out of the program .
if you are stressed out now already i would go find out when the syllabus starts because once it does you 'll kick right off in tie and shirt at 7am every day in grenchen flying da42s to get your me-ifr just to start .

i would still be a 14 y/o who had a dream .
being that age i would have remembered the dream in detail but also being ignorant of the future would ignore the implications althought i believe a nightmare of something which recurs would have more impact on my actions .

at my uni we had a 'refreshers ' fair like a smaller societies and sports fair in january and always had lots of new people join at this time of year we also had people start throughout the year who did n't come from a fair just wanted to try it .

societies really are the best way to meet people .
it does vary some societies are n't as active as others but you can try another .
some will be more active with weekend trips some with mid week stuff some will do stuff on both .
your engineering course probably has a society too which might help you make friends on your course .
you are n't too late you can join stuff and make friends at any point while you 're at uni .
tbh my first couple of months at uni were miserable and i thought about dropping out did n't get along with my flatmates had spoke to maybe 3 people on my course but did n't get the impression they liked me much and while i 'd joined the mountaineering club as soon as i arrived i did n't know anyone and was a bit shy but after a few months i made friends with people i 'm still friends with now 12 years later .

i went to the police about my abusive parent and it took me years of being afraid to or thinking it was n't big enough of a deal or whatever .

i 've got hakuro on that duty at grade 3 she 's doing about 1500-2500 damage to enemies but it 's not quite enough yet .
once we'v upgraded a few shiki 's to tier 4 i expect we 'll have an easier time outpacing the enemies and taking them down fast enough .
well i was the one who counted after him so it was my fault .
map reduce would exactly lead you to the right tools .
you would n't load 11m record into a single application memory on a single node of 16g memory as you suggested earlier .
if i can fit it in 1/4 of the available ram and do the computations in 3 seconds hell yes i would .
map reduce are done via the right tools such as emr or self hosted pig/hive+hadoop clusters which typically have applications in java not php/nodejs/redis per linked .
you 're really good at wasting your employer 's money and time huh ...
i started this thread with the very notion i 'm using existing logic implemented for a website but i 'm calling those php apis outside the web server in a cron job .
nope let 's throw all this out rewrite it in java and maintain two solutions !
while we 're at it i propose we build the cluster with xeon e7 and wire it all with optical interconnect .
if we do all this right even after distributing all this data around a bunch of machines despite it fits in 1/4 of the ram of one machine we 'll be able to bring the processing time to around 5-6 seconds which is almost as fast as the single node php solution !
again i 'm huge on leveraging the right tools for the right job .
not so much the right tools for the job .
i said something twice above and you did n't get the message it seems .
i made the app much faster than anyone could imagine given the previous proper '' implementation .
i did this by stuffing things in ram and caching what i can cache not all but some to disk .
you have nothing to attack this solution with other than empty claims that i 'm not doing it right '' .
nobody made you the mayor of right '' so that 's how much your word is worth .
the amount of hardware software and services to maintain you want to blindly cram into such a project despite you know nothing about it just says you 're a giant liability for your employer .

why would you give a purple gun designed to destroy bases unlimited ammo in the form of light bullets ?

is it weird that it reminded me of half-life ?
you start alone and confused part of an experiment gone bad and faced with the aftermath .
as you go through the game you explore the disasters happening in the facility discovering what happened and what needs to be done .
you run into actual survivors later in the game which surprised me .
the security force that comes to kill everything is like the marines in halflife .
the auto turrets were at the beginning of the game were barney giving you a hand and some relief in firefights .
exploring different parts of talos was like exploring black mesa .
it definitely felt like system shock and bioshock but half-life really felt like an influence for me .
i had the same excitement playing and exploring this game as i did half-life back in the day .
i loved it and i 'll have to play it again .

the click through rate may be 1 — so 10 people click on the ad .
that hotel booking is worth 200 and the hotel makes 20 of profit on the booking .
so for 3 investment the hotel makes 20 profit even though the ad got clicked on only 1 of the time .

how can you say the a280 stomps the el16 in long range if the el16 literally has better stats than 2 of 4 snipers .
almost the same as the iqa but with faaaar less recoil .
i have full mods for all blasters and while i agree that the a280 might be better in cqc the higher recoil and lower damage of the a280 make it worse at medium and long range .

the kia is going to drop value like a cinder block being thrown off a bridge especially with it being a top of the line model .
32k new and private party after a year will be around 20k and do n't even ask about trade in ... ..
the flipside is that kia dealers will more likely bargain with you ...
honda accord will be much better in resale value and considering its 2 model years newer 2018 redesign vs 2016 for the kia it will have more tech features .
but honda dealers are gon na sell them close to msrp with them being so new and the financing rates will be higher .
i would go honda accord if new as it is a better car '' and overall better value at msrp .
but if you can get that kia down under 27-28k that might be worth the lower brand value driving dynamics and feature content ...
only 2 sissies out of you actually sent a picture like i said .
she did n't realize how permanent it was until afterwards .
initially i thought he threw change at the crowd and that made me laugh .
later i realized that this is not what happened and i was slightly bummed .
round 1 if they are in-character than i can convince them to at least not attack from friends and hopefully help me rescue them .
i think holland would at least agree with me and i might be able to get garfield so agree as well .
they both convince macguire and i save my friends while being a bad ass with a shotgun .
my friend gets rescued and at least one of us maybe gets shot .
round 2 this might difficult so i will have to come up with a convincing lie which i 'm actually pretty good at .
i lie through my teeth and convince them that macguire lost his god damn mind .
we three take him down before he gets to my friends and kills them .
i tase him in the back and garfield and holland punch him and knock him out .
my friends are safe and hopefully everyone is alright .
i scream why the fuck are you messing up my book club ? ''
i think that would honestly shock them for a second and i can use my skill of lying to stop them from beating the shit out of me and everyone else .

i honestly do n't know how to put that in context i just wanted to post it .

why would someone send a colorblind person to pick out what seemed to be a very specific color for a project ?
he identified light blue and a few other colors in my stack of papers with accuracy
if i remember correctly most color blindness is red/green colorblind however he was easily able to pick out the difference between pink and red and talked about the shade and warmth
so unless you mean he was colorblind in his soul and not just his retinas then no i do n't think he was colorblind

using freedom of speech to condemn a country that you have very little control over is a massive opportunity cost compared to using those powers to make change in your own country .
the us routinely assassinates people in different countries because of political views .
we drone strike all over the place we do special ops raids all over the place .
no trial or anything which pushes the rule of law back before the 13th century magna carta .
but if you 're an american and ostensibly live in a democracy with free speech and you use that to speak out against a country you have no control over it 's not only intellectually lazy it 's also more or less politically impotent .
americans have the ability to raise hell and clean up our act by speaking our and holding our leaders accountable .

i know i 'm preaching to the choir here but just wanted to throw this out there even if reusable bags take more water energy to make plastic bags are still worse .
they may be a small portion of land fills but how many bags do n't end up in landfills at all ?
plastic bags are terrible for the animals that inevitably eat or get stuck in them .
although i will agree that using paper bags is a false solution .
imo the best way is to make bags from things you already have t-shirts skirts old cloth or even tied up plastic bags plastic yarn https i.pinimg.com/736x/f9/e0/d3/f9e0d387164b28ad4b7a45dd5e35f3b6 plastic-shopping-bags-plastic-bags.jpg rather than buying new things .
also being careful about free bag giveaways just because they are more permanent than plastic does n't mean we get to be wasteful .
but he did n't get it done in the 4th tonight ... he was really bad actually haha .
he had the worst plus/minus on the team tonight and played 32 minutes .
there 's a reason why we never play him in the 4th and it 's because teams mostly go small and he ca n't switch out onto the perimeter at all defensively .
i love kanter but he has never been a good 4th quarter player due to his defensive deficiencies .
i do n't think kanter more in the 4th or ot would have won us this game .
we lost because we are awful at defending the 3 pointer and we were bad from the ft line .
in 2015 and last year with norv that was what killed us every damn week .
so many 7 step drops and deep routes that took way too long to develop .
granted cam has a cannon and can huck a quarter mile but our oline was just incapable of giving the qbs any time .
and every week we waited and hoped for him to make a change and implement some shorter routes ... but he never did .
maybe he 's changed things up a bit and adapted .
maybe your line will be better than ours was although that 's a low bar given the injuries last year in 2015 teddy was pressured on a higher of drop backs than cam was during the sb
and it 's also entirely possible that norv thrives with cam 's cannon arm .
i made a dragon class/race combo for one maybe two of my players who were very singleminded about their desire to play a dragon .

i 'd like to add serialization support for at least base_collection here https github.com/ebenezer-group/onwards
i think i 'd have to call is_registered for all derived types and then iterate over the segments of the types that are registered .
it might be a little inefficient if there were a lot of derived types and only a few of them are registered but not sure how often that happens .
... and that 's why i get my friends into it .
it 's pretty easy if you start off soft like with dear god and gunslinger then eventually make it to nightmare
hello i have a base class and i want to store instances of its derivatives in a collection of some sort .
and then ussing templates i created functions for each derivative and i tried passing in the derivatives like so
by doing so i found out about slicing https stackoverflow.com/questions/274626/what-is-object-slicing .
so instead i changed my map to take in pointers to my base class
but the problem i have is that all my objects are not created as pointers so i could not pass them in and i was getting errors .
no suitable conversion from number '' to variable '' exists .
due to my implementation i can only create instances of objects
please bear with me because this is a weird assignment .
we were asked to create a program that behaves/understands the syntax of a programming language called logo without actually analyzing the text as an input file but rather disguise '' it to appear as such while in fact we just use c using what we learned from c and lots of overloads and pre-processor tricks
we have to be able to make our own types '' of variables called number word boolean array list sentence .
to declare them we have to use note no semi-colons should be used
that 's just a small part we later have to support functions nested loops etc .
so do this i have to find a way to use the colon since i can not overload it so i did this
create an instance of number and write the first half of the ternary operator so we
always get the false value so we can use the like this
worked great and it actually gets replaced by the processor to this
so i worked with this for all my derivatives and i proceeded to overload operators to compare them implement if else function in a similarly weird syntax .
now i either have to figure out a way to make this work again but this time creating them as pointer instead or create a single class for all types but doing it in separate objects that all inherit from a single base class makes more sense to me .
and am not sure how strict they will be it is an unconventional project assignment for sure .
the reason i want to hold them together in a container is so i can then implement an array and list object that can hold every type .
at first i tried to use a different container for each type and made an iterator to iterate multiple maps separately but when i got to the list implementation things got weird .
the list syntax is using the brackets which can only get 1 input value so the idea was to collect them by overloading the comma operator and pass in one value to the list object .
i know this is weird thank you for your time

no matter how small the formation of infantry he commanded no matter how large or well entrenched the opposing enemy force if lewenhaupt had explicit orders he would dress ranks and advance with absolute serenity into murderous enemy fire .
his tragedy—and charles ' mistake—was that he was given a command which called for a wide latitude of personal initiative and improvisation .
critics have blamed lewenhaupt harshly for his excessive delays but he could not control the weather .
moving his heavy supply wagons with their great wheels churning in the mud proved almost impossible in the rain although fascines of brush branches and wooden boards were laid down .
lewenhaupt was even carrying a portable bridge the pride of his engineering corps held together with flexible strips of leather which became so sodden that thirty-two men had to carry each section and they could carry it only twenty paces before setting it down to rest .
how much of the delays were on him and how much of it was due to the weather and the roads ?
i could n't find anything else about it on the internet .
jokes aside i 'm really happy with how bch is performing right now .
i 'm actually one of the millions of folks which are in the 0.001 btc club '' right now i got pretty pissed knowing i ca n't even touch these as they ca n't even be considered a transaction fee .
so today i actually macgyver 'd my way through this and opened my wallet in electron cash instead just to see what would happen .
to my surprise i actually had around 0.0025 bch there ready for me to move them wherever i wanted i guess i actually had 0.0025 btc before the aug 1st fork but ended up spending some after that but before fees got this high .
what actually surprised me the most was the fact i could set transaction fees to 1 sat/byte i 've been reading posts here and i know some of you will say i can pay even less than that sorry i 'm still that new to bch so i had no idea .
moving this amount of bch from a wallet to another in what seemed to be 3 seconds with such low fees ... dude i 'm sold .
yeah i 'm sold i 'll embrace bch now along with ltc and although i do n't have any of the following eth and xmr i 'll put my faith in all of those for being the main cryptocurrencies in a not-so-distant future .
all of that said i still have my 0.001 btc there sitting in my wallet and i still ca n't move or spend them because fees are still high as fuck .
can anybody give me some tips on how to deal with this ?
had to sleep in someone elses seeing as i had to throw mine out ... ..i have to sign on to the dole today and the thought of it is making me want to shoot myself

i am looking to start a playthrough with a human or elf character that acts as a battlecleric/paladin .
i know that most builds suggest to max strength and warfare but i was wondering if splitting between strength and intelligence or strength and wits would make any sense .
for the human i am thinking wits to add to the already 5 increased crit chance .
for the elf split between strength and intelligence so i am able to use offensive spells too .
supposedly we are more outwardly playful than other types like infjs .
but when people want playfulness lightheartedness and goofiness intps also ca n't do it we only do that to a limited extent with those that we love .
so i 'm beginning to wonder if intps are just sort of not in tune or not held in place by the social rules for when to be playful and when to be serious .

unless others fill in the remainder of his curios i 'll update when i get home from a long friday 's day of work .
the media voice of our program matt jones and the entire ksr crew are looking into not only coming to roo but doing a remote broadcast on friday .
the fact that these two massively important areas of my life are about to cross over makes me think i 'm living in an alternate universe .
i was already hitting matt up on twitter to go when i saw tyler childers was coming .
any ksr fans out there also jumping out of their skin at this prospect ?
i have heard so much about octgn and i know how to set it up and everything but how do i get the dragon ball super cards onto it .
has anyone played the eyes of ara and have thoughts they 'd like to share ?
i 've had it on my list during 2017 and am thinking of circling back around but i never heard much discussion about it .
it 's fairly myst-like i gather but other than that i do n't know what 's cool about it .
is it a similar atmosphere or something else entirely ?
so i 've heard this rock song that i liked and noted down the lyrics confident that i 'll be able to find it but no amoint of google-fu helped me .
say what you want say what you will . ''
na na na na na na na na na '' many people chanting say '' then lots of na '' you get the point .
sadly i ca n't remember the actual melody since i was sure the lyrics would be enough but i remember it being kinda falloutboyish and it also reminded me of volbeat 's warrior 's call https youtu.be/2lg_k1swrq0 .
hole that 's enough and you guys can help me because it has really been bugging me .
things seem to be going well for you today !
do you need to get something off your chest ?
confessionals are any thoughts you might have about the game that you would like to share with the hosts .
these can be pertinent to your role your thoughts on who might be another role or general ideas about your strategy .
at the end of the game all confessionals will be visible to other players .

and i remembered how great this is especially with just a bit of black charred spots on the outside to make it just pop ...
i 've played and replayed through two districts now without getting detected and it wo n't pop .
i also loaded an old save beat the game again and played through the districts again .
i 'm about to beat it again and try again but i 'm not hopeful .
first real bug i 've even really encountered at this point .
was just able to download binance app again finally and log in !

175 range on a tank that has good waveclear and trading .
i already had problems winning trades vs him at the end of last season but it seems impossible to win trades while running klepto .
i 've even tried rushing titanic and just trying to out push him and roam but that did n't seem to work either .
what do you guys do vs ornn to win trades in s8 ?
riven normally i take klepto in melee matchups but it seems harder to proc in this lane since you can never jump on her to proc it since she will just kite you unless her abilities are on cooldown .
in addition to this not having a combat keystone seems to really show in this lane as i found it harder than normal to win trades .
if i 'm going to rush titanic and try to roam then there 's little point in going klepto since i wo n't proc it very often .
i 've tried running grasp once and it seemed to work but it was also against some noob tier riven .
what keystone do you guys opt for in this matchup ?
do you try to stay in lane or constantly shove and roam ?
i love the show for the complex and intriguing plot and everything else but i feel like something is missing when it comes to the characters .
i 'm not invested in a single one of them .
that emotional connection was missing and i feel like there was no-one to root for no favorite .
they really were just pawns on a chess board .
the game is an intriguing watch but i do n't really care what happens to the pawns .
even jonas who is supposed to be the protagonist did n't get me invested .
nothing about him made me care and i did n't really feel his conflict .
the only one that really sparked an emotional reaction was hannah what a nasty piece of work .
i 'm just left questioning why i should care for any one of them ?
it might be that there are so many characters too many to focus on that it 's hard to establish a feel for a single one .
or that the series deals with the darkness in humans and they 're all pretty grim .
and would also be greatful if some one looks at my settings and can help be fine tune .
prior to my last few prints it printed fine not sure if i messed up a setting .
as is says in the title which do you think is a better headset ?
i came to you guys because this is the most friendliest crypo reddit out there and i know you 'll help .
so ive been investing in a few altcoins but i 'm not sure where to store them .
i 've heard the exchange is n't safe and i like desktop wallets but it 's hard to find a good desktop wallet for alt coins .
how do i know where to create the paper wallet and know which currency it 'll except ?
and how do i get it back into an exchange once u wan na cash out on it .
can someone help or show me a good youtube video i watched a few but i still do n't u derstand it .

but i did n't remember that i had asked my previous doctor to send me my body fat from january 2017 just to measure and today she texted me back and my was waylower than my current body fat .
this means during 2017 i gained about 20 of body fat .
even though my total weight is only 2 kilos more than last january .
i 'm worried and anxious 😟 but well i 'm already in day 4 so at least i 'm not still daydreaming about creating a healthy life someday .
hoping someone can help me out so i can finally find out what 's wrong .
okay so basically what happens is that my forced-air gas furnace carrier installed 2004 keeps cycling exactly every 10 minutes with my nest e thermostat .
i turn up the heat fan furnace turn on as normal .
exactly every 10 minutes furnace turns off fan remains on for about a minute
then the fan also completely turns off for about 10 seconds
then everything turns back on for exactly another 10 minutes and the cycle starts again .
this makes it a very long time to heat up my house when i come home from work since the furnace keeps turning on/off every 10 min .
i 've literally spent all week searching for solutions online to no avail .
nest customer support was n't very helpful unfortunately although they did rma my first unit and sent me a replacement problem persists tho .

this week was exam week after not being able to fall asleep on the 8th of january i decided to stay awake and sacrifice the entire day to fix my sleep schedule is this good or not ? .
ever since then including the night of the 9th where i had gone about 40 hours without sleep i have n't been able to sleep for over 3-4 hours waking up without an alarm .
i 've been waking up fairly fresh but i am stressed out about this pattern carrying over even after the exams .
edit just to add context i 'm sleepy to the point where i 'm nearly fallling off my chair but i cant sleep for more than 4 hours

vehicles are still susceptible to flak while this affect is active .

just lost two games in a row to this so idk if there 's something i should be doing to try and prevent it or if it 's just bad luck
so i 'm laning as adc and i notice the enemy mid/top has a few kills on mine and not long after they start roaming bot and pressuring me out of lane or killing me soon after .
my own mid/top is reasonably far behind so we 're fighting at a disadvantage even if they follow up the roam .
what i 've been trying to do is fall back to tower and try to manage the pressure enough to farm under it to keep from falling behind in my own lane .
but if the champ has any dive potential this does n't really work and i end up either getting killed or giving away free turret damage .
should i try and get my team to group up and focus on taking out the fed champ ?
should i just try and keep the fed guy from getting any more kills on me or my support so my laner can get a chance to get farm on him ?
should i just leave lane and try and trade objectives instead of contesting them ?
i 've decided to upgrade the pc next to my tv to be able to handle witcher 3 .
i was surprised how well witcher 3 ran by just upgrading the video card to a gtx 1060 3gb card .
however there 's still moments when the game freezes as if it 's loading something but i do n't know if it 's a ram thing or a processor thing .
ram 8 gb not sure what kind but its 9 years old
so i 'm trying not to spend too much and dropping a gtx1060 was already pushing my overall budget on this .
what do you think is the bottleneck on causing this freezing while playing the game ?
the game runs pretty good with just the current set up marginally high graphics and get a clean 60fps in most situations .
is there an economical way of getting just a bit more out of this ?
if so can i do so without dropping another 300 ?

ok i am a white dude born and bred in the good old us of a .
and i am pissed about the blatant shameful fascism and racism coming from trump and supported by a solid third of this country .
i have a good friend that immigrated here from one of those shithole '' countries .
she is tall beautiful and about the nicest person i have ever met in my life .
she is also a skilled electrical engineer that is far far smarter and better for this country than trump and most of his supporters .
she has endured numerous incidents of hate and persecution since trump crawled out of his hole .
i love her and it hurts me when people attack her for her race her religion or her shithole country '' of birth .
ok people this behavior is not christian it is not american and it is not the behavior of a good person .
i do n't care what damn religion you are or are not .

sveden is long gone my friends arykal too has retreated to their eastern cave neither will ever again threaten our realms as could the great kings of old .
yet time and time again their peoples rise up only to beat against the drums of inevitability raids piracy and insults abound whenever we so much as turn our back from the blasted waste where once stood hararykal .
so much pain such inconvenience how much would you pay to see it gone forever ?
think of the price of svyndii the greatest of the vikingr tribes yet it fell like rotten wood at the drum-beat of our armies .
länteenmaa and ruotsi are all that remain and neither hold a candle to the might of sveden. ''
these are the rights of the eigva of our people blessed by our gods .
i call upon you give me the host once more and i shall deliver you the north. ''
though the host of the west had been dissolved after the conclusion of the svyndiian war the memory of that great apparatus had not expired from the states quite yet .
on request of the stadtholder aging hjorli a portion of that army was reconstituted in the form of a single great feld of thirty-thousand men .
led by a new sauler erhardt of kuelmaer the army was sent north there to crush any resistance left in the svedes that remained .
the legation states were not alone in this conquest the allied realms of helsingjabotn and nordheim held true to the terms of the new accords https www.reddit.com/r/historicalworldpowers/comments/7pweur/ylniashammerfesthelsingjabotn_axis marching in turn with a great army totaling twenty-thousand strong from the north .
the svedish chiefs were given no warning like a summer storm the armies swept down the western coast striking with lightning speed from knarr and longboat .
the city of trondheim greatest of the svedish holds left independent fell within a month their iron would now fall to legatine hand .
yet as the feld and its allies tried to move further into the east they found there resistance greater than they could have imagined the mighty march grinding to a halt .
two battles were lost thousands dying at each in the deep mountain passes that led to the fortified holdfasts of ruotsi when a full year had passed and summer come once more barely six towns had changed hands to eigva command .
in time the leaders of the three armies agreed to discuss terms with the chief of ruotsi surprisingly a settlement was reached with little fanfare or discord .
länteenmaa as expected would be annexed to the legation states as a mere kreis ruotsi however would be split between nordehim and the states in each to be granted an autonomy as before only allowed to former allies-at-arms .
for the chief of ruotsi this was survival for the allies this was a fulfillment of their promises made to their peoples a mighty victory only slightly tempered by the difficulties spent in achieving it .
update thanks for all of the positive support and comments !
a couple people asked for approach success stories i 'm going to start a new thread as soon as i have a few minutes .
i 've read quite a few posts on here from women interested in approaching guys .
i 'm going to unlock the secret to expanding your dating pool exponentially .
some women do n't approach because they have legitimate insecurity about something .
odds are we are n't going to notice it .
guys will think i 'm weird/needy/too forward if i approach .
the good part you can approach any guy anytime anywhere and start a conversation about anything .
99 of the time we will gladly talk to you .
however we do not get approached often and are not good at picking up subtle hints .
if dating is a battlefield you do n't have to be a hand grenade you 'll miss shots as a sniper so fix bayonets and cross no man 's land á la wonder woman .
example hi i see you like wearing t-shirts me too .
the guy will respond because we generally enjoy talking to people .
if you 're interested in him let 's grab a drink sometime .
some guys are in relationships not interested or possibly gay not that there 's anything wrong with that .
typically guys are going to soft reject you but still express appreciation for you coming over .
do n't take it personal just talk to that guy over there .
as long as you use words your odds of success increase by a factor of ten !
edit thanks u/haani for letting me know i forgot to add the secret !
as the title says i 'm looking for a team my main role is mid .
skill-wise i 'm about mid-plat level though i do n't play that much ranked about 40 games the last split so it 's probably best to just see for yourself .
would like to play more nu wa ah puch and stuff like that though lol
native language is german but my english is decent was b2 3 years ago maybe closer to c1 by now .
i would n't mind playing on a german team though i play the game on english so you 'd have to be okay with me calling stuff by its english name .
as for availability i 'm available almost every evening about 18/19 cet .
as for planning practice/scrims i can usually tell for about a week in advance when i wo n't be available rarely i 'll only be able to tell you a few hours in advance mostly caused by trains being stuck
mainly i 'm looking for a team that does n't make hasty decisions .
i do n't want to be told that i 'm in after one tryout and then get kicked 3 weeks later when half of the team gets replaced lol
i 'm looking for a team that has a set schedule takes practice serious and values building synergy over replacing people constantly .
what that also means is that i 'm not looking for a team that is aiming to enter the spl asap but rather a semi-competitive team that is fun to play in and to get better with

i 've read this today and it quickly reminded me of some gems we had..
didier drogba came into my life in the fifth minute of a champions league game in marseille 's mythical vélodrome .
i 'd hardly sat down when that giant with the 11 on his shirt scored .
he celebrated that goal like it was his last the crowd went mad the noise was deafening . ''
at half-time i found him in the tunnel and told him ‘i do n't have the money to buy you but do you have any cousins that can play like you in the ivory coast ? '
he laughed hugged me and said ‘one day you 'll be in a club which can buy me . ' ''
i had found a super powerful club which everybody wanted to negotiate with everybody wanted to be linked to – and everybody wanted to play for .
i had a number of options but i arrived and said ‘i want didier drogba . '
doubts and questions were raised by a few people ‘why this one ?
a few days passed and i met with didier in a private airport in london .
again he hugged me but this time in an unforgettable way an embrace that showed this man 's gratitude and the affection he feels towards people who mean a lot to him .
and that 's just what he 's done ... ''
his loyalty came out in his leadership and in the way he always faced up to the difficult moments .
moments when nothing else matters than to be there for your leader and your colleagues .
this was a person i knew i could count on whenever and wherever i needed . ''
when the team was under pressure he would help defend when he felt pain he would stretch himself to the limit and then of course came what he did best scoring goals .
those goals brought him titles awards but what stays with me are the countless stories we have together . ''
the fa cup final at the new wembley 2007 man united .
a lot of people thought this would be my last game at chelsea .
it was a great battle then didier scored in et .
the final whistle blew everybody went mad – apart from two calm individuals.. ''
i ran into the dressing room to call my wife .
one player avoided the immediate celebrations and followed me down the tunnel .
the game was over but in his mind as he left the pitch was only one thing to hug me as soon as possible .
or was he thinking that this embrace could be the last ... ?
he found me we hugged and we cried . ''
i could say player of course but above all his impact on the world at the moment is as a person as an african as an emperor of the ivory coast as a father as a son and as a friend .
it 's a privilege to have him in my life . ''
months after the cup final i was out of chelsea .
as on the first day there came that same embrace .
i could n't speak and didier could only say ‘this is not possible this is not possible this is not happening . '
i could only find the strength to turn and walk away . ''
didier is in my life as one of the best players i have managed in my career .
but much more importantly he 's in my life as one of the best and most unforgettable friends . ''
together the two of us side by side fighting for the same thing ?
or old with didier in retirement and me coaching in a wheelchair ?
i 'm wondering how parents handle rude remarks about their children being in a bookstore restaurant and other public places .
i personally try to keep calm about this kind of stuff some people do not like to see children and often have the mentality that parents need to keep their children out of all shops unless it is child related .
i recently took my three children to a bookstore with my husband ages 4 3 and 4 months old .
now i have normal active children but with that being said they understand how to behave in the library and i tell them this is no different .
with the help of my husband we do not have the same issues we would have if i were to have taken them alone .
my husband had bought us a coffee and taken the older two to buy a book when i saw a friend who i started to chat with .
when a older woman remarked that we should n't have brought a baby here .
she moved seats and put in headphones i thought the discussion was over .
i continued to talk with my friend while my baby slept he had not made a peep the entire time we had been talking .
my other children came to show me the book my husband was buying them .
they were incredibly excited and i did have to remind them to speak slowly and quietly immediately they stopped and told me again quieter this time .
the woman who had moved away came back and said she could not believe we had brought such unruly children to a bookstore .
i was not sure what to how should i respond in the future ?
if they had been screaming and carrying on we would have left immediately .
we would speak to them outside away from everyone to not cause a scene but they did not behave that way .
they were excited and wanted to show off a new book .
how are we to teach our children to behave properly if we are expected to stay at home until they can do it on their own ?
no child i know is born with a perfect understanding of when to cry or when to have a fit .
i do n't want to punish them by keeping them out of places like this but it seems to be expected by some .
only recently got into rda 's got the bonza which i love but have come across something weird last couple of days .
one pair of batteries sony vct5a 's show the ohm rating of my coils to be 0.16 the others samsung 25r 's show it to be 0.41 .
the 25r set are older probably about 3-4 months old and have been rewrapped with odb wraps appear perfectly done .
does this mean the samsung 's probably need binning ?
snoke might be still alive he just got his legs cut off .
he could of pulled a darth maul and lived while kylo ren and rey had no idea .
i mean darth maul had his legs cut off what 2-3 times ?
i think that snoke could do it at least once .
i think snoke will make a sudden appearance in ix and kylo will do a wha i killed you '' etc ...
when we purchase pc 's we also purchase office products with them like home and business or professional .
we have a few volume licenses when appropriate but not that many .
so when i install the software and activate it i associate with a generic email account i setup for the company .
the other day i ran into a limit and saw that i already had 30 activation 's on my account and now when i try to activate i cant .
this is a dbag business practice imo because this gives me control over the installations and allows me to reinstall them later through one central portal although looking them up sucks .
we weighed the pricing of 365 in our business and it was n't feasible .
has anyone found a workaround for this or will i need to create a second microsoft account just to get these installed from now on ?
i am having a problem with a leica 1850 cm which i am using to prepare sections for my masters degree .

sorry to be a pain as i 've posted a good bit in the last couple of days .
i just got my wisdom teeth out a few days ago nearly up to 72hrs since the operation and while i was swallowing some yogurt i felt something in my gum shift or change near one of the extracted tooth sockets .
that area is now occasionally sensitive to temperature and seems to be a little bit more painful than the other 3 sockets .
there was no bleeding have rinsed with salt water twice since it happened with no blood at all and from my limited ability to tell it seems like the sutures are still in place .
i 'm hoping it was just something to do with the swelling beginning to go down if it even is or whatever but i 'm kind of worried i 've dislodged something or something has happened .
there is currently little to no pain there 's a bit but it 's in both sides and some swelling on my cheeks/neck .
if anyone can help or give advice i would appreciate it .
any time you google anything about wisdom teeth extraction issues you get 50 articles about dry sockets so i 'm not doing that anymore and i will call my surgeon in the morning if it gets worse .
its probably worth noting i did hear a squeak of sorts in that region yesterday too while swallowing mashed potatoes .

so i have been oon suboxone for almost 5 years now .
i am at 16mg and it works perfectly fine ... .i split dose 8mg in the morning and 8mg before bedtime .
anyways my doc on the last couple appointments said i should start to only take my subs when i start to feel crappy like least amount possible and get cravings .
well the whole reason i am taking suboxone is so i do n't get cravings so why would i not take it and get cravings ?
i am a chronic relapser and i do n't have a good track record with staying clean except for this run where i have around 5 years from opiates .
i used to be on methadone and that just makes my mood borderline psychotic and i feel too high all the time .
i would hate to have to find another doctor because i do n't want to pay all those induction fees again .
i figure i am on this drug for the long term and have no plans to come off of it anytime soon because its like my insurance policy to stay clean .
everytime i have thought about getting high all i have to remember is that i am on suboxone and it would be a total waste of time and money to get high .
i am totally contempt with being on this drug forever as long as it keeps me clean and a functional and working member of the society i live in !
i know we ca n't go doctor shopping here so i wont ask for bay area doctors who put people on long term doses of suboxone .
guess that will be a whole day dedicated to the phone book and suboxonedotcom .
this is my first reddit post so i do n't know a thing about formatting what to post where etc .
i also do n't know if this would be considered as spam or an otherwise unwanted topic so feel free to let me know if i should delete this .
so valentine 's day is in a month and my girlfriend is a huge nnk fan .
i was thinking about getting her the wizard 's companion you get for buying the wizard ' edition knowing how hard it is to get one .
now i must admit that i underestimated the task .
after browsing the internet for a while i realized that the only way to order one is either getting the whole edition only found unopened for 600 or getting scammed .
which is why my only chance is asking for help here .
it sounds like a rude request i know but is there a possibility that anyone of you or your friends has one on their shelf not really using it anymore or in need to trade it in for cash maybe to preorder the king 's edition of nnk2 ?
knowing how commited the fanbase is i can imagine that many of you do n't want to part with it so every advice or link maybe you have seen an offer i have overlooked would help .
i do n't get nightmares often but i usually have pretty vivid dreams and i can usually remember a few of my dreams each night .
i was dreaming that i was still in college looking through a syllabus and assignment sheet when weird things started happening in my room .
this room i felt was mine although it was n't a room i recognized at all .
my blankets and sheets were being tugged away from me and i could n't open the door to get out .
the sheets were then being forced on to me like someone was trying to suffocate me but no one was there .
i was calling for help and i could hear people outside of the door almost like a dorm room door but it was my mom and dad who opened the door and got me out .
then i was in my childhood home trying to explain to them what happened and they did n't believe me .
i told them there was a force tied to me that wo n't leave me alone and i can prove it .
so i was looking at my reflection in the glass of an entertainment center when this demon-being think the darth maul-esque demon from insidious rises out of my chest for me to see .
my parents ca n't see it so i draw it for them .
then they are going to leave the house and as they 're leaving i noticed a baby monitor with a camera pointing in my room and the sheets pillows and other bedding are being thrashed around by no one .
i run outside and show this to my parents and they believe me .
then we google what we should do i get on a weird website to contact a friend and some guy says he 'll take my demon .
so then i feel that the demon has left but then i get a vision of a grey 4 headed dog alone in the woods all sad and stuff .
and i laid there completely frozen at 5 am .
also why i 'm still awake and all the lights are on in my house .
can anyone tell me more about the transaction speed of loopring ?
bitcoin was created as a tool for leaving the existing monetary system controlled by world governments .
what bothers me is that newcomers only see it as a speculative investment and have n't been sufficiently educated in why you want to control your own wealth in a decentralized censorship resistant way .
the constant focus on price dilutes the essence of bitcoin to the point where even hodlers might question what it 's really for besides growing their portfolio in value .
to get people to adopt bitcoin rather than just speculate they need to understand why it is a better system than keeping their wealth in a bank where an arbitrary government can decide how it 's spent and where it 's sent .
real bitcoin adoption would imply people buying it for its core value proposition and therefore not caring about the price .
if as many of us as possible actually move into bitcoin and leave fiat we can transact with each other and its usefulness as a global monetary system increases .
we should start educating people about this instead of encouraging them to buy as a means of getting roi .
with governments increasingly interfering with bitcoin and attempting to tax it i think this transition to adoption slowly happens by itself .
some of those who entered bitcoin for the sake of speculation realize they do n't want to cash out and be taxed which might help develop the bitcoin economy further .
accepting lightning payments for merchants should be a given for example .
tldr bitcoin is a tool for liberating humanity from governments .
if you care about your freedom adopt it as a way to liberate yourself from the system and not as a way to earn roi on government issued fiat .
i know this is probably very old news to most sfv fans but nuckledu posted this https twitter.com/liquidnuckledu/status/950835049959653376 where he said his contract with tl had expired and he was looking for options .
this is old but if he 's deciding to leave tl then it will be pretty sad as i really liked his guile in ultra sfiv .

good read ... one more thing to be added is the nostalgic attitude of kolkatans they want to regale in the past and seldom want to think forward .
also there is too much intellectualism there which is good to an extent but top much of it hampers growth and forward thinking .

if i 'm a local corner shop running everything including my payroll above board but 7-11 around the corner not only has the multinational corporate advantage in marketing but the franchise owner is employing illegal labor under the table then my idea of ‘logical reform ' is going to be all about ice raiding 7/11 and getting that franchise owner and anyone else who 's enabled this scam fined and/or driven out of business .

the other meme campaign i 'm running right now is pretty sick too but i just let em have fun with it since it 's just a game and we 're here to have fun .
at one point i made the mistake of mentioning that these frost goblin 's were weak to fire so they put a staff up his ass it 's always a good day as a dm when you have to say ok i guess i 'm rolling constitution for sphincter integrity '' and then together as a team roasted him over a fire like a marshmallow .

honestly i think the wait is gon na be worth it .
each update they bring out they have been huge .
i have a feeling based on previous updates this will be just as huge if not even more huge .
however i do agree they need to start being more talkative to us .
i could understand them not being as talkative when the game got a ton of backlash because sony made them stay quiet most likely but it 's been awhile since .
there 's no reason why they should be leaving us in the dark like this .

then take the east coast greenway alt trail untill norfolk .
ride until you reach falls cape landing state park and ride the boardwalks through the park untill you reach north carolina .
bike along the outer banks untill you reach the nc 2 bike trail and ride that until you reach the east coast greenway main trail by raleigh .

unfortunately not every bullied kid will have the advantage of being bigger than everyone else in the playground so it 's not really a solution to everyone .

oh wow actually getting replies from a 5-month-old post .
you make good points and i can certainly see the argument being made for how it 's all a matter of perspective .
being both fully optimized and just playing for fun are both just as valid approaches to me .
that said i do think on both counts the player should have the flexibility to see the merits of the other or at the very least not be an ass towards the other for not following their chosen mantra .

he 's alright not exactly op but is n't that bad .
his base atk stat is a smidge lower than other attackers for some reason .
his tri-attack becomes 600 mod which is nothing special and snowpetal becomes 857 mod if enhanced which is pretty decent for a non unlock finishing move .
he also gets a 55 fullbreak and an aoe 3-5 lb fill you can access anytime which give him pretty good utility .
his lb unlocks several moves that includes a 780 light chaining move can chain with orlandu family and an aoe 60 imperil move .
he also has a boatload of killers if you equip different weapons making him a kinda 7 firion .
his cooldown is just a silly reference to his battle at the bridge .
all in all he 's just a decent unit to have .
if you have better units like hyou for chaining or lasswell for finishing you might not have to bother with him .
personally i would use it to sequence specific markers so that i could create a super deadly flu virus ... but that 's just me .

the tories are playing with a very serious misconception that people necessarily become conservative as they get older .
that 's not actually true it 's just the case that for as long as anyone in western democracy can remember governments have made living conditions for older people very very sweet and easy so of course they 've historically voted for those governments .
conservatism is the result of having wealth and privilege to protect .
even when they 're 60 people who are now in their 20s will have no reason to vote conservative because they have never been offered anything but pain and poverty by the tories .
there is no rational reason to believe that those people will become conservative when they have so little worth protecting .

it is still obscenely powerful in standard even with the removal suite available .
it immediately puts you on the removal test and if you fail you are going to lose .
copter was played in 70 or so of the deck not because of a lack of removal but because it was way to damn strong .
it just slots into every creature based deck way too easily including energy which is likely the best copter deck anyway to be blunt makes said creature based decks better and if you are a creature based deck you are flat out wrong for not playing it .
the problem with standard right now is not that creature based decks are suffering and need a boost .
the grind to get most chars to lv 40 was something i set myself up to do which is why i am very willing to say that for a lot of people this would not be an issue .

yeah and if we take into account the current problems the starks have with continuity in ruling the north are we to believe that for the past x hundred years there was a consistent stark rule in the north ?
basically most great houses face existential threats over the course of the series lannisters starks arryns .
are we to believe that these houses ruled their respective regions for hundreds of years but all of a sudden all face extinction ?
so you 're telling me there is no correlation between this and the exact coinbase downtime ?

sometimes i 'll forget i 'm not running bt or the bt went off with someone else and i did n't notice whie running or worse of all i go in for the save but the killer grabs me off the hook .
point is some of those insta-saves may be bt mistakes and not an attempt to just farm you .
elsa would sing let it grow let it grow ! !
he 's fighting this weekend if i 'm not wrong .
unfortunately after that he may have to enlist for korean military service which lasts for about 2 years i think .
you are n't the president so nobody cares what you say .
the 8th gen chips are better value the cheaper i5 8600k is 20 more powerful clock-for-clock than the 7700k .
contrary to popular belief multi-tasking '' is not necessarily better on ryzen compared to intel and most home/office tasks are predominantly single-threaded and fare better on the intel chips
both chips will likely serve you well however you may need to overclock the 1700 and get fast ram like samsung b die for best performance particularly in gaming
this kid has the face of a kid who 's too strong for his own good .
whenever my boyfriend is going through hard times the distance is just so much worse because i ca n't be there for him to hold him .
a few things i 've tried but have n't actually done
ordering him food for delivery on grubhub this obviously only works for people in certain countries or in the same country idk how online food delivery works in other countries .
i did n't end up going through with this because the last time i almost did this the next text i received was that he was grabbing dinner ...
offering to do something to distract him from this troubles ie playing a game online with him watching online tv together even just calling him and talking about anything else .
i do not blame you for being upset about him i am criticizing the constant petty stream of arguments that absolutely never ends .
there are legitimate complaints to make and then there is just childish whining .
trump accepted a phone call from a democratic nation we give billions of dollars in military aid to every year !
we 're upsetting the authoritarian dictatorship and territorial rival that gives us our iphones !
also talking about him as if he 's a russian spy and simultaneously criticizing his bombing of assad 's airfield requires some pretty serious cognitive dissonance .
why not get the commercial done then go do survey/jumpers to r-atp mins ?
i alway see people say me3 ruined them but me2 turned them for a potentially rogue alliance black ops group into a privately led organization that had so much cash they could build a bigger and better version of an experimental spaceship in about two years successfully complete a project to revive a dead soldier better faster stronger than they were before and generally be the sole source of main support for the protagonist .
the game pretty much resorts to bs in order to keep cerberus as the sole source of main support for the protagonist .
like to paraphase shamus young 's retrospective shepard gets stuck in a loop of being unable to leave cerberus for the alliance because the alliance does n't trust them due to being in cerberus which they may want to leave for the alliance if we 're talking a lot of returning me1 players .
then you add in stuff like retconning the ending of me1 just to really make sure cerberus is considered the only remaining option .
the plot itself is really focused on the suicide mission and has everybody talking about it throughout the course of the game .
unfortunately the game forgets to generally explain what you are planning a suicide mission for .
it may not strictly matter due to what ends up being the actual impetus for it my crew 's been kidnapped and we got ta get them back !
but we 're still left with absurd moments like the realization that they were perfectly expecting to find out information about the collector homeworld as part of their suicide mission preparation from raiding the collector ship without really mentioning what the hell they expect shepard to do when they get there .
heck it does n't even bother to explain points like where the hell did mordin get that collector freeze bug if the collectors are very good at leaving no traces of themselves at the colonies they 've been kidnapping people from ? ''
like that last issue in particular is like a microcosm of the main issue underlying all these points me1 was a game where the plot generally came off from the details you were given and how they were interacted each other especially as you learned more details from the planets you visited .
me2 is a game that is reliant on the drama from a specific event it 's hyping up and generally does n't care about actually setting up the details behind the scenes instead relying on your immersion being completely unbroken throughout the way .
i wo n't lie and say it did n't work heck it would n't generally be the most popular me game if it did n't but in terms of what it contributes to the series as a whole ?
it 's just a gigantic mess that in hindsight was a glaring signal flare for what would become the me3 ending clusterfuck .
well i 've seen it done on many youtube videos ...
in any case it 's more likely they 'll search your wallet than go through your car 's instruction manual lol .
you can hide other drugs in your wallet but only lsd is concealable enough to fit between the pages .

for tahm kench usually really good into engage support .
try not to spam q too much your w costs quite alot of mana .
your ult is a really good picking or diving tool try using it with your jungler .
you are not a tank support try staying close to your adc/mid to devour them asap .
for taric your passive works with every spell so you can reset your q with anything it will save you quite some mana .
puting more than 2-3 points without having sizeable mana pool is a waste .
his auto and e damage are really strong in early game keep that in mind .
before a fight starts put your w on a backline diver to ult or e to help him kill their backline .
looks like someone hit you with a hot shovel and pumped you full of estrogen
in response to the remarks about the timeline in tlj pablo hidalgo suggested that ach-to was a place where time moved slower like dagobah .
i 'm sorta drawing the conclusion from that that even though the period from episode v and vi was only a year at least according to legends luke 's training actually lasted longer than that .
devils advocate could you not still do that and just keep a version with certain perks and just apply different mods to a new blank gun ?
you 'd essentially just be making your own random rolled '' guns instead it dropping already applied .
i was operating this idea under the idea that it may be really difficult to change how guns drop and this could be a work around in-game for people to kinda get what they want out of weapon rolls .
the answer is always try a different marketing angle .
the answer never is your product everybody is depraved just does n't cut it any more .
i know it 's fashionable to criticize mourinho on here but it 's not the play style .
10 is critical in his system and is a position where many players have excelled .
mourinho has also given him plenty of chances to rediscover form so he 's not being frozen out unfairly either .
well a set is a misnomer i picked up the tmnt one since it was a complete '' package to get into .

but palestine is 2 million people out of 2.18 billion muslims .
what do you expect a people who lost a war for their homeland to do ?
even if you ca n't display more than 60 frames it 's still better to run the game at more fps .
the game will render more frames for one refresh cycle and last and newest one is shown in the next refresh cycle .
so it 'll be newer '' than a frame which needs a full refresh cycle to render .
you wo n't see more frames but you 'll see newer or more up-to-date frames .
more fps always means less input lag regardless of the refresh rate of the monitor .
ecc is a great coin where do you see it in 1-2 months .
oh well not that i was counting on it .
otherwise i would rather keep the option of going up to 64gb in the future .
today i do need 16gb mainly for when i run virtual machines .
if that money can be put to a better use i will drop it .

on the face of it it would seem they are calling for him to say something along the lines of well he said it but he should have used different language .
he tries to claim he did n't say it .
oh because the economy has so drastically changed in 4 months .
until now it is the only footage taken . ''
i can see what you 're trying to say but although it is poorly worded it is still understandable .
i kept saying i would reevaluate when it got over 30x .
i did n't expect that to come half a month into the year .
you know how many bs calls your two stars get right ?

we were sold out for a dollar of fatcat profit .
my brother and i would rewind that scene over and over and laugh ourselves silly .
there 's an important caveat to this post that you do n't bring up this is only true if you never played before today .
even if you 're only tier 8 right now you could still hit tier 70 by buying the battle pass and leveling to 100 doing all the remaining daily challenges .
anyone at or above tier 8 can still get the black knight by doing dailies and leveling .
have yet to venture back to playgrounds this season .
inbounds had been too sick to warrant the hike .

even after clicking it i was still sure that was a caterpillar .
interesting at what time you evolved and also which biome did u evolve ?
so do i with fava beans and a nice chianti .
it truly does n't matter if there 's evidence or not .
impeachment hearings are done by congress and they have to have enough votes in both houses to essentially vote him out .
if evidence existed they could persuade members of congress to vote him out because then it 'd be apparent that he broke the law and it was n't a partisan witch hunt .
this is more about casting a shadow on his presidency and delaying his agenda than anything else .
because if he was impeached pence will be president and the republicans would still own both the legislative branch and the executive branch .
it 's a lot easier to be more casual about it in person
reminds me of the imposter '' a documentary that i believe is currently still on netflix .

michael scott is just such a fucking cringy boss and does such awkward shit
dwight is an intelligent '' idiot who knows what he 's doing while knowing nothing simultaneously
not much else to say other than he just plays people on their stupidity in the most nonchalant ways possible
their acting is all so authentic it feels so immensely real like this place exists somewhere on earth .
it 's a wonderful show and i do not recommend skipping season 1 .
i 'm sure s2 is much better as people say but there are plenty of laughs to be had with the first season .
it took me coming down with a cold to finally watch it .
today 's being like a weirdly emotional angsty day but i talked to some friends i have n't spoken to in a while so that was good

i didnt fully understand how team attacks worked so the experience gets equivalently divided ? i might give a good use to that thanks for all your help guys
the similarity in the verbiage they all use is explained by unimaginative ones ie most just using the provided role-play examples in their garbage troll scouting manual ...
i wo n't hold the democrats responsible if the government shuts down .
i will hold them responsible if they cave to the republicans because that will mean that there is literally no hope of getting anything done this year until after the midterms and if they blow this they might not get the outcome they are currently expecting .
because he likely invested in it/got as gift years ago and may not have funds now due to life/job changes .
i know that personally since the wii u came out i had my second kid and my wife became a stay at home mom so financially speaking it 's a lot harder for us and we need to wait to save and get non-essentials like switches and games .

i do n't see any major flaws or tells .
you can always take the two photos and put them over each other and make the gen more opaque so you can see if anything is off .
i would just check that the 9 and 6 indicators are level and you good to green-light .
if you find something that is going to bother you always check to see if it 's a know flaw with the factory or just a error with that one watch .
some people will reject a few before green lighting .
also once you see this with the naked eye it will look much sharper .
ideally i want to mount them higher on the wall to separate them more from the front floor speakers .

i have an ma in history never got around to my phd so there are a lot of people much more qualified to talk about stuff and vastly more knowledgable .
it seems to me that we 're mirroring the shifts of the early 1900s in these recent decades .
we had a progressive president obama mirrored by the progressives of teddy roosevelt and wilson .
now we have a return to normalcy '' conservative president trump and there is a large upsurge in nativist '' and racist sentiment in america alt-right etc ... mirrored by the presidencies of harding coolidge and hoover and the rise of the ku klux klan .
it 's odd how these things are mirrored by each other but if we continue down this road ... we all know what happened in 1929 due to the big business focus of harding coolidge and hoover .
right now we 're seeing massive growth in the stock market ...
i really like your theory and i hope your right .

nothing beats senheiser or audio technica in that price range .

i can sit here say how much confidence i have in the developer but that means nothing .
there have been questions about this being a revival of old tech but he thought that taking over an old project was easier than starting from scratch .
he later found out it was n't but he proceeded anyway to what it has become .
realize that most of the time he 's been working on it the price of coin was not good .
in fact he was so determined to make it a success that he left his job and started coding full time for ecc .
they now have a team of 8 or so coders who are very active on their slack .
for this or any other coin ... do you feel this project delivers something unique and can do it well and does the project have a strong dev team ?
do you feel like you 've exhausted your fomo feelings and now are thinking logically ?
if the answer is yes buy in sooner than later .
if not wait until you 've made more assessments .
that said while i think this project is interesting and worth pursuing to see where it goes i have no illusions that it 'll revolutionize it or give me a lambo next week .
what i spent on this coin so far is money i can afford to lose .

this is how people justify their hate-filled ideas while ignoring that it leads to this type of violence e.g .

that said we do n't really know why he did this yet so the idea that he was targeting her because of the hijab could even be wrong even though it seems more likely that he was .

for a game like this you need a fairly strong cpu if you want no stuttering or frame drops right now .
i 'm running an i5 4440 and i had a r9 270 previously which did technically run the game at 75 fps but occasional drops below 60 and the card running at 90 degrees all the time meant i needed a lil bit of an upgrade .
now i 'm chillin on 101 fps 90 of the time and sitting on around 70 with constant micro stutters when looking at the stupid new christmas tree in retail row .
i guess i set the bar too low when i said better than console though the bare minimum to be competitive imo is to never drop below 60 fps and keep stuttering to a point where it 's unnoticeable which i feel is fairly reasonable to shoot for .
you 'll get people who talk about 144hz monitors and whatnot but that 's a whole level above reasonable for realistically a v small advantage .
i 'd say something like a 1060 or a 1070 a core i5 8400 is a strong build that 'll easily hold 100 fps with the 1060 and 120 with the 1070 never dropping below those and probably almost never stuttering .
considering a build like that would still be less than 1000 usd with bare minimum ram hdd case etc it does n't make a shit ton of sense to spend 200-300 bucks less and have your cpu struggle to keep up with your graphics card which really is a problem in br games especially when view distance is on epic although it 's worth noting minimum view distance actually is n't a competitive disadvantage except when trying to see buildings from very far away .
that 's horrible.. especially when i would expect that you have plenty of patients that could stand to lose some weight

i am 20 weeks pregnant and i am dying for a prenatal massage .
the thing is since i got pregnant my skin has been awful .
i am pretty much always breaking out on my back .
i keep as clean as i can and apply acne wash as much as possible but i think it 's just the hormones .
which unfortunately means that it probably wo n't clear up until after i give birth in june .
does this make me ineligible for a back massage ?
right now i do n't have any spots that are super painful or really gross white heads or anything .
but i want to be considerate to the masseuse .
ive been over my ex for a while now doesnt make sad anymore but whenever i go out drinking i always think of her .
it happened at new years but i thought it was just random but it happened again last night .
i was dancing with a girl and it just hit me all the memories came rushing back into my head and i found myself wishing i was with her again .
i had to take some air to calm myself down as i was on the verge of crying .
luckily i did not drunk text her cause it took me all my strength not to .
are these just stupid drunk thoughts or am i still not over her .
whenever i drink i think a lot about my ex and gets me really sad .
in that moment i wish i could talk to her .
i though i was over her are these just stupid drunk thoughts ?

the house was empty unusual for a saturday night and she was looking forward to a night of peace and quiet .
the sudden ring of the doorbell caused her to glance up at the clock .
with a small sigh she put the book aside and left poor rachel alone for the first time with her secret love her father 's stableboy .
a quick glance out the peephole identified the caller and she quickly undid the deadbolts on the door and opened it wide .
standing before her was a teenage boy drenched by the rain .
good evening mrs.d '' i said as i dripped onto the foyer carpet .
michael what are you doing out in weather like this you 'll catch cold or even worse in this downpour . ''
i just wanted to drop off becky 's report for school '' i said as i produced a small binder wrapped in plastic from under my soaked jacket .
i promised her i 'd proof read it and get it back to her by tonight . ''
mrs.d said with skepticism are you sure you did n't just write it for her . ''
the guilty look on my face told her i had .
well we 'll discuss this later '' she said as she tossed the report on a nearby table .

good morning everyone i am currently doing a research project for my university and have chosen the theme of harry potter .
the topic which i have chosen is having the project revolve around a brand new idea of having a harry potter themed hotel here in proximity to the universal area to correspond with the theme park .
the idea is that this will be a property of universal a signature hotel/resort for the park .
if this new hotel came to fruition what is something that you would love to see with it ?
please elaborate if you would like the more information the better !
these are just a small small portion of what i am curious about .
i know i never had this issue until i got on sub !
i 'm looking to get some customization done to my car and i have all of the parts but none of the expertise to install them .
i looked on yelp but the truth is i 'm just not sure exactly what sort of shop i 'm looking for and even if i did know what to search i 'm not sure i trust yelp 's rankings anyways .
i 'm looking for a good all around shop to do things that range from cat-back exhaust and down/mid-pipe installations to light body work such as headlight/sidemarker installation and swapping my car 's black front grille for a carbon fiber piece .
i 'm not sure if such a place or person exists but if so i 'm looking for one that is a good bang for my buck .
obviously it wo n't be dirt cheap and have the best service so i 'm looking for something middle of the road .
if it means anything my car is a 2017 honda civic type r i 've found plenty of shops that do ford 's and other american brands as well as shops that work on gtr 's but nothing exactly suited to my needs yet .
if you have anything for me to even look into please do n't hesitate to let me know .
perhaps you recognize my username from all the game threads pre-december 20th or so .
i have not stopped watching just switched from an android to an iphone had an unlocked galaxy s7 — loved it but att does n't allow wifi calling in unlocked phones and so i had to drive two blocks from my house in the fucking middle of houston to make or receive calls and did n't even get voicemails when in my house .
now i do n't have the handy swish app and it 's much tougher for me to comment in game threads while watching the game .
so i just wanted to explain my absence from r/rockets and r/nba since i 'm not there to spit knowledge at our haters and back up the homies whose names i 'll tag momentarily u/thatbrasiliankid u/jameshardenwasrobbed u/dj_verism u/briand2714 u/bigswole92 and everyone else i randomly catch in the threads both with upvotes and commentary .
so on a side note what do my fellow iphone users use to comment in the threads if you 're watching the game through a stream ?
i have a friend that joined davorcoin through my referral link and he made a large loan yesterday but i still have n't received the commission what 's up with that ?
so i 've been doing alot of research this week reading all of arthur 's blog posts watching his seminars and reading up on how to engage in these arbitrage opportunities and i am still left with a few unanswered questions .
so like 99 of the information i saw was specifically regarding bitcoin products .
how well does this strategy work with altcoins though ?
i thought maybe the mechanics of the altcoin futures are different enough to make it not as profitable although they usually have a huge positive basis .
also in the event that the price rises considerably you are losing tons of bitcoin but still retaining the same amount of usd .
if you have 10 btc and 10 xbt worth of contracts and the price doubles you lose half your xbt so your 20 total btc is now only 15 .
you end up with more usd just based on the premium of the contracts but over time you are just witting away your btc holdings by shorting a longterm bull market .
so is there no way to set up the hedge so that no matter which way the price moves you lose very little btc ?
seems like to me in order to accomplish that you would need to short the future and long the swaps but then you may end up losing money due to funding .
anyway if anyone could help me out or link me to any helpful documentation or resources i would greatly appreciate it .
i need to have a bathroom near me 24/7 which is obviously complicating my life in every sense .

i went to a harvest festival in october and there was a surprising amount of both and things .
an overall staggering amount of exotic animals including multiple zooboomafi or ring-tailed lemurs a large corn maze a popcorn booth the size of a small cabin and a pumpkin slingshot .
my friends and i did n't wan na pay for slingshotting so we skipped past it throughout the day but before we left for good i wanted to try to do at least a moderate amount of shenanigans .
i went to the woman running the miniature pumpkin slingshot stand and asked her if i could take already flung pumpkins .
obviously disinterested and tired she did n't much care as long as she did n't get fired .
i dashed out to the field of smashed gourds and got to work scanning through multiple days of flung flesh to find ones still fresh and uncracked .
30 seconds in the slingshot woman realized what she had done and her look of apathy turned to one of horror .
i filled my camera bag with pumpkins got as many as i could in my arms and hands it must have been two dozen at that point .
still my thirst for free stuff still unsatisfied i decided to sacrifice my clothing .
i stretched my shirt to create a pocket and this pouch fit so many more .
the lady hid her face in embarrassment my friends pleaded for the madness to end with exponential intensity .
i stopped partially out of my own volition and partially because my ride was threatening to ditch me .
ecstatic delighted and cackling i retreated back behind the fence and offered my treasured goods to my reluctant cohorts and they gratefully obliged .
my friends and i we still have many of these pumpkins in our houses .
intact and nigh pristine they serve as reminders of how fervent desire asking the right questions and not caring about how stupid you look can lead to success .
i might not have a conscience but i sure as hell have some pumpkins .
i 'm researching different property systems trying to understand how property might look in future stateless societies and trying to understand how occupancy-and-use norms of the sort advocated by benjamin tucker might look if implemented in the real world .
i 'm interested in theoretical work but i 'm mainly hoping to find empirical examples to study .
i 've already read the land section of instead of a book the sections of kevin carson 's studies in mutualist political economy that discuss primitive accumulation '' and tucker 's four monopolies and proudhon 's what is property ?
i 've also read anderson and hill 's book the not so wild wild west which explains their theory of property norms and discusses empirical examples and a spattering of other essays both theoretical and empirical .
i guess more specifically i 'm looking for schelling points '' as david d. friedman http www.daviddfriedman.com/academic/property/property.html anderson hill https mises.org/library/not-so-wild-wild-west and others term them that occupancy-and-use advocates can use or point to to help sell their ideas .
non-proviso lockean norms are theoretically simpler one owns property including land until one gives it away or dies and upon death it either goes to a specified heir or in the absence of a will becomes unowned and homestead-able .
some anarcho-capitalists argue that their system also has abandonment and that the occupancy-and-use norms of mutualists are just the same as ancap property norms with different lengths of time specified for abandonment but 1 other ancaps well one other ancap have told me they thought the only non-arbitrary norm was that one owned property until one 's death so i 'm thinking the idea of abandonment may actually be a departure from a pure ancap position and 2 proudhon tucker carson and shawn wilbur are all over the place in their descriptions of what occupancy-and-use entails .
carson to a somewhat lesser extent i guess he seems to agree more or less with the lockean-with-different-abandonment-periods idea but ...
it 's hard to sort out all the different ideas .
i 'm attempting to write an article persuading anarcho-capitalists to adopt softer positions on property property in land in particular .
i 'm drawing a lot on benjamin tucker and kevin carson in my ideas but i do n't think i 've come up with a persuasive argument yet and i think the accusation of arbitrariness '' is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome .
losing one 's property upon death is i think something a lot of people will intuitively think of as less arbitrary '' than losing title after leaving something abandoned for a period of x years because of the open-endedness of the number of years or amount of time .
i 'm looking for other principles that people could perceive as non-arbitrary and that could enable communities to maintain and encourage distributed ownership of land in ways that i 'm not convinced pure rothbardian norms could .
so i just had a low mr player from my friends list ask me for 50 plat so they can buy some cosmetics from the market .
i would n't have minded if they wanted a frame or weapon slot but begging for fashion is a bit too much .
they kept begging and saying that they do n't have ways of making plat and i just told them some ways on how you can make plat early in the game and that it 's not cool to beg .
it 's after this that the player said that they would just report me to de so that my account will get banned .
they also mentioned that they have multiple accounts and would use those to report me as well .
i put a lot of hours into this account and it would be terrible to get it banned so i just wanted to know if there was any truth to this statement .
i am blown away from its noise ... or lack of it .
super happy with it and i finally have a pfsense box to toy with .
thanks r/homelab for your suggestions in my last post .
hi this seems to be the only starter culture available in new zealand i was wondering if anyone has any information on it .
a few buddies and i are looking to do the badger pass to glacier point 22m rt hike over the span of a few days next weekend and have a few questions .
if so is the hike currently doable without snowshoes ?
are the roads open up to park at badger pass and is the ranger station open at badger pass to get the wilderness permit ?
it means to not over do but to not not do anything .
to be awakened we must be at some level be asleep .
what does it feel like to be eyes wide opened but asleep ?
our every waking moment requires engagement clarity and most important of all to be present for it to be truly experienced .
to awake is to sharpen your senses to sharpen your state of consciousness to strip as much ignorance of reality as possible .
when you awaken you realize oh wait everything in moderation .
there is no need to chase to be awake there is no longing to be awake all the time because half of the fun is being asleep .
when you feel like your falling asleep sit breath and awake .

i 'm very new to the game only been playing for a week .
i was just wondering if it 's common to buy the season pass or is the season pass kinda frowned upon because of greediness from ubisoft .
also is it viable to just play the game as it is and still unlock fun operators ?
i have only unlocked one dlc operator and it took ages but it was mira and i 've really enjoyed her .
on a certain day ye zichen was dragged into a deities ' chat group .

should i finish affinity and go for boros or would another kind of deck be on a more even playing field against the other decks that i have ?
i want to have at least four decks i can play against each other with different playstyles that are fairly balanced and wo n't get completely wrecked by the other decks i own when i 'm playing outside of fnm .
a few days ago i purchased a supreme shoulder bag for 120 thinking it was authentic .
the pics did n't look too bad and the seller had a high rating with many items sold .
i got the bag today and after examining it with a closer look and comparing it with fakes off ebay i 've realized the bag is fake .
i 'm just not sure what to do right now whether if i should contact the seller or grailed or paypal .

after losing a good amount of my gains yesterday by freaking and trading like a moron moved to usdt then litecoin over to coinbase to hold as cash and missed the correction because it took an hour to get back to binance i 've decided to stop trying to be a day trader hodl and concentrate on my real job .

i want to invest in solid teams with good potential then forget about it until april .
i 'm pretty new to investing and i just read about the new options trading feature coming to robinhood .
i did some googling to try to figure out what it is and i ca n't grasp the concept .
not sure if the title makes sense but this is an idea i 've had for a while .
also spoilers for wind waker-it 's an old game yeah but still thought i 'd add that .
now as we all probably know first reactions to wind waker were extremely negative .
there were several cries of ruined forever '' due to the game 's cell-shaded artstyle to be fair the early trailers did n't help portraying the game like it was much more cartoony than the final game is .
this feeling among the fandom was primarly caused due to attachment to previous zelda games most notably to oot and their worlds .
the reason i 'm bringing this up is because one of wind waker 's most prominent themes is that of moving on from the past .
the game uses oot nostalgia like a lot of zelda games but in a very particular way .
the land of hyrule the same one the player explored and saved in previous games is the source of desire of ganondorf .
furthermore he is dismissive of the great sea in a similar way to an old time player who may desire to return to the hyrule field of old .
the game then uses nostalgia to give shape to the past '' the villain is clinging to .
the ending then where hyrule is buried under water would represent letting go of nostalgia to be able to experience new adventures .
finally another theme of ww 's plot is the passing of wisdom from the old to the young the king leaving the future in link and zelda 's hands for instance .
coincidentally but perhaps not so this is the first game to have aonuma as sole director and is more or less the point he became the go-to zelda guy at nintendo over miyamoto .
additionally he 's stated that he became a father around the time of the game 's development .
perhaps these occurrences influenced this particular theme of the game 's plot .
so to sum up i think it 's possible that ww 's story was influenced by the fandom 's reaction as well as events going on in aonuma 's life .

jennifer was a 23-year-old student at the local north shore community college in danvers massachusetts .
she worked part-time as a server in a nearby restaurant to help pay her rent for her small one-bedroom apartment .
with no roommate to help split the rent and no boyfriend to keep her company she decided that having a loving companion would rid her of that loneliness while at the same time give her a sense of security at night .
this loving companion was a 3 and a half-year-old australian shepard she named rango .
he was an amazing dog that was always by her side as much as possible .
when she got home from school he was there .
when she got home from work he was there .
when she went to bed and woke up in the morning he was laying there with her .
jennifer took care of rango as if he was her own child .
the way every dog owner should treat their pets .
the only problem with rango was that she would have to walk him by pulling him along instead him leading the way .
you know when dogs find something irresistible during a walk and they must stop and smell it no matter how many times you tug at their leash ?
this was how every walk went for jennifer and rango .
she made sure his collar was tight for this specific reason so he could n't pull out of it when she tugged on the leash .
it became such a habit that she stopped looking to see what he had found and continued walking forward tugging at his leash and she carried on .
most days when the timing was right she took rango for a long walk through a nice park close to her apartment .
usually the sun was still up during this time so she felt safe especially with her trusty companion by her side .
of course nothing ever works out perfectly and some days you 're forced to bend the rules and break out of your routine .
on a certain thursday afternoon jennifer was late getting out of class which caused her to get stuck in traffic making her drive home one of many little annoyances that come with every day .
afraid that she would be late to work she decided to take rango on a fast walk .
this meant going through a different unfamiliar area of the park they frequented .
the sun was already beginning to set on this late autumn evening as they began their walk and time was not on her side either .
instead of taking the nice scenic route they usually took she turned and went down a different path that she thought would be quicker .
it was pretty much dark at this point and as jennifer tugged at rango to hurry up with minutes left until she had to be back to leave for work she continued looking ahead while commanding to rango stop sniffing everything and hurry up ! that 's when she heard the jingle of his collar not behind her but running up beside her and sprinting down the path ahead .
as she watched him run down the path her heart sank because she could still feel a tug on the leash only stronger and with more resistance .
without turning around and with her breathing and heart rate increasing she could feel all tension on the leash finally let up .
her companion who never left her side was barely out of her sight by now but she could hear the dirt shuffle behind her .
rango waited at jennifer 's apartment door for hours that night .
if the day comes that i do drink again it will not be because i had no alternative .
it will be because i had an alternative provided by a loving god but was unwilling to use it . ''
about the beginning of the year 1646 as i was going into coventry a consideration arose in me how it was said that 'all christians are believers both protestants and papists ' and the lord opened to me that if all were believers then they were all born of god and passed from death to life and that none were true believers unless that had happened and though others said they were believers yet they were not .
at another time as i was walking in a field on a first-day morning the lord opened in me an understanding 'that being educated at oxford or cambridge was not enough to fit and qualify men to be ministers of christ ' and this stimulated my thinking about it because it was the common belief of people .
but i saw it clearly as the lord opened it to me and i was convinced of its truth .
i admired the goodness of the lord who had opened this understanding to me that morning .
this struck at priest stevens ' ministry namely 'that to be bred at oxford or cambridge was not enough to make a man fit to be a minister of christ . '
so what opened in me i saw struck at the priest 's ministry .
but my relatives were much troubled that i would not go with them to the church '' to hear the priest instead i went into the orchard or the fields with my bible by myself .
i asked them did not john say to believers 'that they needed no man to teach them but as the anointing teaches them . '
though they knew this scripture to be true they were still upset and fearful because i could not yield to their wishes in this matter and go to hear the priest with them .
i saw that a true believer was something different than what they believed one to be and i saw that being educated at oxford or cambridge did not qualify or fit a man to be a minister of christ .
knowing that why would i want to follow people from oxford or cambridge ?
so i could not join in with them or any of the dissenting groups but i was as a stranger to all and relied entirely upon the lord jesus christ
at another time it was opened in me 'that god who made the world did not dwell in temples made with hands . '
this at first seemed strange because both priests and people used to call their temples or churches dreadful places holy ground and the temples of god .
but the lord showed me clearly that he did not dwell in these temples which men had commanded and built but in people 's hearts .
both stephen and the apostle paul bore testimony that he did not dwell in temples made with hands not even in the one temple of jerusalem which he had once commanded to be built since he put an end to the typical dispensation but that his people were his temple and he dwelt in them .
this opened in me as i walked in the fields to my relation 's house . ''
i have tried the one and two button shut down alternating with the restart .
nothing gets hot and when charging the light on the dock or the cord will flash off for a moment .
if i put my eat up to the fans there is a very high pitched wine for a moment then nothing .
i do n't have amenorrhea but i have claft palate anosmia small breasts and as long as i know i 'm asexual since i do n't feel anything down there when watching sexy people but i do have libido though i do n't know if the level is normal .
it 's 7am and it 's been 2 bottles of wine and some rum .
she died and i never really gotten over it though i 've put half my life in between us .
i never really felt like committing to anyone anymore .

this story has a lot to do with politics .
i tried to write this in such a way as to be coy about who leans what way and what issues were being discussed but nothing made sense so i 'm just going to give up on that and be upfront about everything .
i 'm left wing whereas ex-friend leans more towards the right .
also we 're canadian so some of this info is going to be a little region specific .
jay '' and i used to be friends in high school however after graduating we drifted apart and became more casual acquaintances who occasionally hung out .
in that time i became pretty politically outspoken especially when i started university and met some like-minded friends .
jay on the other hand did n't seem all that interested in politics when we were in high school so i 'm honestly a little surprised he had any political opinions at all but he had apparently became fairly conservative over the years .
i try not to let this bother me your entitled to your opinion and all that but there was this one incident that really upset me .
jay and i had gone out for coffee and he had invited his girlfriend along i had known she was going to be there so this was n't a surprise we were sitting at a table near the counter and we overheard this man with a heavy arab accent order .
as soon as he was out of ear shot the girlfriend made a comment and those leeching refugees '' .
my parents originally came to the west as refugees so naturally i took offence .
this blew up into an argument i called her racist and she called me over sensitive .
jay was mostly silent occasionally pipped up to defend his girlfriend and i started tearing up and left .
jay later texted me an apology but also said that i hurt his girlfriend 's feelings .
i got the feeling that he wanted me to apologize .
instead i asked if he had the same views as her he said he saw the logic in her arguments .
i replied that i ca n't be friends with someone who believes that nonsense and stopped hanging out with him .
that was several months ago and up until a few days ago i had n't seen jay since .
my friends and i get every friday off so for us thursay night is our hangout at the bar and drink night .
i was out with them and i ran into jay there .
he seemed to be alone in hindsight i probably should n't have done this but i invited to hang out with my friends and i. i was tipsy by then and all i could think of was hey your fun to hang out with come join us '' so he did .
this group frequently discusses politics and this time the topic at hand was the stuff going on with tim hortons .
we were all bad mouthing timmies and swearing not to spend another cent there again when jay interrupted and said its not their fault they had to what they did because of the minimum wage increase .
we all thought that was hilarious because timmies is a giant corporation that can definitely afford to pay their employees without screwing them over .
we started really ripping into it mockingly asking how are they suppose to pay for their gold-leafed cars now .
i did n't notice him leaving but apperently jay slipped away after that .
this morning i got a text from jay asking how i could have stood by while my friends made fun of him .
i have n't replied but honestly i 'm pretty pissed off at the audacity of him .
he literally did the same thing to me a while back when his girlfriend was ribbing into me but when it happens to him suddenly its wrong ?
but a part of me does wonder if i was wrong .
should probably point out here that i took part in mocking jay myself so i 'm not innocent here and an eye for an eye does n't necessarily make things right .
at the same time before this we have n't spoken at all since the incident at the coffee shop and he did n't bother apologizing to me .
i 'm not sure wat to do do i owe jay anything ?
tl dr former friend is mad because while discussing politics with my friend group i took part in what i thought was harmless teasing but he 's apperently he 's really hurt .
long story short i have beef with one of my sister 's best friends and i do n't speak to her and she does n't speak to me .
i have tried fixing the problem because i do n't like holding grudges but to be honest i would be perfectly fine with never speaking to her again but i somehow forgot she comes 5x a week to our house .
when i tried squashing the beef she merely looked the other way and said is someone speaking ?
she has a tendency of saying who 's that .
that 's a nobody each time my siblings bring me up and they have the audacity to laugh at her joke .
this all started after i called her a racist for wrapping a scarf around her head saying she was going to bomb a school .
she told me i was nobody to be saying what racism is and after that incident it 's been a reoccurring joke of hers .
each time she comes to my house i just stay in my room and watch fear the walking dead which is fine because i 'm trying to finish the series and my free trial is almost up .
i stay in my room because i get very uncomfortable when i know someone does n't like .
each time i go into my room she laughs or smirks which i do n't really know if she 's mocking me or what her problem is .
i do n't like being confrontational so i just stay in my room .
i also feel like a pussy because i should n't be hiding in my house lol but everything she does annoys the hell out of me now so i rather stay in my room by myself rather than getting in an argument or feeling unwanted .
to make matters even worse she 's part of my posse and if i get into he conversation she just stays quiet and look the other way .
does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this annoying childish obstacle .
sorry for the photo but it was the easiest way to post this .
right now i only have 2 6a 6b and 6c on that list .
i realize 2 is stupid overkill running a 180 watt server with 96 gigs of ram 24/7 for a file server and backup plus plex .
6x is what currently runs my home internet plus my home wired internet connections .
i 'm not looking to virtualize freenas or the router .
what i was thinking though is possibly moving freenas to a lower power usage machine even though i do n't really care about the electric .
i just feel that right now the r710 is kinda being wasted .
something i would like to know in regard to why does plex sometimes say my server is too slow when it has a passmark score of 8149 ?
this only happens on some titles when transcoding in subtitles .
the movies are native blu ray but most at at 1080p resolution .
i thought the recommended passmark for a 1080p transcode was 2000 ?
if i did decide to move the os to another server would i be able to swap the discs out into another das unit like an sa120 ?
i was eventually going to get one as an expansion unit since my r710 is populated completely and it would be much cheaper just buying the sa120 and making another raid z2 dataset with 8tb or 10tb discs and extending it onto my current volume .
if i ca n't do that i could just use the sa120 as the main storage unit and use the empty 6 drive bays for something else .
i have never dabbled in virtualization so i do n't know much about it .
i was at first thinking just get like a older 2 bay poweredge server with low wattage cpu 's and put two 8tb purple drives in it and call it a day but putting everything on bare metal is kinda stupid .
i would like some suggestions on possibly a more powerful server to virtualize on .
i do have another r710 that is racked but i do n't use it .
bought it for a backup incase something died in my main unit .
maybe virtualizing the surveillance software though a windows vm would work along with maybe running a pie hole vm or something ?
i just want to start optimizing and expanding but doing it in an efficient manner .
oh and i was thinking about putting pf sense on an r210 ii ?
i 'd like to have the listing in compact style but each time iaunch an app i have it in full style display mode .

whenever somebody snaps at me or lectures me harshly or so much as look at me coldly or roll their eyes at me when i do something wrong my thoughts begin to get clouded in black and i end up thinking disturbing things a few minutes after my mind goes blank from the rants they give me .
i can see why i 'm the one at fault and i 'm deeply sorry for whatever i 've done but while most people are remorseful and down after apologizing i snap internally at least .
before in the case of my parents whenever they 're pissed at me for whatever reason especially my verbally abusive and previously physically abusive mom i 'd just look down and say sorry .
but when i grew up i started getting angrier and angrier at them over the years whenever i so much as get a lecture from them i 'd get horribly pissed or terribly annoyed whenever my dad gets mad at me or is just in a bad mood in general so i just quietly sulk and wish he 'd shut up for the entire in the corner and when it comes to my mom whenever we were n't having any shouting contests of any sort i 'd just give her the middle finger behind her back and turn up my headphones ' volume to the max so i do n't have to listen to her bs anymore for fear of snapping hard .
there was actually a time in 3rd grade when i wished that they both died by my hands even though i knew from the back of my mind that i did n't want that to happen .
this anger extended itself to teachers from grade school to college .
when a teacher told me off for echoing statements from my classmates when bad things happened that time not my thoughts or stance just something i was telling a friend because she was asking in front of underclassmen that time i kept quiet ... but was actually secretly wishing that i 'd push her into a deep pool and have her drown painfully and messily from there .
then when a tutor and i had a heated argument over an equation i accidentally snapped at her when she got mad at me and i had the urge to punch her in the face so hard that it would bleed and get smashed badly .
nothing of the sort happened of course so again i just kept those things to myself .
i did n't just want to hit them i wanted them to suffer a lot in life so i outperformed them academically .
too bad that that was n't enough for me since i still hated them up until now despite being mostly cordial to them or at least pretending to be friendly with them .
the urge to push them off high stairs was still there and i could n't help but feel happy whenever they felt miserable .
a superior of mine snapped at me for doing something wrong at work over messenger yesterday .
i was deeply sorry for it and even apologized but then she started ranting afterwards which transformed my depressed state into annoyance and eventually into seething dark anger .
but when i got home not only did i imagine wanting her to suffer too i began to vividly imagine what it would be like for me to beat her to death with my own hands while i shouted the grievances i had with her as my fists would pummel her face into a bloody pulp .
and those violent thoughts were n't just limited to her as while i was going home i began wishing horrible things would happen to the strangers around me because of my crappy mood .
not only that i stopped giving zero fucks over what could happen to me for the rest of the day .
those thoughts filled me with absolute mirth and i was horrified .
i 'm not gon na deny that i 'm still extremely mad at her and all those other people i mentioned up until now but despite cooling off since yesterday i still feel the need to violently lash out at her verbally or otherwise .
any advice on how i should deal with this issue ?
me getting mad at others for being mad at me ?
the only way that i 've been dealing with this recently is by holding this anger in but i 'm afraid that this pot would boil over one day and i 'd just snap into doing something i may regret later .
so when it comes to the way sell walls and buy walls work i 'm a bit confused ... so if the s are larger on one side that side is the winner ?
so if there is a larger quantity of trx buys on the buy wall ... .does that make the value increase ?
and if it was reversed it 'd be decreasing ?
so in the picture above ... that would make the value decrease because of the millions upon millions of trx sell walls ?

last week i bought each member of the court of archon from gw in the uk .
this seems the only way to get the minis .
i 'm really unhappy that they cost 38£ for 4 small figures and so far the first 2 i opened are a mess .
i started with the ur ghul feeds and giant pieces of resin all over i 've carefully cut it down to avoid losing much detail but hes missing the bones on the top of his spine the entire shoulder/back recess on one side and probably the worst thing both the big toes are separate from the rest of his feet like a massive split running up to the ankles i will have to saw him off the base slot and squash the feet together with glue/green stuff .
i can live with this as hes supposed to be an unnatural looking model .
i moved onto the lhamaean before even removing the resin feeds etc .
i can see her one half of her back armour looks like a dog has chewed it and is missing a large area her face has a piece of extra resin sticking out almost like a 2nd nose mistake so she is likely missing cheek part of the nose and eye socket detail .
has anyone had any positive experience with said minis or advice on what to do ?
am i just paying too much attention to detail ?
i 've got plenty of old metal minis including the archon lelith and drazhar but dont remember any issues with them like this .
thanks for the responses i 'm going to open the other 2 models and check if they are ok then email gamesworkshop with pictures .
the worst case if i get bad replacements as well perhaps i can make 1 good one from 2 parts .
welcome to fresh metal https www.reddit.com/r/metal/search ? q 5bfresh+metal 5d+author 3asomethingoverthere restrict_sr=on sort=new t=all where i talk a bit about releases that came out this week .

i had n't drank at all since my last post .
last night was only my second night back at my apartment and not staying with my parents and i drank .
i didnt drink to the point of blacking out but im still disappointed in myself because i did n't plan on drinking at all .
my friends dont really know how much im trying not to drink so they do n't really support it and we just ended up playing drinking games all night .
i 'm so confused about what i 'm what i 'm doing with my life and i just dropped out school for the second time the first time was a hardship withdrawal and i 'm unemployed .

neither do i haha so much less room to put it .
your arm is literally trying to hide your body !

i ca n't imagine anyone asking why is associating a black kid with the word monkey such a big deal '' to not be sheltered or willingly obtuse about it .
americans have actually put black kids in a monkey exhibit https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ota_benga and race realism '' that 's painted blacks as savages closer to primates .
monkey '' is not some ancient outdated pejorative that 's not in the lexicon of today .
it 's a common insult for a black person .
it 's just ridiculously stupid that me saying something like 'yeah that 's bad look for h m ' is considered too sensitive .
so many people are so repelled by political correctness '' and being called a snowflake that they 're actually trying to diminish the situation here and that 's a black kid is wearing a pretty common racist insult on a sweater .
it will be interesting to see how it plays out .

the dm in my opinion is 100 per cent allowed to metagame .
they should n't really make a habit of it because it could make the world feel fake but it is important that the dm is able to maintain some control over the world outside of just creating a simulation of a fantasy setting .

you captain the player you think will give you the most points .
but i do n't even know why hazard is among your choices when he 's been utter shite for fpl and his only goal in the last 6 fixtures was from a penalty .
on top of that it 's not even a good fixture .
yeah he might go and score 2 goals and get an assist and then you 'll come back and have a go at me but the only reasonable choice out of those two is kane .
make no mistake if you choose hazard for this week based off recent performances and the mediocre fixture you are a casual .
keep it up maybe one day you will get the notoriety you so desperately chase day after day .

the trick is ... do n't ask for some stupid ass assignment you 'll never get australia uk or whatever .
ask for what is open or what your assignment manager is trying to fill .
you may not get super rare assignments though i have had two that were rare '' but you at least get a say in the matter .
then i bust out. is the part that really brings it all together .
there 's no proof to show whether there was or was n't studio meddling but i think what we do see within the film is that it leans towards the idea that the script may have been changed after the fact seeing as that idea that was previously mentioned is briefly introduced but disregarded seemingly to make room for this other sequence .
and maybe i 'm not giving enough credit to the screenwriter and the people behind the story but considering how well jenkins directed the film up until that point i do n't think it 's unreasonable to question why the quality took such a dive so suddenly especially considering we know dc and it 's producers to be very involved in its franchise and not always for the better .
what i do n't get is why tj if he truly does not want ben to continue dp did in fact take down his own the end of dp '' videos on his own channel .
unless he was open to negotiating whether ben could continue dp at first and then ben jumped the gun without tj 's consent and now tj is putting his foot down .
i 'd actually prefer something less mission based tbh i 'm finishing up ffxv right now and ds3 seems like it 's somewhat of a similar game rpg-wise .
the temporary blurriness is probably from the lens rotating .
other toric xr brands might rotate less on your eyes but will be similar in price .
other options include wearing glasses instead of contacts wearing non-xr toric contact lenses up to 2.25 or 2.75 cyl and either accepting a little blur or wearing glasses with a little bit of cyl to make up the difference over the top of the under-corrected contacts possibly only when driving or other activities when you want optimal clarity wearing one of a wide variety of rigid gas permeable contact lenses some of which you can get for under 50 per lens online and wear for 3 years although the fitting will be more expensive and the optometrist may want to put you in more expensive versions getting lasik etc .
the cheapest would probably be rgp contacts assuming you can buy them online the fitting cost is n't too much and they 're comfortable some people ca n't stand them although they could also be very expensive if your optometrist tries certain types or brands .
that shade looks really disappointing but maybe the glitter glue is exactly what 's needed .

the trump camp had a mole in it that is definitely interesting .
but i suspect we have different reasons for finding it interesting .
the trump campaign was regularly being fed dirt on the clintons by the kremlin. tsk tsk .
russians were certainly fishing for something using the lure of dirt on hillary as bait .
but you will remember that trump jr was disappointed when the russian lawyer did n't have the proffered dirt instead wanted to talk about the orphan issue .
the gop tried to suppress the transcript by opening up a bogus investigation against steele try again .
it was fusion gps that insisted on testifying behind closed doors .
there would have been nothing to suppress if they had testified in an open hearing .
who does n't believe that the house republicans are trump pawns were they trump pawns even before trump ran for office ?
because republicans have been going after hillary since the 90s
i worked at a place that let you have 2 free postmix drinks per shift .
people used to just help themselves but they put in a new pos system with fluid metering on the postmix guns beer taps spirit dispensers so they had to get the pos company to add in a feature that let them get put through using the employee swipe card .
honestly i can imagine list like that can be old and/or forgotten .
like if it was a updated to this date list i 'm sure that would be bigger news .
also if it is that the feds would n't tell us because it would be sensitive information .
i 'm sure that list and them stating they found it is to get the wiretaps popping .
its unconfirmed but its probable that season 2 will be in la as well .

i just decided to mess around with some of the more major cryptos myself..
i 've thrown about 2k a little less actually since dec ... totally expendable cash ... a bit of bitcoin just to say i have some lol and then a few litecoin .
now i 'm going to try to just forget i have it until i hear that one of my coins has increased in value enough to recoup my entire investment maybe even turn a small profit and at that point i 'll sell 1 then rest on my laurels safe in knowing it 's all gravy from that point on .
gl and just do n't put anymore in than you 're willing to lose .
modern norwegian doesnt have too much problem understanding danish even with the latters phoneme to spelling mapping not being really recognizably 1 on 1 .
old and new icelandic both have much more regular mapping in both directions just to slightly different sounds .
i cant imagine them sounding more different than any two random modern mainland dialects more than 500km apart .
this is limited to standard old icelandic though and one can only expect there used to be as many dialects across scandinavia as there now are .
even something like old swedish would be much more deviant probably as far as elfdalian is to modern swedish .

the newspapers have a field day with your arrest playing up every lurid detail of the event drawing wicked cartoons of you and doing their best to make you seem like a depraved bastard for the sake of a good story .
luckily for you most of the people who read the papers understand this and will likely wait for the crown 's verdict before judging you too harshly .
unlucky for you 90 of the population can't read the paper and will only hear about you via even more overblown hearsay from traders and travellers .
there is n't much to do in the average rural village but talk so the people are always on the lookout for new gossip coming up the river .

neo team 7 has an interesting dynamic right out the gate .
as a trio they 're head and shoulders above their parents .
this is probably the closest i 'm going to get to seeing the sannin as children so i 'm gon na enjoy it while i can .
btw who else thinks it 's hilarious that the one who maintains balance between boruto and sarada is mitsuki aka the son of a super villain ?
nothing wrong with that but i 'm not interested in seeing ninja jesus a second time .
boruto on the other hand actually acts like a believable 12 year .
sometimes he 's brilliant other times he 's a little prick who needs to get slapped upside the head .
for obvious reasons not everyone will agree with me on this aspect of the show being better '' but i 'm enjoying it none the less .
secondary characters are being given more attention compared to the og series .
after neo team 7 's first mission is concluded we 'll be getting more shikadai action .
sounds like the writers are dedicated to making boruto 's supporting cast relevant which i 'm all for .
i 'm all for slice of life since they double as character/world building segments .
yeah this is another one that 's gon na be a bit divisive but if i had my way the new konoha 12 would do missions in each of the hidden villages so we can see how they 've changed over the years .
good god i really want to see shikadai hang with his uncle gaara or chocho chill with b .

what you need to do is set up a blind trust .
here you create an entity a trust or llc and name it something other than your name .
for example one of my actor clients titled his trust using an obscure quote from a former president of the united states .
unlike a politician 's blind trust he has 100 control of the trust assets and decisions .
this does n't completely cloak the account but it can make tying the trust to my client more difficult in an asset search .
the first had one sole purpose it 's set up to collect the winnings .
to keep your win as private as possible the claiming trust should have a unique title not at all related or traceable to you .
for example you would n't want the trust to have your name address or other identifiable information as the title .
this is because of freedom of information act rules .
the second bridge trust then receives the moolah from the claiming trust as sole beneficiary .
the reason the lottery proceeds are n't simply paid to the bridge trust is because the claiming trust helps to shield the true identity of the winner – it is cloaked to avoid determining the true owner .
the bridge trust however is not designed to protect the identity of the winner .
the details of this trust are not subject to freedom of information act requests so your name can be listed as grantor and trustee but because the trust name will be listed as beneficiary of the claiming trust which is subject to freedom of information act requests it 's best not to name the bridge trust with personally identifiable information .
if you do it right the winning lottery ticket whose payment details are subject to foia requests was won by at least one employee of blind cat llc .
on the payroll of this company is a lawyer paid by you and with your identity hidden thanks to client confidentiality laws that attends the necessary winner 's ceremony .
blind cat llc which is only in existence to act as blind cat trust 100 owned by you hands the winnings to signalofthecat trust also 100 owned by you ... and because this handover of money is n't subject to foia rules you 're finally named as the beneficiary of the fortune and there you have it .
you won the lottery and all people know is you 're one of many clients of the law firm that attended the mandated ceremony .

i intentionally display my tampons in a little mug on the back of my toilet in case anybody needs one and feels awkward rummaging around my drawers .

with any game i think the real problem is the publisher in this case activision is the problem .
not giving the developers time to make the game they want giving to harsh of deadlines and only focusing on sales and money made .
developers want to make the best game possible and publishers want to make money .
nintendo on the other hand cranks out great game after great game .
they want to make their money to but they clearly care about the quality of the product first .
just look at how many of their games get pushed back how many years we wait between new zelda games and then look at how many of their games get great reviews or get nominated or win game of the year awards .
more publishers need to put the product first and they will make their money .

you can help them after they 've taken enough l 's .
old timey pitchers use to do things like rough up a side of the ball or grease it up to help with the spin like you said but that 's against the rules now .
balls are very frequently lost home run or foul or changed out watch a game and you 'll see the umpire has a few in his pocket to replace scuffed balls and the ball in play should basically be like new .
the shrooms are kinda hard to find in montreal after the holidays .
i do n't think i own any higgings albums but i just read that he played with donald byrd and dexter gordon so i 'm sure that i 've already heard him without knowing .

if you are going to bring up freedom of speech then you should go for the nastiest fish in the room .
libel and slander are nothing compared to child porn .
and personally i think we should n't have made exceptions .
the founding fathers knew good well that they were n't going to see every possible issue and handle them all so they gave us the ability to amend the constitution .
i think we should take a no exceptions approach and instead apply amendments to the constitution to cover things that should be covered .
that said technically speaking the constitution does say the courts actually get to interpret what the constitution means .
so if there was an amendment that says all paper currency must be larger than 1 inch by 1 inch '' and the courts said that means that pepper is an illegal drug and that rock and roll must be played on all stations from the hours of 2am to 4am then that is what it means .
the problem is we have too much political apathy so we do n't get people to vote out those doing bad .
this is largely driven by first past the post voting and people who hate all the congress except their own representatives .

sophomore year i was a bit of a well a sophomore .
not a clown but i was a bit boisterous and loud in my english class pulling antics like coordinating everyone to google images of bill cosby since the school recently started utilizing chromebook monitoring programs like gogaurdian .
my antics to rebel such a system led me to installing linux by bypassing the enterprise management feature of these school chromebooks through software and then eventually hardware as they kept updating the chromebooks to make such actions more difficult .
now i did get detention for opening up around 20 of my aquantences chromebooks and installing galliumos linux that 's more optimized for chromebooks but it 's not the stupidest reason .
the stupidest reason is knocking my friends cap off in said english class a cap that he wore to hide his hideous hairline he got from a haircut .
he got so mad that he punched me right there and after my teacher saw how bad his hairline was gave me detention for embarrassing him .
edit just remembered the time i got detention for refusing to throw away orange peels in the desk i was sitting in .
i did n't fucking have lunch that day and i was n't about to touch some persons peels but i guess all 6th graders lie so i get detention for some persons orange peels .
i tried to sneak out after the bell but this fucking teacher pulled me out of my class 10 minutes later over orange peels .
not a universally hated teacher but known as a easy to anger one .
the usage is parallel the word itself is not .

i found a good model http saikai0.blogspot.jp/2015/03/rel-shinobu-bakemonogatari.html here but the model is in the form of an extension used for gta san andreas .
i converted the dff file into a vbx for unity use using a plugin on blender that allowed for import of dff files .
i also used a txd importer that extracted the bitmap texture from the file for use in uv textures for blender .
once i had the model and textures working in blender and exported as a fbx i used mixamo to rig the model and the rest i did in unity .
tl dr got shinobu model from site converted dff into fbx and txd into png rigged and set it up in unity for use in vrchat
there is probably a better model hidden out there but i didnt find any that were any good .

there are a bunch of versions with the regular greenguard '' variant being about 35 per tire and very puncture resistant .
you can get these for almost any bike so long as it 's not a race bike that only allows very skinny tires .
go to a shop and test ride a trek fx or whatever similar hybrid bike they have .
when you find a bike you like tell the shop you want to buy it with schwalbe marathon greenguard tires pre-installed and they can keep the original tires which you wo n't need .
a trek fx 2 is 480 a very decent bike and with the upgraded tires plus a helmet will meet your budget .
if your spouse weighs more than 170 pounds or will ride on rough surfaces the 38mm or 45mm wide tires are a good idea .
if the rider is lighter and will ride on smooth surfaces 32mm or 35mm tires are good .
if you are super-paranoid about flats and want to take absolutely no chances at all get the marathon plus https www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_plus_hs440 tires .
they are heavier and more expensive but set the standard in maximum puncture protection .

and how would the government provide housing for all these people relocated or would they just go homeless ?

there is a lot of information on mousesettings in this sub .
those should be off or low because they absolutely destroy input lag mouse jitter to a level that blizz should really remove them .
when your aim has n't improved after 200 hours it is likely that something hinders your consistentcy .
maybe even your mouse is just terrible my old one was jumping around so much that aiming was pure luck xd .
other thing is that your felt lack of improvement is due to accuracy numbers ingame .
also consider that you probably improved on a lot of things in 200 hours and you probably play against and with better players that also have better movement and are harder to hit in general .
i 'd tell you to think deep or deliberate about it but neither are the correct phases .

i know someone who works for them on maintenance .
they have a computer allocate jobs so an engineer can go to a location with 5 small maintenence tasks and 5 engineers could show up .
or one engineer could do multiple tasks simultaneously at a location but only one counts towards their target for the day because the computer does n't understand anything but sequential tasks .
or an engineer is sent from a job in liverpool to a job in glasgow .
or an engineer is sent to do a task he is n't qualified to do eg a plumber being sent to do electrics because the contract says someone needs to go even if the job ca n't be done .

i 've started writing my first feature-length film and i 've always planned short films just in a notepad but i 'm going to try using index cards for the first time .
i 'll try and describe this simply i have floating platforms that move left and right .
after moving one direction for say 2 seconds they switch direction and move to the left .
when this happens the player standing on them is 1 frame behind the movement of the platform .
what i mean by this is they will continue to move to the right for 1 frame before catching up with the movement of the platform .
not that big of a deal however i just added platforms that fall after standing on them for a second like these things http themushroomkingdom.net/images/ss/nsmbwii/027.jpg from mario .
because their speed gets incrementally faster it makes it much more noticeable that the player is a frame behind .
watch the player 's feet and see how he floats as the object drops .
vsp dir movespeed direction is always 1 for this object
if touchdown true if the player landed on the collapsible platform
if seconds_since_landed seconds_before_collapse if enough time has passed to collapse
movespeed clamp movespeed,0,20 clamp movspeed so it does n't get too fast
y vsp move the platform down based on the vsp math
if place_meeting x y-1-vsp obj_player obj_player.vsp 0 if the player is standing on the platform and they 're not falling still
touchdown true tell the platform that the player has landed
obj_player.vsp obj_player.grav subject the normal falling gravity so the player stays attached to the platform
obj_player.vsp_carry vsp add the platform 's falling vspeed to the player 's
i think it 's essentially that last line of code that would need to be modified but i 'm not sure how .
every step the player 's v speed is being influenced by the platform 's v speed but also the platform 's v speed is increasing incrementally each step how do i tell the code to essentially predict what the next step will be before it happens ?
if this is at all confusing let me know ... thanks for taking a look in advance .

be as specific as possible and include specific games or programs you will be using .
note beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy .
what exactly do you need included in the budget ?
need rest of the pc parts and an os .
which country and state/province will you be purchasing the parts in ?
if you 're in us do you have access to a microcenter location ?
if reusing any parts including monitor s keyboard/mouse/etc what parts will you be reusing ?
case cooler master haf 912 mid tower computer case with high airflow supporting up to six 120mm fans and usb 3.0
if yes are you interested in overclocking right away or down the line ?
are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build ?
ex ssd large amount of storage or a raid setup cuda or opencl support etc
ssd for os and frequently used games and lots of hdd storage
do you have any specific case preferences size like itx/microatx/mid-tower/full-tower styles colors window or not led lighting etc or a particular color theme preference for the components ?
would like to reuse my current case if possible .
no care for a certain color scheme but my favorite color is green .

can charge at the same time and use monitor peripherals
does anyone know of a definitive list of compatible phones with displaylink usb-c docks with references ?

not much is said about how specific value cie values compare and if possible converts to the srgb scale ?
i 'm in the market right now for a budget monitor with a min 99 of srgb color accurate if possible but most manufactures and sitesony give either or both cie values .
i am more familiar with srgb and adobe rgb but srgb is seen rarely on lower priced even used/refurb mid-priced monitors .

i run a realms server gallery with 4 other friends .
we only started the server a couple of months ago so it 's still pretty fresh .
so far we have achieved the following individually and together .
each have our own compounds with our own food supplies enchanting rooms storage rooms etc ... they 're pretty self-sufficient in that sense .
nether portal we have n't done much in the nether
zombie xp farm with a shop to sell rotten flesh .
we also have a lake to fish and public enchanting room there .
pretty sure we have gathered all trees at this point
pvp arena as a little side project i have built a pvp arena with the foundations of a scoreboard system .
we 'd like to be on this server for some time .
there are no plans to reset the server at this time .
we 'd like to keep building our own compounds and design esthetics but also work together for the greater good of the federation .
we occasionally have expedition parties that can last a few hours .
we most recently found our first forest mansion which was pretty cool .
about us 4 of us are in the uk and the other is in california .
we have all know each other irl for a few years now .
we all have full times jobs and most of us have families .
we each jump on minecraft probably once every 1-3 days on average .
we 're looking for 2-3 players that are looking for a casual vanilla minecraft experience but are committed to the server and to aesthetic uphold .
we do n't want ugly buildings no half cut trees no random holes etc ... ideally you 're also a self-starter with a good sense of judgement for what the server needs .
we do need more farms automated ideally mob spawners would be good too .
we want a beautiful but practical and pragmatic server .
if you must grief for the lols no irreversible damage
if you live within city limits you will be expected to aid the community and do your part
please let me know if you have any questions about us or the server .
if you 'd like to apply to join our server please send me some information about yourself .
it would be good to know a little about yourself age location etc.. and a bit about your play-style image links would be good .
if you 'd like to visit i 'm happy to arrange for that .
well my 2006 did n't come with a set of tow hooks and of really like to add some to it .

i 've been on cipralex lexapro for my anxiety disorder for 13 days and i 'm still only taking 5mg .
im supposed to up to 10mg soon but i 'm nervous about it .
for the past few weeks i 've been having really vivid dreams sometimes nightmares but either way i wake up at 6 or 7am every morning in a sweat and have anxiety and racing thoughts so bad that i ca n't go to sleep without taking an ativan .
it 's got to the point where i 'm nervous to go to sleep because i know whats waiting the following morning .
i really hope that the cipralex will start working soon .
i miss falling into bed and waking up the following morning ready for my day .
i use visual studio and i 'm trying to connect a js and css into an html file .
i wrote an event listener type scroll in the js file that 's set to console log text when activated and neither chrome nor i.e .
log that text when i scroll so i know the html is n't reading the js file .
is there some ubiquitous mistake that made by only the most amateur that causes this .
i guess what i 'm looking for is a list of a few troubleshooting tips .
i presented a paper at the conference and to do so i had to pay to join the organization pay a registration free book a hotel for two days pay for a round trip by bus and pay for meals .
i 'm sitting here playing terraria and it 's night time and out of nowhere it seems like the mob spawning went ten-fold .
like i had to magic mirror back just not to die .
first time posting here i received this https imgur.com/a/ejxmz present as a child 30 years ago and i love it i only use it once or twice a year when beach camping and it is super useful but it needs like 5 kilos of double d batteries and it 's becoming expensive and a hassle to be honest .
so i guess the question is if it is some kind of mode i can do to bring it to the modern era ?
i would like to keep using this one but if it 's a lost cause would you be so kind to recommend a similar modern one ?
do you guys have any recommendations for cafes in bilbao ?
i know about the cafe bihotz but i would like to know about other options too .
recent uptick in posts asking to rate non-users i.e .
while having these posts is fine once or so a week that is not the point of the sub so please limit how many are posted or we may have to instate a rule banning them outright .
thinking of doing a weekly post for that type of stuff along with rating other users who do n't want to make a post etc.
my variation of the deck revolves around controlling what your opponent can do and eventually either beating them down or through stalling with final countdown .
this is a very slow deck but for me has a very high win rate even against trickstar/spyral .
megalosmasher x 2000 attack normal water type monster that works well with pacifis the phantasm city and sea stealth attack .
i run 2 of these because in general when you run card of demise monsters are bricky .
in order to brick less i took out one copy of megalosmasher x and replaced it with fossil dig .
if your opponent has no set cards on their side of the field they ca n't activate monster effects on the field nor can they attack .
also if you manage to get 4 set cards on your side of the field your token and your megalosmasher x both go up to 4000 damage .
the deck really relys on this card so many of the cards in the deck are backrow removal to keep the monster negation effect up .
keep in mind to always have at least one facedown card on your side too because these effects apply to you as well .
final countdown alternative win condition that says if the opponent ca n't kill you within 20 rounds you win the duel .
i played this deck without final countdown for a while and i 've realized that almost all my games were going way over the 20 round mark .
this card is the reason the deck is 41 cards .
also a good reason for me to buy the fancy d20 dice i 've been eyeballing .
heat wave locks down the summon of all effect monsters until your next draw phase .
it 's pretty much forces your opponent to set and pass turn .
the more monsters you run the brickier your deck becomes so i run this instead of 3x megalosmasher x .
if you have no cards in your hand it lets you draw 3 .
there are no alternatives for this card it is mandatory .
generally if you open with this you want to set everything and activate it and then set some more .
keep in mind that this card will be reprinted in march so this card may go way down in price .
terraforming lets you search out your field spell pacifis the phantasm city .
pot of duality lets you dig through your deck .
pacifis the phantasm city heart and soul of the deck .
there is a reason i have 11 ways to get to this card .
it 's a field spell that says whenever your opponent activates a card you can summon a 2000 attack token if you do n't have one already .
it also says if you summon a normal monster including your token you can search for phantasm spiral battle and add it to your hand .
the card counts as umi '' and we also play some cards in the deck that requires umi '' to play .
if you control a normal monster and pacifis the phantasm city you can blow up any card on the field .
very good with performapal five-arc magician to destroy any set backrow your opponent would set .
drowning mirror force if your opponent attacks your life points directly send all their attack position monsters back into their deck .
i feel it is the strongest of all of the mirror forces and pairs very well with the fact that you run very few monsters .
metaverse lets you either add pacifis the phantasm city to your hand or activate it immediately from deck .
there 's no better feeling when your opponent activates twin twisters and hits your pacifis the phantasm city and a face down metaverse and you chain metaverse and activate pacifis the phantasm city immediately .
in that case your field spell is still alive and since they activated a card you get your token and the phantasm spiral battle search .
if you have a pacifis the phantasm city in your hand or graveyard this card activates it when activated .
if your opponent would try to kill any of your face up spells/traps you can banish your token or a megalosmasher x until the end phase and they have card effect immunity until the end of the turn .
you also get the card back that you banished on the end phase .
it also has the effect that your token always wins battles unless your opponent 's monster somehow has trap immunity like beelzebub .
another thing i like to do is blow my token up on my opponent 's draw phase so i can get another free token and search from the field spell when they try to do anything .
gozen match only lets you and your opponent control one attribute of monster such as water etc .
very good against decks that try to splash strange monsters into their decks .
it has 2 big effects that many people do n't realize though .
when activated your opponent has to send all monsters that are n't the same attribute to the graveyard .
the second thing is you can not overlay for an xyz summon into an attribute that is different from the original material eg .
2 water monsters ca n't become fire rip my extra deck
you and your opponent must set spells for wait a whole turn before you can activate it .
truly this card is just hate for pendulum magicians because they ca n't set scales while this card is active .
skill drain negate the effects of all monsters on the field .
you only run normal monsters so this does n't effect you at all .
heavy dust storm in a deck with performapal five-arc magician and anti-spell fragrance this card is a mvp .
blows up 2 backrow of your opponent for free .
the goal is to always make sure that your opponent has no set backrow so that performapal five-arc magician can get his effect off .
always use this card and phantasm spiral battle to make sure your opponent has no set cards .
have 4 set cards to utilize performapal five-arc magician 's effect and beatdown with 4000 attack pacifis tokens/megalosmasher x
have token sea stealth attack to keep clearing monsters and eventually beatdown with megalosmasher x when you draw into it
i 've been play testing this deck a lot and i find that the only way i ever brick is if i draw more than 2 pacifis the phantasm city or terraforming in my starting hand .
i 've playtested champion 's vigilance and spiritual water art aoi but i really did n't care for the 1 for 1 trades .
other than heat wave card of demise and anti-spell fragrance you can build this deck for under 20 easily .
also keep in mind that card of demise gets a reprint in march so it 'd be worth getting all the cards and just proxying card of demise until then .
please if you need any tips regarding my deck feel free to ask .
also if you have any suggestions i 'm more than happy to hear them .
following the establishment of the uar on turkish lands thousands of enthusiastic youth migrated to the new territories in search of work in what can only be described as the gold rush of the current century .
the cities of diyarbakir and malayta experienced an upsurge in immigrants seeking to make their fortune in the mines controlled by the arabian metals corporation .
slowly all aspects of life became controlled by the corporation as they controlled all of the trade in an out of the territories and took care of the security aspect as well .
within a few months the cities of diyarbakir and malayta expanded almost two-fold and amco gained significant power .
this has forced the government to intervene and declare the territories controlled by amco as an official and integral part of the uar .
as per this agreement the official languages in the new state are to be turkish arabic and kurdish and the rights of these minorities or majorities to be respected .
for years the turks have been an integral part of the greater arab nation under the ottomans .
they shall be part of this empire once again .
the uar now sets its sights towards central anatolia known for its mines .
perhaps this is the answer to all of our shortages ?

my wife and i just moved to a brand new house at the end of 2017 november .
we went to the city to claim homestead alabama and they said they did n't have the house in the system since it 's brand new .
they said we would basically get a pass this year and just pay taxes on the land without a house .
this feels fishy and i ca n't find any resources to make sure we are n't going to be surprised by taxes and a penalty for being late .

so i am a moron when it comes to plants and i thought this thing was pretty .
i did n't really think it through that it was january and it should n't be flowering but what do i know ?
it was 4 and i thought it was pretty .
so i got this cactus at lowes and as research shows the flower is fake/dead whatever .
the more important thing is what type of cactus is the flower attached to and how do i care for it ?
i 've already repotted it into a larger pot .
it 's about 1.5 times the size of a golf ball and mostly round .
the prickly bits look like they have white hair all over them like fuzz .
like i said i 'm a moron when it comes to plants i was just looking for something i could grow on my desk for a while and as needed i 'd move it to larger pots and what not .
i saw someone mention something called a golf ball cactus on here and i googled it and that is pretty much what this thing looks like to me but i know nothing about cacti or their names .
once i realised the flower was fake and i had no idea what type of cactus it was i knew the first thing to do was find the subreddit for cacti and figure out what to do .
we named her regina george because she 's wearing pink .
also can i leave the dead flower on it or should i remove it ?
i think it looks neat even though it 's fake so if it wo n't hurt the plant i 'm fine with it being on there .

i am a neet i had been bullied since i was born until i was 10 when i moved to the us a good fucking country who is n't perfect but who 's perfect ?
i started to make friends but i still was quiet and did n't know much about talking
you see i did n't even have my family they did n't even know how to take care of me and the guides they found on the internet just made it worse to the point my father is like someone who tortures you while wanting to do things for your own good does n't do anything illegal well in my country it was legal for him to hit me but he did n't abuse that power that much he did n't go easy neither over the line .
years had passed and i still have problems talking my voice sometimes does n't fit my words neither my tone and i most of the times find it hard to talk to people i am only comfortable talking on the internet without my voice i am a quiet guy who ironically would make a good voice actor but ca n't get a proper voice to fix his problems
and well i am lacking skills a voice that fits my word my voice is nice it just does n't fit me and i dunno how to not sound cringy or be afraid of sounding like that it really does n't help to talk and have people ignore me or look at me weird .
mostly quiet sometimes wanting to say something sometimes my voice ruins it and sometimes i am just afraid hours of my time wasted and well i tried to be one of those quiet people who do gesture but it 's hard without vr ... ..
i should give it another try but i have no idea how to even start a conversation or something oh well

hi could you tell me the best starters in top/mid for wich situation ?
i grew up in a really abusive home environment and i luckily got out of there by being able to get my college tuition and living expenses taken care of fully through scholarships .
unfortunately the abuse left me with a lot of depression and anxiety and i was n't able to get a job for almost two years .
because how fucked up life i was i did n't realize scholarship money would be considered income .
i always knew i had to fill out taxes when i actually got a job but did n't assume scholarships would be considered income .
recently i got a job where i have had some tax withheld from me .
getting a job meant i would file a return .
in the process of preparing the return i found out that scholarship money would be considered income at least partially .
this means i owe taxes on 2015 and 2016 income .
so now i am estimating using the tax return worksheet that i might owe taxes of around 500 for 2016 and some smaller amount for 2015 .
of course i am planning to file 2017 tax return .
my question is for the small amount it is what is the likelihood will the irs come after me for not filing the 2015 and 2016 returns and not paying tax for those years .
they never sent any notice to me at any address i stayed .

for reference i do n't just mean dumping the wind waker gamecube for the better the wind waker wii u or things like deleting skyrim because i bought skyrim se .
i mean things like i love etrian odyssey v and it has way better gameplay than persona q/etrian odyssey iv so i 'll never bother with those two '' or something like mario odyssey makes yooka laylee way inferior so i wo n't bother buying it '' that kind of mentality .

anyway ever since i turned like 17 reading has become not harder but more tedious .
i mean even as a kid i 'd do that thing where you ca n't tell where one line ends and the next one begins in a book or paragraph of printed text so you end up reading the same line several times .
but now that i 'm an adult like i said reading has become tedious .
for example there 'll be one line which contains the word dog '' and then not quite below it will be the word wall '' and my brain will take the l from wall and the og '' from dog and make log '' .
probably not but that 's the best way i can describe it .
well just now i read the title of a post on r/space which basically said cosmos renewed for 2nd season neil degrass tyson returns . ''
and i read it as cosmos removed for 2nd season neil degrass tyson warns . ''

i did n't feel paranoid though i was like interested .
like ooh big exciting shit going on fuck yeah .
i dunno if i 'm even dyslexic or not but psychosis is a concern of mine .
so yeah just wondering if i should be wary .

i 've recovered from surgery but i had nine months of bed rest followed by finishing intensive studies very sedentary .
i find it even difficult to stand for a few hours .
to get fit in the past i 'd usually just throw myself into exercising hiit cycling boot camp pilates ice climbing trekking etc which worked with no issues .
but i ca n't do it now i 've got lower back pain the result of losing my thigh and abdominal muscles .
plus i 'm no longer in my 20s where it 's relatively easier to heal .
has anyone had success with using a physiotherapist to help address this ?

int is similar to iota it is building a framework for machines and devices .
the token will be used to facilitate the resource exchange between nodes and heterogeneous links .
additionally the int platform does not require users to share data which will effectively address the user privacy problem with sharing data .
through decentralized and economy driven methods int is a new way to make standards for device interconnection in the rapidly expanding iot era .
it is similar to iota but targeting the chinese marketplace/economy .
they are partnered with ibm huawei and microsoft research .
http myslide.cn/slides/2287 page_top on slide 20 you can see the team discussing ibm/int
additionally int is partnered with zhejiang university 110th ranked university in the world .
int will provide solutions for zhejiang intel pharmaceutical 's drug packaging/tracking .
zhejiang intel pharmaceutical co. ltd. is a well-known regional pharmaceutical distribution company with more than 1,000 upstream suppliers and over 18,000 downstream end-users .
with this partnership int will provide supply chain financial solutions for small and mid-sized manufacturing companies .

it is roughly .30/coin with a 40million market cap as there are only 150 million circulating coins .
as of now the coin is listed on okex coinegg allcoin and coolcoin .
it is very difficult to find information on the project because it has not been marketed to the west whatsoever .
as the iot industry continues to expand there will be a high demand for projects like int .
with int having such an experienced team and very promising partnerships it is in a position to thrive long term with chinas vastly growing economy and infrastructure that can support the int platform .
once the western community begins to here about this project it is going to explode .
the current market capitalization is ridiculously low for such a promising project .
if so does anyone have any tips or strategies i can try ?
i posted this before but got the wording wrong .
i take 500 750 mg once to twice a week to help the social side at work .

what are they made of and how do they work ?
1. the catch 10-50-200 tiers of each type unlocks new clothes in the colour of that type maybe even different styles for ones that are pretty weather specific ?
the catch rattata/pikachu/magikarp ones would give shirts or hats with that pokemon on them pikachu ears ... . ?
catching all pokemon from a specific region unlocks the hat the player character has in the main game pls get rid of regionals ugh
jogger could give fancy running shoes i 'm thinking sneakers that get progressively fancier the higher the level
maybe not necessarily achievement based but maybe something for your anniversary for starting playing the game would be nice !
i 'm one of those people who really likes character customization but i also just feel like having some more rewards for completing these medals would make them feel more worthwhile doing even though the catch rate bonus is certainly great on it 's own .
i could n't think of anything really nice for the bigger deal ones like raids beaten or legendary raids but it 'd be nice to be able to show something off when you get it right ?
i 'm not sure how well this is really known among fans due to it not being on one of the records so i thought it 'd be a good pick for this week !

this makes it hard for me and other people to find just specific pokemon because of everyone who groups random pokemon in exchange for leles mostly or just packs .

i 've ordered 1p-lsd from 1plsd dot to month later package was delivered .
i put one piece of blotter containing 100 ug to 100 ml of distilled water in the fridge .
i have n't tested substance with testkit before trying .
i 've tried lsa years ago a few times from hbwr seeds .
knowing the 1p-lsd effects with volumetric dosing i think i 've never tried more lsa than dosage equivalent to 30 ug of lsd .
saturday microday 0 15 ug 15 ml of water with blotter
after maybe 20 minutes i definitely start feeling something .
i knew it already lsa had very similar effects .
a few more minutes later i start looking at my face in the mirror noticing more details than usual .
i could not get into flow state for maybe 1.5 hours .
then i start working being able to focus but i ca n't say i 'm more productive than usual .
for a few seconds i felt as if i was a person who has no idea about programming .
i trully understood what it 's like to take a look at programmers screen and understand absolutely nothing .
i do n't actually remember if i had any side effects this day probably i did n't feel that good .
all i know it would be much better if i made some notes .
during the 15 minutes walk i started noticing some effects more vivid colors .
poeple waiting for the bus made me think did it use to be always this way ?
did people use to talk to each other and not stare at their mobiles with earphones disconnecting from each other ? ''
i 've never had such a notice before it seemed quite interesting at that moment .
i could not get into flow state because it was open space distractions were distracting me more than usual .
after few hours i felt little anxiety and sometimes weird presence of something '' behind the window .
i knew it 's 100 irrational and i ignored it .
i felt as if i did something to my brain hard to explain .
speaking to other people required more focus from me i felt confused when trying to speak .
till the rest of day i felt waves of strange feeling like fog on the mind or burning on the top of head .
the weird feeling of fog on the mind did not stop completely but was fading away .
i felt a little bit disoriented when speaking yet more creative at the same time .
no anxiety no weird emotions just damn feeling as if my brain was n't working properly .
i found short memory to work worse than usual during speaking like i wanted to use some word and knew its meaning but it was not accessible .
i had doubts to touch 1p-lsd one more time 10 ug was definitely too much .
i decided to give it one more chance with lower dose but with slight fear of effects .
i was seriously concerned i did something to my brain .
for first time in my life i had one time cev for literaly a second when went to sleep .
engaging in conversasion and doing something helped not thinking about the 'damage ' .
i made a lot more wrong keystrokes than usual .
problems with short term memory which made speaking properly harder .
after research i have n't found a single case of anyone having such side effects of lsd/1p-lsd after microdosing .
i ordered ehrlich testkit to be sure ordered cartoons contain 1p-lsd
tested that yesterday and after few hours no color change .

i am 33 years old and for years it seems like my facial hair and body hair is getting worst .
i have always been fuzzy '' but now i have to pluck and shave my chin every day .
this causes me to break out and have hyperpigmentation on my chin causing a never ending cycle .
on top of this i have hair down the middle of my back and butt .

i am starting to write a new adventure to my players and it starts more or less like this all the pcs live in worlds like ours and one day they wake up in some sort of jaile .
what happen was that they were captured by a bunch of cultists from another world that are going to sacrifice them to their god .
by now noone of them has any weapons or a class yet .
which character to come in their recue sounds or will look more badass ?
a old man that looks a little bit fragile but in realty is pretty strong or a handsome cocky young boy ?
by the way this character will be quite relevant to the story because he will be known by every body in this world and later in the story the pcs might help him or smth like that .
plz if any one more experienced has some advise to which would be more memorable i give you my thanks .

then there 's about 35k who are either new or lol reddit fags or the type of people who watch imaqtpie

i think bill answered the question about why he was signed well enough to clarify that it had nothing to do with playing the steelers .
if you saw his press conference he had that death stare to the reporter the the is a very stupid question look and demeanor in his response .

the average number of deaths in farm attacks is 70 annually .
in almost 90 percent of murders the victims are black .
only about 1 percent of murder victims are white while whites make up 9 percent of the population .
you 're doing the same bullshit selective reading of statistics that racists in the us do when they are trying to prove racism against blacks do n't exist .
if you start the sentence with sure they kill way more white people than black people in a country where black people are the majority but '' your 'but ' better be followed by something other than 'they also kill black people on occasion ' .

i 'd rather feel alone because i 'm alone .
if there 's a sense of incompleteness or worthlessness it 's better it comes from some dark corner that your self-doubt calls home than from simply looking at the person laying next to you wondering why they do n't seem to love you back anymore .

personal attacks and bigotry of any kind is not allowed .
that is not a flashing from what it looks like to me is tar .
in reality it 's quite a simple fix you can buy both chimney flashing screws mulco caulking and shears at the big box store .
you can do a step flashing or straight you wo n't have to cut ringlets into the mortar as long as you use a good quality caulking like mulco .

i think a few too many late nights on google and a few too many editorials gave me an idea that it was a generally avoided genre .
i did n't mean for it to sound like people actually enjoy this ? i just had n't met anyone that has .
then again porn genres is n't a a popular topic of mine .
i was 14 and was about a month into my first year of high school .
a friend had just gotten a can cause he wanted to try it .
he asked me if i wanted to do it with him so i figured why not .

you can eat 2,000 calories of fruit a day or 2,000 calories of mcdonalds a day and it will be the same .

it was n't what you said it 's how you said it .

in person nah '' or no '' can be acceptably polite depending on body language and tone .
but online it should always be assumed that of what you type can be taken the wrong way it will be .
here he saw that you were having issues with toxic randos so he asked nicely if you wanted to play as a friendly gesture of goodwill .
no thanks '' or no thank you '' would have been better but still kind of abrupt .
personally if i did n't want to play with him i would have said something like i 'm not looking for a group right this second but i appreciate the offer .
not responding would also have worked since reddit is so impersonal and big .
people usually do n't go back to check comments like this unless they are replied to .
so when you do n't respond offense is usually not taken because the lack of response is n't noted .
however a rude or insensitive response will be noted since the person gets notified of it .
i know it was a preachy boring response and it seems like i 'm nitpicking and overthinking it and honestly i probably sound like a prick .
i just like manners and the art of conversation and it seems like there was a misunderstanding here that could have been avoided with better technique .

pen/accuracy is good but i miss more fully aimed shots than snapshots i hit .
you can pull off some dumb stuff baiting with the hull but it 's risky and stupid .
the tank already does n't have reliable armor so playing it as such at all times makes it feel a bit better .
dpm and mobility are way more valuable than randomly strong armor that does n't matter if someone aims .

probably not but it would be interesting to see the entity as a super op killer that can only be unlocked at a certain killer rank and played by survivors of certain rank 1-5 maybe .
he would just have to be this op because it does n't make sense for the entity to be inside of his own dream world that he controls and not be .
it would make for a neat high rank challenge mode though .
so did you try it if you did is it legit '' ?
i have a feeling it dates back to before the superbowl .
i 'm sure with quinn being defensive minded he probably prioritizes defensive philosophy which includes you always want your defense to be on the field as little as possible .

i have 0.46 of net worth in my checking account at the end of the month .
each month i get my checking account down to the minimum average daily balance at the end of the month to the penny .
but this still works out to be a good bit higher than it needs to be to maintain free checking and free bill pay being that it is calculated using the average daily balance .
this checking account only yields 0.03 in interest each month but i save about 1.00 in stamps and envelopes not having to mail two checks to folks who do n't take electronic payment of any kind .
for an emergency i can have up to 19.7 of my net worth in cash in two business days from my investment accounts .
i know this is indeed two days as i 've done this transfer three times in the past two years for auto and real estate purchases .
this equates to being a 31 month emergency fund using average monthly spending numbers two days away .
given that most emergencies could either wait two days for true cash on hand or be charged to a credit card i am comfortable with this setup .
even if there is a market down-turn tomorrow i will still have two plus years worth of monthly spending a two day transfer away which is fine .
keeping more than this in cash is an opportunity loss in money that could be invested .
thought it was just me and i got hacked for a minute lol had to change my pw

it is mostly male but there are a few girls scattered in the mix .
it also has a few current state/national gymnasts who go too so it 's not really a thing for beginners or people who are really rusty .

the way i 'm using to avoid wars is having an alliance which is larger in military numbers .
if morrocco has lets say 160k military units on it 's side .
i usually have full numbers of my regular army to avoid attacks .
additional ones cost diplo points which is not nice but that 's the price of not getting wrecked .
another way is to make ottomans not join the war .
as you are in the war already just keep your stacks larger than enemies .
sure ottomans has 133k but it will be in stacks of smaller numbers .
so if an enemy comes with a stack of 50 make sure you have a stack of 51 to avoid attack .
if you avoid fighting you can just siege his forts and hope they 'll run around confused .

dope is a industrial metal/nu-metal band that was founded in 1997 and immediately exploded onto the new york city club scene .
after only a handful of shows dope secured a major label deal with epic flip records in 1998 .
the band 's self-produced debut 'felons and revolutionaries ' was released in 1999 and nonstop touring fueled the band 's success .
dope did several national tours with acts like slipknot sevendust mudvayne fear factory staind static-x and kid rock earning dope a reputation for being one of the most exciting live bands of the new millennium .
dope 's non-stop touring and impressive live performances helped their debut release to soundscan more than 250,000 units creating the foundation that they would continue to build on in the years to come .
the track debonaire '' is notable for being used in the 2001 film the fast the furious .
successful headlining tours and dope 's second album life followed in 2001 .
the band 's sound matured and the record was received with excellent reviews by both the media and fans alike .
unfortunately the band 's two labels were not functioning well together anymore .
the label support and focus was non-existent for dope at this very crucial time and there was very little awareness surrounding the album 's release .
instead of becoming bitter and fading into oblivion dope decided to take matters into their own hands .
after confirming the band 's release from both of their original record deals dope quickly returned to the studio and created its third album group therapy a collection of 13 new songs which included a full-length music video for every song on the album .
with the major label jitters still fresh in their heads dope chose not to shop this new record to the record labels .
instead dope independently released group therapy in october of 2003 and set out on tour to promote the album themselves .
the band did several successful headlining runs and supported acts like mushroomhead slayer static-x and saliva .
independently group therapy has scanned nearly 50,000 units in less than a year .
in total dope has scanned close to 400,000 combined units in its career .
now that they have proven to themselves and to the industry that there is still a strong demand for dope the band has completed its fourth album american apathy and has inked a new deal with artemis records home of zakk wylde 's black label society kittie and sugarcult .
the new album is a return to the band 's roots with a heavy guitar driven roar and political overtones in the lyrical content .
this may very well be the strongest most exciting dope album to date .
dope has just finished up headlining the jagermeister sponsored american apathy tour 2004 featuring dope and former ozzfest acts motograter and twisted method .
the tour hit over 70 cities in 11 weeks .
dope utilized this tour to showcase songs from the new album and as the first step to begin creating awareness around the new dope album american apathy to be released this spring .
dope has survived the politics of the business and the ever-changing flavor of the month trends .
they are proving that they are not part of any one genre instead they have created their own .
ask anyone wearing a black t-shirt at a hard rock or heavy metal concert what they think of the band dope and they are sure to respond with devil horns and a smile .
reconnecting dope with the people is their goal in 2005 .
now preparing to release their 5th studio album dope has recruited a new drummer angel formerly of the genitorturers to kick off their promotional tour .
dope has recently released their highly anticipated new album no regrets '' .
the album was launched march 10th 2009 on koch records .
tracks included on the album include 6-6-sick '' addiction '' ft. zakk wylde nothing for me here '' was featured on guitar hero 3 and billy idol cover song rebel yell '' .
to date 6/13/09 the album is rated 4 1/2 out of 5 stars based on 21 reviews on cdnow.com .
after releasing album no regrets along with lots of touring after and before they decided to take a little easier and stopped touring regularly for a while .
dope started working their new album blood money part 1 '' and they dropped a few teasers from the album in 2012 and in 2013 which also said that the album would be released in 2014 .
in 2015 dope played a few gigs in russia for the first time with their original die motherfucker die '' line-up and they also recorded their very first live album in moscow .
live album titled live in moscow '' was released in 2016 summer with crowdfunding process via their website where all the people who pre-ordered the live album could f.ex .
have their name on its live albums liner notes and also could make the thermometer grow with their shopping at their band website .
thermometer had different types of goals like releasing live dvd and going to u.k. and europe for a tour .
after releasing dope 's first live album band announced that they will be releasing their long awaited album blood money part 1 '' in the autumn of 2016 also stating that the second part of blood money '' would n't take so long time to release as part 1 '' did .
dope released their first tour dates in usa for a long time after releasing their live album in summer .
the tour was called die mother fucker die reunion '' it including the original line-up from the life '' album .
blood money part 1 '' was released in october 28th in 2016 .
after releasing the record band went to russia and united kingdom as a headline tour along with the die mother fucker die reunion '' tour .
in the beginning of 2017 dope released some more tour dates for spring 2017 with co-headliner combichrist and support acts september mourning and davey suicide .
it 's been rumored that dope will come to europe to play some festival gigs in the summer of 2017 but nothing official yet has n't been released .

google chinese math book or japanese math book and notice that the digits are the same as ours 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 .

math is universal as you said and so does not require translation .
it 's true that i had different expectations since her first few singles all were legitimately big sounding ambitious pop and then the album was quite simplistic in sound and production .
i often like that kind of style though so chances are i 'll like it more if i listen more closely .

they can take a bit of adjustment to figure out and get used to wearing but once you are comfortable with insertion and removal they are fabulous .
i almost never leak using a cup and barely feel it throughout the day .
a few tips if you 're finding it uncomfortable 1 make sure the size is correct and makes sense for your body size .
this seems like a duh '' but cups can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes .
2 if your cup has a tail on it you can trim it down or cut it off to avoid irritation .
3 experiment with different ways to fold it when putting it in a single technique is not suitable for everyone .

so i had a pretty active account with bitstamp for many years which they decided to terminate out of the blue in august 2017 .
they just locked me out of my account which had almost 80 btc and a six figure dollar amount in it .
i sent them a withdrawal address for my coins with repeated reminders for almost a month with no response .
finally when i forwarded one of the emails to their regulator they sent my money and bitcoin out within a few days .
now my issue is that since i had the coins with them during the bch hard fork i am entitled to the bch distribution that they made but i have not received this .
i have been contacting them since the last 3-4 months but receiving only generic replies or getting ignored .
i am almost tempted to contact their regulator again since the 80 bch is now a pretty large amount but i imagine they must be pretty busy so this is my last attempt at trying to get bitstamp to pay me out my coins before i do this .
bitstamp if you are reading this my user id was 725413 and i have sent you my withdrawal address multiple times .
i have 2 amd graphics cards in crossfire but where do i plug in the cable from my monitor to the pc ?

i was looking at the smart contract for substratum https etherscan.io/address/0x12480e24eb5bec1a9d4369cab6a80cad3c0a377a code and have a few questions about it .
is it normal there is no max supply constant added in this contract ?
i saw there is a minttoken function for the token .
i can only assume that is what used to create the initial supply .
but with that i assume the owner can just keep creating more tokens at will ?
i guess this means they can just freeze any adress with this ?
they distributed the tokens supposedly manually during the ico because of issues '' with referrals .
how is this possible when you send your eth to the smart contract ?
is n't it supposed to automatically send you the token ?
i have come with an idea for a survalist re-work since a lot of people seem unhappy with the class .
a tactical reload increase reload speed with commando gunslinger and swat weapons .
b heavy weapons training increase reload speed with demolitionist sharpshooter and support weapons .
not even mentioning the fact that i had never in my life seen anyone use gunslighter swat or commando gunslighter weapons this is a bad choice if this is supposed to be a jack of all trades master of none '' perk then why make players have to choose between one type of weapon or another ?
second of all most people never choose tactical reload because a lot of survivalist use the rpg aa12 combo .
i guess the point of tactical reload its to make your medic weapons '' stronger but if you are gon na heal you may aswell choose medic .
a cryomancer fireguns and melee weapons freeze zeds making them 25 slower .
you can place traps on doors that freeze zeds as they go trough reducing their speed by 25 .
you can lay them down even if the door is broken .
b pyromaniac fireguns and melee weapons light zeds on fire which makes them panic and hurts them over time .
you can place traps on doors that burns zeds as they go trough making them panic .
you can lay them down even if the door is broken .
i didnt include firebug weapons on cryomancer because freezing zeds with a flame thrower doesnt make any sense .
explosive weapons arent included in neither of the two choises because you could just spam the grenade launcher all day freezing or burning zeds which feels a little too strong .
a medic training increase the potency of all your healing 20 and decrease the cooldown of your syringe and healing darts 25 .
b melee expert increase melee attack speed 15 inflict 10 more damage and move 25 faster when using any melee weapon .
this one is terrible most people use medic training because healing faster is always better .
i have never seen someone go melee as a survivalist .
b explorer health and armor increased by 50 points .
while wearing armor you dont take health damage except from sirens or husks .
explorer and survivor fit the whole survivalist '' theme of the perk .
you either focus more on healing others while healing yourself aswell .
a ammo vest carry up to 15 more ammo for all weapons and your grenade becomes a healing grenade
b weapon harness increase carrying capacity by 5 and your grenade becomes a molotov cocktail .
ok i dont think this is a bad tier players either choose to have healing granades or they choose the bigger carrying capacity for the rpg aa12 combo .
b hunter increase clip size with all firearms by 25 .
a spontaneous zed-plosion zeds you kill have a 20 chance to explode damaging and knocking down nearby zeds .
b make things go boom increase area of effect of all explosives 25 .
the big problem with this one is that most people already use explosive weapons on survival so they will most likely choose make things go boom '' .
not even talking about the fact that spontaneous blabla '' has a low of actually working
a eat this direct hits with explosive weapons apply tier 1 effects freeze or burn but decrease area of effect by 50 .
b dodge this increase area of effect of all explosives by 25 .
this two perks give the choise to the player to either slow or burn multiple zeds down while having a smaller aoe or have a bigger damage area damage reduction but no cc .
a zed time madman during zed time all your weapons shoot 3x faster .
b zed time lockdown during zed time the power of all incapacitation methods are increased 200 for all weapons .
again i have never seen anyone use lockdown over madman .
a zed time at all costs gain all the perks of the weapon class you are currently holding .
so if you are using a commando weapon you get the left or the right skill tree commando perks except of course for the tier 5 if you are using a cross-perk weapon then you still only get the perks of one class if you are using 9-mm pistols the perks are random
b zed time survivor you move in real time .
gain massive health regeneration upon killing zeds during zed time .
i couldnt come up with a good idea for this tier but i belive no option is better than the other one .
we are required to send one of these offsite every month so i ca n't be too expensive with my disk solution .

i was planning on chopping up my shrooms into a sealable tea bag and then steeping for like 15min along with some tea bags and lemon .
my question is can i just store the stuff in a thermos and drink at the beach like an hour later ?

you 'll know me from any clg twitch chat here on reddit or as discord mod .
no longer are the days that your post will be removed due to forgetting to put lol in your title !
instead we 're opting to use the reddit flairing system .
this will hopefully make the sub an easier place to use as well as allowing us to make some improvements in the future such as post filtering and css-styling .
we set up some rules to auto-flair your posts but please check your posts after submission to make sure it has a flair and that it 's the correct one .
the mods will flair your post if you forget but this would just make it easier for everyone .
submission flairs have been consolidated and a new flair misc has been added to handle any submission that does n't fall under the others .
we noticed that our moderation over this has been a bit lacking at times .
after discussing it a bit we decided to step it up a bit .
from now on all reactionary threads within 24 hours of a match ending will be removed and will be redirected towards the appropriate post game thread .
the post game threads will be set to sort by new '' by default so that people who are late will get their messages seen .
this should hopefully alleviate people who find that they get spoiled by the tone/feel of the subreddit posts after a win/loss .
hey guys i 'm somewhat new to league been playing for about 2 months or so and i am currently gold 4 .
i 'm looking to pick up taliyah as my main .
do you guys have any tips for me starting off whether it be on playstyle build order rune page general taliyah tips anything will be greatly appreciated thanks in advance .
cryptocurrency has no future if this is what 's going to be happening from here on out .
i am currently a level 11 just reached 3 days ago .
and have been in challenger 1 for 4 almost 5 months .
i have decent skill won the royal ghost legendary double elixer ramp up and even got 16 wins in the 20 win challenge only playing it twice .
somehow thought i can not make it into challenger 2 .
during the 4 month timespan in challenger 1 i have been 1 win away from challenger 3 about 4 times but everytime i lose and keep losing until i 'm at the bottom of challenger 1 .
the people i lose too are unbelievably over leveled with max rares and commons and for some reason so are the people i play on my losing streak .
i play with 5 level 2 legendaries level 12 zap thats my highest card level 11 bats and just got level 6 poison .
i just wanted to share my struggle to see if any of you are experiencing the same problem when you are so close to a new arena .
it really pissed me off today cause now i 'm not even close to challenger 2 when i was less than 10 trophies away .
got lucky and was matched up against a bad lavahound player !
a few days ago the index thread and the ffbot that controls those threads malfunctioned which required a temporary anything goes day time '' thread to cover the daily threads .
we wanted to take this opportunity to get community feedback for using a catch-all thread during day instead of index/daily threads .
all constructive feedback is welcome including unrelated suggestions to help improve the sub .
pm me for details i need a few people ios android to download the app and sign up .
takes less than 5 minutes i will pay 0.50 each .
edit i 'm now aware that it is united states only .
i dont know what happened to me but every year i feel more and more dumb .
i can feel that i definitely lack something in my head .
right now i am playing some computer game that i have been playing for like 8 years .
my performance is the worst i 've ever heard .
its just making me sad so much because i really want to be good at something and have fun from something .
i sat down at a completely empty desk and was working for like half an hour when this dude from the rich international student starter pack came up to me and said i needed to move cause he always sits here .
i held my ground like a strong uw student and instead of fucking off the guy just stood there and waited for me to finish .
i had to leave cause buddy was creeping me out but what the fuck .
is there anything else i could do about people like this ?
you could say i 'm a pop culture enthusiast like many others in the world .
i 'm not a huge star wars fan but i 've enjoyed the franchise since i was little .
i remember my dad tucking me into bed one night and i told him something to the effect of we should be like star wars .
i 'll be luke skywalker and you can be han solo .
my parents were divorced because my dad chose alcoholism over my mother and so i lived with her .
but he still came to see me sober ... most of the time just to hang out .
he was truly my best friend until i was around 15 .
i never saw him again until i was somewhere around 30 .
i called a wrong number and this woman greeted me as my father 's name .
i corrected her got into talking and this woman knew my dad !
i told her to tell my dad i was looking for him and hung up shortly after that .
couple minutes later i get a call from my father .
first time i spoke to him in 15ish years !
we met up at a late coffee shop that night and he greeted me with the best hug i ever got .
he saw me charged towards me and held me tight like i was something missing from his life .
we caught up with superficial stuff until around 4am .
from that night forward we visited each other semi-annually .
it was that infrequent because for some reason it was awkward for me .
it felt like it might have been awkward for him too .
this recognition that he did n't talk about the reasons why he left .
why he chose to be an alcoholic which he did n't seem to be anymore over my mother who was amazing .
i purposefully did n't contact him sometimes on father 's day and his birthday .
if things felt busy for me i put him on the back burner thinking he was n't there for us then .
why should i be there for him now ? .
but i still loved him and met up with him about twice a year .
when star wars force awakens came out i decided to go see it with him .
i did n't verbally bring it up but i had that memory of what i said to him when he tucked me in floating around in my head i 'll be luke .
han solo is killed by his son ... and when the movie finishes my dad says i 'm sorry howie .
i ask him why he was sorry and he replies because they just gave us the same story as the first movie .
i thought to myself but in the original it 's the mentor obi-wan who dies at the hand of luke 's father who went to the dark side .
he was luke 's best friend. it made me realize again that he once was my best friend not my mentor .
i was feeling more like kylo ren that night .
brooding with a mixture of longing for love and hate for the awkward absence of it .
it was n't the last time i would ever see him .
but it was the last movie i watched with him .
my father died last summer the day after i found out i was going to be a father myself .
i brought a picture of the sonogram to the hospital and showed it to him on his deathbed .
gave him the news while he was on life support .
i 'm still haunted that i forgot to tell him i love him while he was awake .
not of him but things that i was n't sure i was going to be able to remember because of my emotional state at the time .
while taking pictures i noticed the last picture i saved on my phone before his death was from this reddit post .
i found out where he lived and went to it a small apartment straight out of a hoarder 's episode .
his brother and i agreed to help each other clean the place out before we gave the keys back to the landlord .
low and behold i and i alone found a mountain of gay porn in his closet dresser hard drives boxes ... everything about his life decisions suddenly made more sense .
he was a republican and came from a time when being gay was all but a death sentence .
at the very least i wish he told me .
his heterosexual democrat son who works in the entertainment business would have understood .
i 've kept the secret from the family as i think that 's the way he wanted it .
i only shared the discovery with my wife and a few trusted friends and you the kind redditor reading this .
i think he tried to tell me once when he responded to family talk with i feel no guilt over ... well ... anyway how 's your food.
here i am three months away from being a dad myself .
everyone is excited for me while telling me what i have to do to be a good dad .
but nobody seems to notice no matter how many hints i try to lay out there that i 'm getting very depressed and feeling a very low self worth lately .
everyone has seemed to have forgotten that i 've lost my dad not too long ago .
i 'm not feeling too important to anyone except this baby right now and it 's not here yet .
i 'm having an identity crisis that has me afraid i wo n't be anything like myself when the kid gets here .
much like my father must have felt when he became a father .
my wife took me to see the last jedi when it came out even though she 's a trekkie that does n't like star wars god bless her .
but she unknowingly took me to the same theater i saw force awakens with my dad in .
it was the first time i 've been there since that night ...
so instead of giving into depression i went in with a new hope heh that the movie would give me a sign to get me out of the despair i 've been finding myself in ... welp !
kylo ren becomes stronger and takes control of the empire while luke skywalker ended up being a grizzled recluse due to his failures and died to protect a young new rebellion .
only made me more sad and scared for my future state of mind .
yet star wars seems to be the only thing i can turn to .
every time i try to talk about how i feel or make efforts to try and fix it i 'm either branded as selfish for not putting my wife and baby first or i 'm brushed off as if what i 'm trying to say is minute and easily relatable .
i 'm often answered with their stories that barely relate to my own and seem to do nothing but wax nostalgic for them .
i can only hope since star wars has become a herald unto my life that the next movie has better answers .

i live in the denver area and am looking for a shop with a smaller roaster that i could lease time on to learn on industrial equipment like others .
unfortunately my current living situation precludes me from buying a larger gas roaster otherwise i would .
if anyone knows of a shop open to teaching or at least leasing time i would love to hear from you !
otherwise i 'll start calling around/showing up on a regular basis which i may do anyway .
i can almost guarantee i 'm older than you .

i have a giant open space about 2x1 feet in her cage .
its in between her hidey house and her bathroom just open space .
should i staple a blanket to the wood frame of her cage or something ?
i dont think she likes the hard bottom surface .
the ump blaze is only possible on fn and mw and it is milispec .
there are industrial guns from the same collection that can be dropped on worst wears .
and my question is what happen if i use 10 ft industrial items from the mirage collection ?
is it possible to craft an ump blaze from it ?
fantasy slave trainer is a game that emulates the slave trade of a fantasy world .
the player gets to play as a brothel owner only one available at the moment slave breeder or a slave trainer .
slaves all have their own personalities and characteristics so the player must keep that in mind while they 're interacting with slaves .
you can now create a chattel that has a couple of pens you can have up to 5 that you can place slaves into so that they can breed .
at the end of the week you 'll see the results of their breeding the slave 's summary .
i 've also updated the week end ui so that its more organized easier to use and it looks much better too .
its works very similar to the main menu ui .
also i 'll now be labeling all updates as either major/minor .
major updates go public when there is a new major update .
minor updates are just the updates in between major ones .
pens will show possible offspring between slaves placed in them
recently born slaves goes straight to estate when estate overpopulated slaves will be sold the following week
i 've been experimenting with different uis and i think i 've got one that is a lot better than the current one .
you 'll be able to see the most important stats of your slaves and their name race title at a glance .
its also much easier to switch between estate residences .
i also updated hypnosis so that you can press space to continue as well .
the results of hypnosis are also on a separate page .
so people can test this out i 've added two new hypnosis options cum mania and masochism .
with this you can hypnotize your slave to be addicted to cum or a masochist .
slaves hypnotized to crave cum will react differently when ejaculated on

i 've never been with a thick woman in my life and it 's all i focus on lately .
i 'd love to play any scene with a beautiful big-ass lady but here are a few potential ideas
holiday with busty aunt my parents are going to the tropics for the winter this year so i go to my favorite cousin 's house .
it 's my favorite cousin because your his mom my hot thick aunt .
maybe you caught me jerking it back in the high school days and your eyes lingered .
you come stumbling out in the middle of the night wearing only a long t-shirt .
you light a fire and sit down to warm up .
i 'm drunk horny and i can see your luscious thighs ... and imagine the rest .
neighbor milf you 've just moved in next door as a caretaker after your mother passed away .
you 're in your 50s and just do n't give a fuck anymore .
you spend most of your time sunbathing in the backyard most of the time without a top on .
it does n't matter you have a little meat on your bones .
you 've popped out enough kids in your life to know men love nutting inside you .
you remember the little neighbor kid from back in the day but one day you catch me through the window next door .
i 've just moved home after college to help out the family business .
through the window you see me showering and you ca n't believe it when you see how hung i am .
so you make it your mission to investigate further .
you call my mom and ask that you send me over to help you with a chore .
girlfriend 's mom i 've always known you were conniving and my girlfriend told me to never trust you .
but when i 'm stranded during a blizzard and your home is the only shelter i have nowhere else to turn .
you put me up in her old bedroom off the laundry room .
i make up in the middle of the night to find you doing the laundry and dressed only in skimpy 80s underwear tight against your fuller body .
either reddit messages chatzy or reddit chat works for me
i honestly do n't know why we 're arguing right now if you agree that you know nothing about him .
im getting a lot lower fps than my friend who has the same card and a better cpu in the same game
there are a number of different apostates from numerous religious backgrounds in this thread and you singled out the ex-muslim exclusively to bitch about it ?
been trying to apply for a loan since last week .
the website keeps on giving me the message service unavailable .
sent them an email about the problem pero no reply sila .
i have purchased 5 ths 1100 at the beginning of the year .
i have been reinvesting since then and now i 'm at 5.5 ths .
if i keep reinvesting for the entire year i will lose the initial 1100 and each initial reinvest will drop off .
so is this profitable or is it better to just withdrawal the btc ?
yesterday 's post can be found here 13/01/18 https www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch/comments/7q90fk/switch_101_daily_news_130118
freedom planet may be coming to the switch link https www.facebook.com/freedomplanetgame/photos/a.1324772120870594.1073741827.491068344240980/1918545264826607 ? type=3 theater
since the huge surprise that was the switch 's success and rise to become the best-selling console in the us of all time it has become customary for developers to tease their games for the platform .
that can come in the form of a cryptic tweet or a totally obvious image and today is no different .
developers of the game series freedom planet showed off a not too cryptic or subtle image on the official facebook page .
this was their game placed simply on top of the switch with the caption are we doing it right ? '' .
now maybe this is all a complete joke and the game is n't actually coming to the switch platform but i highly doubt it as that would gain the company completely nothing when there is clearly a demand for the game to come to the platform .
here 's hoping that we get official word sometime in the near future .
maybe at the direct that will happen within the next 20 days ... . or maybe not .
another day another time when the splatfest results have come in and have made a lot of people happy/sad .
in case you are all unaware spatfest is a recurring online event where 2 teams are created from users in america and they battle it out in game modes to see who 's the best .
the event usually comes with a lovely set of team names and on this occasion team comedy has won !
it was announced on the official nintendo of america twitter that when the event ended team comedy only managed to win 2-1 .
an incredibly close game and i would like to congratulate both sides for a closely tied event .
lost my switch among other things but mainly my saves .
the switch is going to make my deployment a lot easier ... link https www.reddit.com/r/nintendoswitch/comments/7qcues/the_switch_is_going_to_make_my_deployment_a_lot u/harvestboygoobus
my parents told me i 'm way too old for a switch .
beware of fake switch cartridges label swapped easy to detect for now .
if there are any errors or missed information just let me know and i 'll add it promptly .
another ridiculously quiet day with no announcements updates or releases in sight .
since yesterday 's post i 've looked at all your comments and have decided to continue this series for another week before completely changing things up a little more about that in the near future .
anyway thank you to all the reddit folk who gave me permission to use their posts from earlier today it is much appreciated !
have an absolutely wonderful day and i 'll speak to you all tomorrow !
hey reddit over two years ago 9/15/2015 my girlfriend received one of those red light camera traffic violations in fl .
thing is the video clearly shows that she stopped before making the turn .
the letter only notified her of the violation and had no further instructions for what to do so we kind of just ignored it .
now 1/09/18 she received a letter for a summons to court and we 're not sure what to do about it because we 've moved across the country to or .
also since it 's been a full two years since the last time we have even heard anything about this are n't we under 6th amendment rights to just ignore this because we were n't given a speedy trial ?
her license was apparently suspended 10/24/15 and she apparently pleaded not guilty on charges 11/05/15 and it shows that we paid a 16 late fee but i do n't remember doing any of this because why would we voluntarily pay a late fee and not just the whole fine ?
me and my brother are coming back to runescape after years and he discovered that apparently his account got hacked and permabanned and he thinks the same happened to mine .
does anyone knows about hacking in runescape or if there was some kind of database leak ?
and about his account that he knows that was hacked can he get her unbanned if he proves that he is the actual owner ?
rock gnome evocation wizard here character is aptly named gorignak .
we 're doing the starter pack lost mines although this is n't this group 's first campaign .
we rolled new characters for funsies when we started it .
spoilers for lost mines of phandelver by the way .
so we 're going to see this druid who has information about where these lost mines are and we come upon the ruined town .
the sign said there would be plant monsters and undead so i 've got burning hands and chromatic orb on the mind when i see a hill with a house on it .
i go up the hill into the house notice a smell and go exploring and my dm just lights up .
so i poke my nose in a room and suddenly my little bitty gnome nose or gnose '' if you will '' is closer than i 'd prefer to the snout of a young green dragon .
i 've got my hands up in the somatic component of burning hands https vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/f/f1/players_handbook_5e_-_wizard_burning_hands_-_john_stanko_-_p220.jpg/revision/latest ? cb=20150110123803 and i just freeze for a moment then calmly back out of the room .
the party 's justice boner paladin is right behind me though and he plays pretty heavily that his character must fight it .
me and the other wizard went down in round 3 to a breath weapon luckily it fucked off after we had taken it down to like 50 points it started with 100 and change apparently .
dm thought it was hilarious that we inadvertently went straight for the biggest baddest enemy we could find .
my overcast keeps creating a blank playlist called queue and no matter how many times i delete it it keeps coming back a minute or so later or whenever i reopen the app .
magine a cod game that is every call of duty wrapped together into one big miracle .
i know its not plausible due to different developers but just think of this .
they make a game that is n't set in a certain time period and everything goes .
in this game you have all the best/most liked weapons in all the past cods along with maps perks and game modes meshed together to make cod era 's .
hello i bought the game yesterday and the english voice acting is terrible anyone know how to put japanese or korean voice ?
i search about it already and i do n't find the game option about it or any voice pack
i think some of the lyrics contained if i die young or maybe just the words young
it sounded dramatic and faded out at the end .
if i get a family plan is that possible ?
i do n't want my library mixed with other family members libraries .
i am a 17 year old high school student who is applying for college .
regarding financial aid my college wants mine and my parents tax return transcript .
my parents created an irs account and linked theirs so they are fine but i need to make my own account to get my transcript .
problem is i am only 17 years old and dont have a credit card loan or mortgage that i can use to verify my identity .
the first game i got into today was incredibly laggy .
i was rubber banding for more than half the match until we got down to roughly 30 players at which point it completely stabilized .
but from the lobby up to that point i was rubber banding almost every 5 seconds .
the parachuting lag was definitely fixed but on-the-ground lag is just as bad as ever .

as the title says beat samoa joe at mania for the belt my dude despite being a heel decided to turn on joe without any input from me and formed a faction with seth rollins and a person of my choice finn balor in this case .
after this hhh gives me the whole you 're our guy now '' speech .
then the trophy for finishing the main story pops .
and i 'm back to a holding pattern of people telling me to cut promos on people and fight others .
so i figure i 'd ask here what now ?
or is it just an infinite loop of nothing ?
welcome to another edition of whatever they throw on knr during the evening .
this in my opinion has become a big issue .
i understand what purpose the selection holds but it is allow 5 stacks of 100 ping to ruin games of ranked and casual .
what are we meant to do to stop an un-headshot-able 3 speed that can absorb bullets like no one 's business .
it may be a select few but they 're ruining my experience and the experience of a lot of my friends too .
an alternate option is to not allow more than 2-3 people in a squad/team to have greater than 50 ping because it would at least limit the amount of ping abusers we 'd have to deal with .
it could tie in with a nautical theme too !
it could be like in lovecraft 's book at the mountains of madness where a crew called the miskatonic university expedition who travel by ship a antarctica and come in contact with the elder things ! ! ! !
en omista ylimääräisiä pringlespurkin kansia mutta keittiössä olisi muovikelmua .

ok i 've been thinking about this a lot what makes the courier special ?
a lot of games have the protagonist do stuff that other characters do n't seem to be capable off but a lot of times there is at least some explanation .
gordon freeman has the hev suit in half-life which allows him to survive and beat the odds characters in high fantasy settings are often the chosen one '' in some capacity so there is fate or something guiding them .
kotor 2 has a really neat in-game justification for the exile gaining power basically explaining away xp you gain part of your enemies ' power by beating them .
there is no fate or a higher power guiding them they do n't appear to have anything special .
sure there is a pip-boy but if it made you into a superhuman by itself the doctor would n't just give it to you .
the only noteworthy thing about the main character seemed to be that they survive a shot in the head .
does n't appear like this is some sort of special ability '' but a fluke that still works in the courier 's favour .
at any rate not something that would justify him or her being such an influential figure .
then it occurred to me that the courier is you know a courier .
that does n't sound like the job for the weak they are n't just delivering mail down the block they trek the wasteland that is infested with lizards at least as big as children ants bigger than two grown humans deathclaws and even more .
they must be quite tough and/or resourceful to survive and keep doing the job .
the main character has been a courier for quite some time now so it 's likely they were quite good .
i suppose the levelling is justified as the courier regaining their skills after the incident .
ok it 's not a perfect explanation but it 's good enough '' at least .
sure that works but there are still gaps that i 'm not entirely sure how to explain .
the courier is still shown to be vastly more capable than most people .
you take down a fiends with a bounty on his head and the ncr guy goes i 've lost many soldiers on him how did you take him down '' ?
uh i went and shot him in the face a few times .
why what did the trained military do try to bribe him with candy ?
i really ca n't fathom how that was any sort of challenge for the ncr yes they might be short on troops and morale but they did have enough forces to send out in fiends territory yet they failed .
so it seems like a big disconnect between narrative and gameplay there .
even if the courier is supposed to be a badass to begin with it almost implies superhuman abilities .
sure i get that he is happy to recruit the courier especially since benny 's betrayal .
i get that the courier would be interested in helping out to get to benny .
i get that if the courier works for mr. house then that obviously makes the ncr and the legion interested in that person as well for they have access to the lucky 38 .
but why is mr. house ready to trust you with access there and to work for him ?
i ca n't find anything that makes the courier inherently trustworthy especially to mr. house who does n't trust anybody .
for a guy who has laid plans for decades in advance and is meticulous in terms of details why did he just decide hey i 'll hire this courier to bring the chip and give them access to my most guarded secrets and even access to my casino something i did n't even give to benny who i was grooming to be my closest and most trusted agent .
i 'm sure they wo n't just decide to double cross me and/or ruin my plans especially since they have almost nothing to lose but more to gain from it . ''
yeah does n't sound like a smart plan from a smart guy .
did mr. house just have the brain of a 10 year old child in a jar and just delegate that part of the planning to it ?

i really want to attend a research program over summer .
there are no universities offering summer internships with reasonable commute times that do n't charge 6000 for two weeks .
my parents will not let me apply for summer programs that would take me away from home even though they are free and most provide stipends .
how bad will it look if i do n't do anything substantial over the summer ?
would it be frowned upon if i just took some summer classes from cc and went on a vacation ?

i am not a crypto scholar by any means but after being involved in this space for six months i just cant see any way that bitcoin can continue to rise .
it might be the coin that currently holds the most brand name recognition but i do n't really see any reason to buy it anymore .
alts have really taken over the space and seem to be providing so much more utility .
do you really think there is a future for bitcoin or will it slowly die in the gutter ?
the developers have clearly worked hard on creating the game and making it fun and fair .

but the one 's that had freeflowfridays '' in the description and tag was n't place higher even when it had similar views and date .
i hate to do this to our side but it appears that ukraine has a fascist problem albeit a very minor one .
in downtown kiev there is a fascist literature club called plomin ' ukrainian пломінь english flame .
on the walls the decor contains a quotation and the face of fascist philosopher sophist julius evola a direct ideological influence of aleksandr dugin whose ideas influenced the current fascism of the russian federation especially its foreign policy toward ukraine as well as the ideological foundation of much of the alt-right in the united states and the quotation and face of corneliu zelea codreanu the leader of romania 's clerical fascist organisation the iron guard .
a young self-proclaimed philosopher svyatoslav vyshinsky is documented to have held several lectures there whose work focuses on something called metaphysics which is a pseudoscientific interpretation of what essentially comes down to as identity politics done through a rejection of empiricism as a means of measuring reality — it runs counter to the philosophy of the enlightenment which provided us with the scientific method exclusively through which we have progressed so much technologically — if you can call it a field of study metaphysics is consistently used by third positionists of all stripes to justify romantic nationalism creating a religious fervour around the concept turning it into what appears to be a european jihad movement .
to a fascist the cause becomes holy war which is ironically absolutely counter-productive to the material ills that prompt them to turn to this inarticulate attempt at a solution there appears to be an incredible illiteracy of facts that include that people outside of cults will not work for free to achieve a common goal .
capitalist means will have to be applied to try and progress these compensatory ideals of faith honour and loyalty all of which are escapisms from poverty .
when employing capitalism the target then becomes heartless profit and often the means then become contradictory to the emotional theatre upheld by fascist literature .
the practice then becomes realpolitik and calculated intellectualism overtakes the fascist promises of anti-intellectualism 's triumph .
for so many reasons the movement is a pure cult the members are given euphoria while the leadership betrays the ideals for material gain .
the ruse at the same time breeds embarrassment in the eyes of pragmatic outsiders .
a final point in the employment of the ideological founders of the enemy 's doctrine is that there becomes a risk of organisations like these finding very large amounts of common ground with the enemy 's ideologues .
if not then you 'll witness two sides fighting a self-proclaimed holy war for a sense of pride they themselves are not smart enough to afford to earn through material means .
ukraine needs to stick to social democratic principles and co-operate with globalisation .
to do otherwise is to swim against the only practical stream .
by trying to do so firstly through social policy especially by way of totalitarian cult religious means the material result will be as stagnant as the starting position or worse .
there is smart nationalism which is the defence of your property within a larger collective boundary-based state and there is stupid nationalism which is embodied in superficial slogans chants colours flags and poetry .
anyone know of certain coins that work fine together ?

built the rig and all worked as expected installing windows etc no blips .
after flashing a few cards with a new bios in the onboard pcie and installing afterburner i finally moved the two cards to the risers .
i started the rig and claymore booted with the expected results however after 30 minutes one of the cards blew up literally spat a load of white powder and started sparking .
i removed the power and the card and i have left the rig since .
how can i confirm if the issue is the gpu or psu as i see many parts mentioning the psu will potentially be faulty .
last thing i want is to burn my house down or blow up a load of cards .

i was on shoreline and i tried to engage some scaves at the military checkpoint near rock passage .

i feel like no one cares about my boy cracker lately and that he is unfortunately thrown to the dump by the community .
tbh i want him to make a comeback right at the end when luffy and company miraculously run away after big mom eats the cake .
cracker sits on the top of a roof where he eats one of his biscuits while looking at sunny sailing away from big moms territory and then say something like dont think this is over mugiwara you havent seen the real terror yet .
i feel like cracker was too reliant on his devil fruit powers and he didnt take in to consideration what the world really is like outside of his comfort zone that his mom has been providing him with all this time .
because compared to oven and daifuku that i dont really feel any emotions towards i feel that cracker has that potential to seek after more power along with his badass big brother katakuri .
plus katakuri is a master of kenbunshoku haki and cracker is a master of busoshoku haki .
i feel like these two would make a good combination .

they are slow they have high fees and do not really have any partnerships with big companies to further their development .

since we are getting the horizontal-ish recoil back the camera obviously will shake more since it 's simply like this with a horizontal recoil and the recoil always stays in the middle of the screen .
but it was only this bad because the recoil goes too far out horizontally it should go as far as it did like in ps3 and then as soon as someone starts spraying the anti spray mechanics kick in ...
this way the camera wo n't shake like that anymore and the recoil/camera would be more like ps3 without making it sprayable ...

it 's kind of like purchasing the natasha denona palette at a discount with lots of full-sized freebies thrown in .
unfortunately most of the products are stuff i would n't actually pick out if it were up to me .
i had mixed feelings about the natasha denona palette for instance because i only stick with neutral mattes moreso this palette is n't cheap .
since i have it now i can just try it without the pain of handing out 129 with just one palette in my basket .
also mine was shipped out friday got it today which is impressive for international shipping .

if you own all the episodes besides one and you 're playing on consoles the 35 goty upgrade intro pack gets you all the remaining content .
as i said above the 'value ' of that specific pack will depend on how many episodes you are missing .
for a player that only purchased the intro pack they will get more value for the money .
that 's who the pack is intended for as you can tell from the name .
on steam they use a 'complete ' the bundle system where you just pay for whatever you 're missing .
that is a solution of sorts but one i think can easily turn into a farce depending on how determined opponents of these rules are likely to be .
i think the odds of that transpiring are fairly high but i could well be wrong about that .

i live in oklahoma city and directv has to be the worst t.v .
of course we do have our share of thunderstorms too however the service cuts out for 15 to 30 minutes almost every time it rains .
i recall this past summer our service went out and a message appeared on our screen that said due to an increase in solar activity the service was unavailable .
i think it was when we had a large solar flare .
you would think that directv would have properly shielded their satellites from that kind of interference .

this makes me think of one popular nsfw artist in particular shadman
he plays into all of those genres you just mentioned .
he is also active on twitter even jokingly mentioning/tweeting big names while including one of his artworks in his tweets .
he may have had times where companies and such try to get him because of his shenanigans but he still stands strong to this day always staying relevant .
he even uses subjects that are trending on his pieces so even he does n't stay under the radar when people search that trend and find his works .

we have pointed to the issue once again and expect the finance department to respond in the shortest time possible .
he was very clingy and she ai n't about that life .
seems like an odd choice given that so many android phones are on the market .
i usually just grab one or two outfits just from events that i like and i usually buy the monthly cards during recharge events .
for example during this event i have n't spent a single diamond .
both are good but malazan is like no other fantasy series .
the structure of the series is crazy too it 's like the tarantino of epic fantasy stories !
if you hold on a wallet you can claim every 5 mins or whenever you like same difference .
exchanges allocate the same gas but only give it to you when they want to .
please ignore most of the vitriol in this subreddit .
literally most of the people that are complaining are doing so because one of the characters being unplayable and because epic has been on winter/holiday break .
some qualms with the game are valid and people have their problems which is fine .
but the level at which people are making this game out to be bad are highly hyperbolic .
if you 're enjoying the game welcome new player i hope you enjoy your stay .
12 of swedens population is foreign born and that is n't including previous foreign born individuals who had children .
i just had an independence player who was awesome .
he spotted the whole time his fighters warded off the red team 's strike 3 separate times for me alone .
peter should see things clearly with naked eye after the bite no the other way around .
all the comments below are from people who went to bartending school .
here 's the plan i going to blink three times and kill that dying supp on their backline then recall out of the there ! ''
we could possibly do with another winger at leinster 🤔
hard to justify benzema staying bb with how bad he 's been .
lol the is7 bar is so low because its got the highest player count in the game and only 1970 avg dmg because nothing but noobs play it .
thats almost as bad as a tier x medium tank .
i had a ticket when they 1st listed eca took 48hrs to resolve you will be looking at a bit longer now i would have thought
it will be down in about four or five hours .
because the sdf helped us and erdogan is working against us .
i 'm honestly disappointed by the top posts on there .
the turbine and swing one were kinda cool though .
you realize that the only pictures of the two together were covertly taken by someone at a table across the restaurant where they were eating ... they were n't walking a red carpet together or making a public appearance in front of the media .
do you think she asked for someone to creepily take a picture of the back of their heads and sell it to tmz just to get back at ricky ?

i honestly do n't think that they will expend two bfs really on .
i know musik said so in iac 2017 but really it will be a more important local goal to recoup rnd costs and build a stable capital base with the first bfr/bfss substituting f9/fh for core revenue generating business .
no it 's possible that it may have created hairline scratches but it 's just cosmetic .
the issue with antistatic brushes is that they often just push the debris around or sometimes into the grooves .
a working day by ben folds and nick hornby .
as long as the hell of it from phantom of the paradise is in the credits idc .
in a way it 's smart because for all those people who really disliked the lack of nostalgia in tlj a fun caper with a young solo might just hit those buttons .
i seriously dont understand how people like you are able to survive in this world
i must ask does the warcrime pthr come with the us decals or no ?
so do you think a 1700 wo n't make that much difference ?
i work for gap hq and had no idea we were selling into marshall's/tj maxx so there you go !
they didnt expect him to side swipe all those cars after the right tun on 42nd catching up to him in midtown traffic was a reasonable idea .
i bought the game standalone probably half a year ago did n't get into straight away then recently i 've really got into it so decided to buy eight of the ops in the 'y2 8 operators bundle ' there 's also a 'y1 8 operators bundle ' so i have more variety with who i can play and i was just going to unlock the y1 special operators using renown .
i did n't think it would be this complex tbh like you 'd think regardless if you 've go the dlc as a gold edition or whatever they call it a season pass or a bundle it would not make a difference you 've got it .
i suppose i 'll try that then just thought i 'd try here because it 's helped me a lot when it comes to the gameplay side of things .
i dunno man a roasted weenie anytime and anywhere sounds pretty good to me .
i 've read/own both but i 'm more familiar with siken 's book war of the foxes .
my current faves other than siken are warsan shire and robert montgomery he does visual poems in neon/painted signs .
of shire 's i just finished reading teaching my mother how to give birth and it was really good and she has a lot of other poems you can see online .
however both of these poets are more rambly/political/existential like war of the foxes i 'm not sure how to get that specific personal crush feeling !
i 'm currently reading beyond rock bottom by kara petrovic and it 's worth checking out in that vein .
does n't stop an aspect like zoe from fucking with him relentlessly
in all srsness zoe actually protects asol from pantheon whenever he 's being oppressed by the aspect of war since she considers asol her pet
it is run of the mill shit and yet it is n't treated like this is happening all the time .
that 's the point of the me too movement .
if you are n't trying to defend this why are you writing ?
tales from the crypt demon knight had a surprisingly interesting mythology to it and it disappoints me that it was never explored further .
the flag of crait mineral planet and resistance outpost .
the red and white colors are inspired by the planet 's white surface and red soil .
the star represents the resistance fighters and their battle against the first order the spark that will light the fire that will burn the first order down. the star hangs onto the red chevron by a single point symbolizing that the resistance is the last hope for the rest of the galaxy to stand up to the first order .
as much as i love him he definitely needs some work done .
his ult is pretty shitty and can easily be interrupted .
the maps i use him on are what makes him worth wild to me which is illios lijiang and the sanctum map of anubis .
those maps you can get easy boops consistently which is great and he does decent damage with his left click as well if you have decent aim and can get head shots .
he 's definitely a support but if he 's on one of those booping maps he can be played as boop flanker especially early on in the match when you are first pushing towards a point .
flank to get a boop or 2 and then go back with the team dont try to stick around to long or you will be picked off pretty easily .
as for using speed vs healing he can not solo heal very well so for the most part i switch every few seconds between healing and speed and only use amp it up for healing rather than speed unless its at the beginning of a match or running into a team fight .
he 's probably the best staller in the game on points where you have places to wallride other points i 'd probably say its mei/a good tracer because you can easily get up high on a wall and keep speed boosting around making it hard for you to be hit especially with the movement changes in the last patch .
also if you have n't done it yet turn on the setting for backwards wall riding .
this sub is as garbage as its mods are .
meant to unsubscribe after i read the pretentious ass sidebar so go ahead and ban me .
you 're an incompetent moron moderating a tiny subreddit that nobody cares about .
ca n't handle opposing viewpoints and take the first opportunity you get to silence them .
toughen up next time you and your butt buddy get your feelings hurt way too easily .
well my thoughts/recommendations and you certainly do n't have to accept them
it can easily take up to 6 months or more to get to know someone really well .
a month or two is pretty dang short all things considered .
now ... if you 're still approximately at the same point at say a year or two or five or ten and you 're looking for ...
i do n't know say marriage and commitment and she 's not that solidly into it then maybe time to go different directions .
in the meantime talk about what you both want and your gu estimated timelines for different stages or whatever presuming you both continue to be at least sufficiently satisfied with the relationship .
does it go where you both want or at least close enough '' in terms of sufficiently matched and at least overlapping targets on when/where/how you want to go ?
does n't mean your preferences need line up 100 not at all but they have to be close enough '' to be reasonably compatible and that you 're both at least sufficiently satisfied .
and along the way s still real early thus far can work to build that teamwork and strengthen mutual goals and build each other as a team and continue to grow and deepen the relationship and love and support each other .
in the meantime at only '' two months do n't sweat it too much ... that 's relatively early in a relationship .
he 's very good but i ca n't figure out how pospisil always manages to lose
there are many new styles of replica designer belts on https www.brdshowplaza.ru they are high quality welcome to do business !
just spent the last bit online and decided to hell with it .
i sold my barrett over the weekend and i 'm buying a grail watch .
hopefully my wife does n't bury my ass wearing it .
i think a big crash is coming pretty soon .
hindsight is 20/20 but you made the right call selling when you did .
body glide sounds it is for something dirty but it has been a huge help for board/wetsuit or really any rashes .
prevents rash from happening and makes it go away if i forget to put it on .
not many nintendo games let you bring up a console .
do n't know what it stands for but it 's the rep boost that 's closest to retail
you 'll be fine you probably would n't be the only one in your graduating class that would n't know how to march .
if its anything like a b1g school considering they pac 12 is the b1g of the west i 'm sure it is it 's not unusual .
if you can know the music and have a positive attitude while you may not get a marchings spot and only serve as an alternate freshman year you have a good chance of making the cut .
oh wow now that you say that i would n't mind some of that yuri ...
i really do n't know but i wo n't be there when that happens
it 's kinda like al-jazeera it might be good journalism if it does n't have any tangible relation to the national interest of russia
still very new to mixing vocals so tell me how it sounds and what i can do to improve the quality of my mix !
lol was more of a personal joke about girls loving animal crossing .
this flag represents that the empire is n't as bad as it seems .
the red stripe represents a light-saber and the two-tone logo shows light and dark in the empire .
do i think that excusing that video as locker talk and still supporting him is what most republicans did ?
there is an inherent difference between supporting someone and supporting the actions that they do .
while there may be some people who ca n't handle the cognitive dissonance and try to convince themselves that the grabbing pussies '' thing was not bad most people i would argue think that is bad but still support him in spite of that .
many democrats supported al franken until they realized that moore was going to lose in alabama and then they could drop franken without worrying about losing a seat and then they could gain the high ground .
the entire democratic party stood behind bill clinton someone who is a repeat offender of sexual misconduct .
they supported him literally up until 2017 when they could get the moral high ground by dumping him off their platform .
does that mean i think all democrats support sexual misconduct or view it as locker room behavior '' ?
every fucking week some long time lurker pops out protecting jewish bs .

stupid panderers put themselves between a rock and a hard place .

you right i mean just get a ferrari smh s
conversion does n't prevent the added as '' from sourcing the original pre-conversion base damage .
i will be making a video of tortuga in it 's prime from footage i have taken a few weeks before it 's end ... this is a photo of my ship the cresslin sitting in the water ready to set sail into that blue horizon .
no render distance can not be tweaked even on pc .
beyond 500m the animal ai becomes dumb '' to save on processing .
the animal render distance is capped to hide this .
the s is for small '' was a recurring joke actually haha .
i was trying to rush this video out on friday afternoon damn day job so i actually did not refine the audio as much .
like even the background music is a bit lout actually also i 'm just quiet in general .
the p3 's name is the one i disagree with the most honestly .
i think that yu narakami is a much better name than souji seta .
i 'm also coming around to ren amamiya and liking it more and more .
but for p3 ... makoto yuki just sounds like such a dull-ass name .
there is a town in oklahomanwhere you can see many of the old sears catalog homes .
why does it pop into existence already travelling that speed and why is the speed what it is ?
i.e. why not a faster or slower speed for the speed of light ?
in all seriousness though i love anchorage and i do n't think i 'd trade it for any city in the world .
there 's a lot going on you just have to look !
yeah suprised when he did that especially with all the abuse we gave him
the flag of the mighty starkiller base is graced by a striking emblem that takes inspiration from the emblem https vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/46/first_order.svg of the glorious first order .
the flag symbolizes strength and power and depicts the main weapon firing its energy beams across the vast reaches of space sending them tearing through hyperspace in order to destroy the treasonous new republic !
see it on flagwaver http krikienoid.github.io/flagwaver ? src=https 3a 2f 2fi.imgur.com 2flxswdvk.png
did the people allow them to rule through fear sort of thinking they had no other choice since they could n't beat them supposedly or did they actually like the silver lords and felt a sense of betrayal when they found out they were lying about their immortality .
luka shows up outside of the water near the end of season 1 when everyone is praying to get rain free from the void and to kill the chaotic darkness .
the totw 14 and 15 code was there weeks beforehand .
even if the totw sbc did n't come out until the weekend there 's gon na be one it 's the only way for ea to balance the market it would be in the code already .
unless ea have realised everyone checks this code and is hiding it from us so they can drop it without people knowing its coming .
people have n't been able to predict every pack from sbcs that is coming from the code so they obviously know how to implement an sbc without revealing the pack reward in the code
it 's probably the most popular dim sum place in boston and there 's nothing online about any health code violations .
why would anyone call themself the mordern day warrior '' ?
yeah mike evans has been the most consistent offensive player we 've had in years .

nyx is a support offlaner that offers teamfight control .
he has one of the highest base hp regen give him 2 mangoes and he becomes a walking tango
max manaburn does 5*int damage on a 4 sec cd .
he absolutely destroys heroes like od medusa and tinker .
carapace is a counter to burst and anything aoe especially channeling spells like blackhole and freezing field .
vendetta is used early on as a ganking burst tool later on its more for scouting and positioning .
it gives nyx insane range and low cd on impale .
boosts your hp and mana regen so you can keep fighting
give him aghs octarine core and you 'll be unkillable by anything less than a 3 man gank .
honestly roaming dagon nyx is useless in this case bh riki and lion are better .
your job is to stand in the middle of a teamfight stun mobile heroes mana burn high int heroes mana dependent heroes and use carapace to stun and return aoe spells .
i feel nostalgic for 1990s and 2000s entertainment and media .

i work as a colorist on different reality shows but i also use the color wheel to help decide what to wear on most days .
if i know what colors look good together and i want to look good boom that 's a very large part of dressing well .
other fighting games have had closed betas with problems similar to this and were nearly perfect on launch .
josh has played well lately this looks like the player he is supposed to be
he 's no longer the worst rookie in the league in my opinion .
i 'm hoping the first half of the season was just a weird fluke for all the young players frankly .
would be great if everyone ulis and bender next can get a sit down with triano .
it depends on how much wood grain you want to show through .
you can use a darker stain or gel stain for a more opaque look .

even if i do n't win the war it 's the easiest way to have a cool adventure .
i might choose the spellbook if i knew i could do more with it than heal and attack people .
i think a greater issue is wow is too quick to either kill off or afraid to develop good villains .
wrath hinted at a redemptive arc for arthas with us exploring his soul 's innocence in the cave beneath icecrown nothing came of it .
while there 's something to be said for a force-of-nature villain it think it resulted in the most scattered and poorly rendered expansion story .
shame is concept art showed a human form of him which we never got to interact with .
garrosh had the potential to be a good villain .
the embodiment of the cycle of hatred with a huge legacy on his shoulders they did a pretty good job rendering him in cata .
mop threw that away for an old god corruption story which was a shame .
i think warlords had a really great story which makes it a shame they decided not to tell it .
introduced six potentially intriguing complex villains only to kill them off in 5-mans and as lesser raid bosses with little in the way of context or progression .
gul'dan even into this expansion felt like an extended reminder to people to go see the warcraft movie .
i think the illidan issue is fascinating because of the gap .
i wonder if he 'd been a presence all these years if people would still have an issue with the secretly the world savior '' arc for him .
but the running theme through all of this is that none of these characters last outside their '' expansions .
blizzard needs to let some of these characters grow and breathe something i hope they take to heart with sylvanas and anduin who seem to be the big faces behind bfa until the inevitable n'zoth appearance

if you think that bigger blocks leading to centralization from your node 's point of view is bad then i assume you are potentially in favor of a block size decrease .
surely 1mb is n't some magic number that 's perfectly decentralized .
if you think 1mb is decentralized enough then it 's not hard to imagine the tradeoffs for 2mb or 4mb .
there are millions of people who ca n't afford to run a 1mb node .
should we cater to them and decrease the block size ?
it 's not easy question but whatever it is 1mb is not the exact number .

as with all of these guys coming back i just hope he can get thought the season without getting hurt .
rb is such an injury prone position that i 'd worry about that .
he 's been huge for their offense for years now .
more like 1k in story boss rush events etc .
every single stone on this account was used for inventory increase
for that price i do n't think it 's really a gen 1 .
for a gen 2 which it probably is that 's ok .
the easiest way to tell is to look at the frame .
gen 1 has a grip texture that wraps all the way around where the gen 2 just has the texture on the sides and checkering on the front and back .
yep edmunds only values the 1996 v8 gt at 2.5k and this sixten sabre '' is based on the v6 auto .

he 's shoved some pretty insane spring loads into the sharpfire i think as high as 18kg which can be converted a sealed brass breach .

out of curiosity what are you doing that you want to be able to eq and ord for floats
the orders have to be sorted based on price then time of entry .
i could probably use some fixed point arithmetic but decimals are more natural .
and for matching prices i have to do equal .
i was aware of issues with float but i am hoping that decimal will be better for a reasonable precision .

sound have been cooler if they announced by having it retrace the scene in the movie .
having that slide around san fran would have been awesome
hats off for all you have done your whole life .
he seemed to be doing it alot during the last set .
also watching isner is unnerving ... in my mind i can see his leg snapping in half every time he goes in the air .
were the two people who led him away from the scene in on it too ?
i mean support wise he definitely should n't have it .
the boot camp is good for going over the topics with someone who knows it .
it does n't give you a fast lane to read and digest the content .

there seems to be a fundamental disconnect in your brain that prevents you from understanding how situations compare with each other .
as i understand it the ranks in garena are not the equivalent of the large servers such as euw and na due to server population .
i have a couple of friends that play on garena and na .
they all said that na players are much better but by how much they could n't specify .
just that they had a much difficult time achieving comparable ranks on na than garena .
i have other friends that play on lan and na .
they said that na gold players noticeably better than lan gold players but that might be due to the population of the server .

how does being a leaver mean his answer ca n't be europe ?
idk we like to complain and for the conqs running bash even when he gets it of and heavies you get a free gb afterwards .
probably just frustration that the best characters are assassins and poor shin just gets caught in the hate wagon even though he is far from the worst to fight even if he is unwinnable for certain characters yet the same can be said for conq
what kind of adjustment to shields do you think would be appropriate to give them a buff ? ''
for mace/hammer shield an attack speed buff would be good i guess .
for sword shield the light attack should hit 4 targets as the 1h sword does with the headshot modifier staying the same shield 1 1h x2 .
for axe shield maybe attack speed buff on light attack .
no thanks that sounds awful rengar should not have any focus on ap and an adaptive bonetooth does n't fix the problem with bonetooth all .
that is for anakin and padme i know reborn theory and funnily enough they played it for kelly at her introduction as rose at swc .

we think my uncle committed suicide by jumping into the river shannon in ireland .
i tried to kill myself when i was 16 and it 's bringing back all those dark memories and feelings i thought i left behind me long ago .
this is n't about me and i hate feeling like this .
i do n't want to say anything because we should be worried about my nan and dad not me !

this is what i think of every time i see a cuttlefish .
this annoys me way more than people drawing at the start of their turn .
steps and phases are n't something you respond to .
also if you do n't have any upkeep triggers or you do n't want to do anything in your upkeep and your opponent is tapped out drawing and untapping in an incorrect order just does n't matter and probably saves time .
it 's on you to announce to your opponent that you have an effect on their upkeep .
if you do n't think they gave you a chance to do so by drawing right away call a judge .
that has han offline encrypted vault file and optional cloud sync .
there are vulnerabilities but in terms of convenience it is the easiest and most secure way .
if you are worried about keyloggers you can use two pc 's .
one online to sync the files back-up security and the other offline one to open the vault and using an encrypted usb stick to transfer the vault file between pc 's to keep the offline and online versions in sync .
or use a hardware wallet like ledger s to store the addressess .
da căcatul ăla de analiza de risc e obligatoriu .
partea și mai perversa e că dacă ai incidente analiza se reface pentru a remedia problemele .
pe de altă parte nu are nici o valoare pentru că nu e avizată de igpr dar igpr nu îți dă plan de pază și plan de instalare fara analiza de risc .
yeah of course i agree for icx but i would like to see more coins from their market .
i did n't know ven was korean as their are based in singapour .
if you use filter media and some plants/decorations from your other tank you 'll be fine .
just do n't add a ton of shrimp all at once .
the one thing you do need to worry about is that the new tank wo n't have an established biofilm for the shrimp to graze on .
that 's why it 's a good idea to add some plants/wood/decorations from a established tank .
or just make sure you give them some food .
just a small amount though they do n't eat a lot .
seems to me very low self esteem and a massive grudge against us normal folk doesnt it ?
bitfinex charged 0.5 btc for the iota withdrawal ticket id 862797 .
there are some people having the same problem with different types of coins .
bitfinex has replied some of them that they are colleting the all affectig users and will be credited back .
i think the payment will be done as btc .
if there was a settlement in other coins if you didi n't have 0.5 btc in your wallet credited back will not be done in other coins .
please take a look at their request hub https blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-december-22nd-2017-first-feedbacks-colossus-introducing-request-51fc3387a686 and the mindmap https www.mindmeister.com/995302918 ? t=y78cucvprn .
request is n't designed to have the request team build every segment there are enough incentives to have third parties develop on top of request .
i have worked at the hospital where i will deliver for 15 years and have never been a patient myself so i am actually curious what our patient food tastes like in comparison to the cafeteria food !
that being said i already told my husband the first thing i want is a big-ass turkey sub from my favorite place .
but that 's not what op 's point was about .
so maybe they should stop running and fix their countries .
240 years ago a bunch of colonists stood up against the british empire and won .
it can be done easily imo rework watcher gift .
watcher gift need to evolve to get more xp and gold from the jungle 's creeps .
to evolve you need to get assists from x minions from the lanes .
then you force the support to stick to a lane early and mid game .
supp ll get bonus end of mid-game/early late game .
make the bonus good then they are not far behind .
then you push the game in the direction you want early-mid supp in lanes .
hey op if you are based in bangalore we are happy to meet you let us know via a dm .
let 's not pretend he 's just wheeled out for minor stuff .
i think a lot of gear obsession is as somebody said because it is a way of thinking about hiking when you are stuck in the office for months .
1 i should check but i think it does and i know it works for extraction talisman tengen kujaku .
2 good question that situation does n't occur much in pve but i think it does n't .
i 've seen the hits at the end of the combo double in damage or more .
7 onmyo magic power increases elemental damage and that scales up status infliction in my experience
some still play zul'jin and valla marksman build against arthas and johanna this doesnt let the game meta evolve and stabilize .
this is a talent choice issue not a role/class issue imo
moving to binance is n't the same as selling to binance .
just like she 's an adult who can make informed decisions so are you .
you do n't have to do everything she asks for especially if you have concerns about it .
i mean i liked the ending all the same .
if i see it 's not possible i can take a step back
they destroy crops massive risk when driving country roads especially at dusk hell i 've hit one in a pretty built up area etc .
but they 're an iconic animal that tourists are often stoked to see .
g9x maybe a few hundred dollars since it 's new .
check craigslist and ebay to see what other people are charging for their used cameras .
then if you sell charge a price slightly lower than the lowest price already online .
there is a limit to how cool a heavy blinket will get or vice versa .
there is no need to print pretty bits of paper .
just store them in a text file and print a copy to stash in the safe with your usb backup .
mate about 10 caps 20 kills 10 15 defends while bringing in kill streak rewards and match bonus around 4000 is quite easy to get .
makes sense did n't think about that as i have n't really payed attention to that part of the german tree .
i can make a blanket judgement because there is no way that a country-wide doomsday missile warning should be able to be executed by the mistake of a single person
the same reason a nuclear missile ca n't be launched by a single person
a proper system must protect against it not more training for an individual
humourously that posthumous relationship allowed leon to keep his humours inside .
getting shitface drunk saved leon from dying because it made him late to work .
so he was n't there when everyone else died .
my grandfather took me out on his property once and showed me this heap of copper and metal on the bottom of this steep hill .
well once when he was way younger he was out there working '' and heard a car pulling up so he just kicked the whole operation down the hill out of fear .
started a small fire and when a voice asked him what was wrong he yelled out just cooking my dinner '' but when he turned around it was just his cousin who had come back from out of town .
yeah ca n't really act as a currency with each unit being 150 dollars and is non-divisible .
i think neo is a great piece of tech .
russia is perhaps the only country you can not reason with .
it 's much easier to negotiate with saudi arabia than with russia .
and importing saudi gas would weaken russia 's position in europe as you are surly aware .
a lot of these crime families have high ranking contacts in these organizations working for them .
this vikings fan is humbled by their kicker 's performance in this game .
although slightly different to your situation i do varying rep ranges each week and have been progressing solidly for the past two months even on a cut .
i 'm currently running a 6 day ppl split with the first three being power and the second three being hypertrophy .
i hit 6/8/10/12 rep ranges across the 6 days .
i was running phul for about 10 months but by the end i got quite bored of it .
now i use the power/hypertrophy principal from that but applied to ppl .
i 'm currently hitting/exceeding all my pbs from when i was bulking during phul across both power and hypertrophy days even on a cut .
i 've been adding weight each week to almost all exercises and when i plateau i 'm just going to increase volume for 4 weeks then drop reps/sets back down and increase intensity again .
also statistically jimmy is slightly better at isos both defensively and offensively .
the way the coach and the qb just sit there in disbelief .
culber mentioned in last weeks episode that his arms and legs were shortened suggesting they were shortened to be human length as opposed to klingon length .
! thanks although i doubt silva will have anything to do with sane 's playing time .
the lack of a natural lb in city 's squad is the only cause of concern right now as there 's nobody to support him .
danilo is pretty shite and he seems a little isolated most of the time .
hence the mahrez idea as mahrez looks to be pretty much the biggest attacking threat in puel 's leicester side and is in serious form .
having an easy run of fixtures till the end of the season will also probably help him .
nevertheless i think keeping sane would be the better option right now .
will look at him against newcastle before making any decision .
i 'm supposed to change my contacts every month .
for the past 7 years i 've changed them only once a year .
i am a ginger and many asian tourists have asked to take pics with me cuz of it .
are you going on an african safari or a trip to grandma 's house ?
the best answer is kronos ptr u can add gear but its empty so no pvp
the thing is as well that interpretation of her in my opinion just is n't very attractive.. at all .
the mod somehow gives sera a plastic appearance and the proportions of her face seem really off .
though it needs to be said that i 'm lukewarm on cosmetics mods across the board .
i do n't use them at all in da i and in origins i prefer those that remain fairly close to lore .
i avoid cosmetics mods that make npcs look like they 've just stepped out of a tawdry la salon .
when shaly was talking about when they 'll re-release nier event i thought she was doing the money throw .
i can understand the reasoning for those things but it still seems the issue is out of proportion and irrational like anxiety often is .
i 'm not even old by any means and i never encountered this before .
i shower at home after gym but i live next door and my shower is better than theirs at the previous gym i showered as normal .
i live in a country where we grew up with naked family saunas and mixed gender naked saunas are not completely rare either .
thing is.. he is not autistic.. have you have encountered anyone with autism for significant amounts of time .
my father works with disabled people including down syndromes and autistic ones .
maybe they do/dont have things like empathy compassion etc .
but they do n't pick and choose when they can show/have them and certainly do n't pick and choose when to use it for their benefit and when to not to look like they 're disabled .
ee is a fully functioning human being you can tell by his behaviour reactions how he speak minus that weird mumbling .
what does this say it says that ee is just human .
he is n't an evil overlord he has friends prolly treat people nicely most times .
but humans are flawed have ambitions have bad habits bad traits .
thing is if he like say if people do this to me it 's fine i do n't complain .
he can do it like this for his team/career .
but you see it before when he is treated unfairly he went to blog mode .
but then he get so tunnel vision when he needs to do harsh decisions
huh i no longer feel bad about the ones i 've nicked .
all my security staff was gone and materials pretty much gone too .
i do n't have the time to grind for hundreds of soldiers in a day man lol i work
why the fuck does your rda have a troll face on it lmao .
wish they would test the pc servers while they are at it ... .
the giant unstated truth of american politics of the last decade is the staggering insane levels of bad faith that republicans have shown in federal governance
the nine most terrifying words in the english language are 'i 'm from the government and i 'm here to help . ' ''
i agree with you that kaze should still be a nice guy based on the new timeline .
it could be that he 's being threatened for some reason ?
op probably not banned rather i 've seen this when i was reporting a bot who just got banned
now i 'm hungry and considering a tuna bake at 1:35am .
but then i doubt that you will reach more than 140 spd with that
they are n't going to get it if it spawns behind the dps group .
i was not defending the pyro it was more of a jab at general hate that all classes get .
which also applies to pyro even though it 's brokenness before the ji made him less effective and current problems make her more effective .
once you have the rocket mated on the tel its kinda hard to take it out and put another rocket on it .
on heavy it is basically impossible without demating everything and trucking out some boosters to make room .
not something you 'd do unless you know the launch is not going to happen anytime soon .
it would be if it had bullseye and would do damage every time you draw a card
headstone carver feeds charge meter ... .1 attack creatures without bullseye are bad
im not sure how they have proven being secure .
if not being hacked yet is proof of security then we 're in big trouble .
everytime i see someone talking like you about their trauma it shows me i may not be normal as i thought .
when they broke in they tied my father up .
my mother tried to fight and she was overpowered .
they proceeded to put us face down and put a gun on my head .
this was exciting to me after the whole ordeal .
then i saw my mother balling and heard how my father cried at work .
i preceded to act like those guys and in a weird way got off on what they did thankfully i grew out of it .
i was easily going in the way of a criminal and thankfully my life was altered .
i had though suffered a lot as a child and maybe this is why i never had that much emotional impact from the event .
i have found the is no way to make things better after such events other than not letting these thugs take life from us .
as long as we live we ca n't give our life to them and their actions .
their actions made me a little wiser as i have two big dogs and read videos of professional house breakers .
what their actions wo n't do is make me live life a little shorter than i would have .
while i never eat the stuff anymore the smell of popcorn immediately makes me think of going to the movies but i can totally understand why someone would hate it .
have retails for nmd r1s r1 pks ultra boosts and yeezy v2s .
eqt is super cushiony and boost is pree thicc .
the chunk missing from mjollnir is really an eyesore .
well if you do n't have any other argument then you can gladly clean the warlock hall ...
i 'm leaning towards athena though because 30 damage cut refresh is invaluable and you can stick her into all of your parties in place of carbuncles
thanks a lot for your help really nice protests pictures by the way particularly the one with the hair of the police woman nice contrast !
thanks man that did solve a lot of my issues .
when u are playing u don '' t understand but when u see from another perspective u get your shortcomings .
in 2020 i will be a rich institutional money guy .
yeah like why do n't you share the audio ?
instead i 'm supposed to believe a known pos like dick durbin .
once again the context was the bleeding hearts at the meeting pleading for lottery immigration from shit hole countries after the geotus has made it clear since nyc bangadleshi terrorist incident that lottery immigration is non-negotiable .
people who push people 's buttons can get reactions which out of context are over the top and in context are quite reasonable .
norwegians are more skilled more educated have values more consistent with americanism have more money are less likely to be a drain on the federal coffers are more likely to add to the federal coffers .
and btw no one has accused the geotus of advocating for lottery immigration from non-shitholes .

80 games deep into this experiment and i can actually say the momentum turns your way later on in the game .
i ended up winning about 30 more games when i did this .
and that 's even with starting down a goal .
i even noticed sometimes if i score 2 own goals about 40 mins into the game i can probably score 3 within 5 minutes at some point .
i do n't think fifa is about being better then your opponent but about knowing the scripting more then your opponent .
do n't bother with it unless they patch it which they wo n't .
bad enough that rivers is n't there or that garoppolo is even listed but just a reminder that you can disregard anybody 's list if wilson is n't 5 4 .
even worse when a qb ahead of him has n't played in over a year luck and another ca n't even match his first two seasons wentz .
five consecutive playoffs two sbs a ring all winning seasons etc is n't good enough .
just found this sub and i think this should be a fun contribution .
edit the customer was n't really irate but it still seems fitting .
let me know if it belongs in a different sub i have n't discovered yet .
my birthday is october 30th so i 'm pretty partied out from the evening before .
but there 's a costume contest at my favorite bar and i wanted to go .
knowing that getting an uber there and back would cost a small fortune and that i did n't want to get drunk i drove myself there .
around 1am some folks decided it was time for a late night meal .
at the time i was the proud owner of a p71 crown vic retired police car .
i 'm waiting at a red light downtown my windows are rolled down i 'm smoking a cigarette and my music is blaring .
out of the corner of my eye i see a group of four people walking towards my car .
by the time i realize what 's happening it 's too late to lock my doors and they all pile in .
girl hops shotgun yammering drunk on her phone while three more pile in the back .
drunk girl dg yeah okay i know this is an uber.
dg yeah just take us home. she then proceeds to recount the evening with folks in the back .
i make a left when they were expecting a right and things start to click .
i told you i 'm not an uber driver .
dg proceeds to check the app and notice that stephanie in a black prius already canceled the pickup .
i 'm a 225 pound bald man with a massive beard dressed like billy mays in a white police car .
i park and get out of the car and proceed to open the back doors for the folks in the back never got the doors fixed glad it never was a safety issue .
me you 're welcome to come in and join us for breakfast !
dg and the gang declined and i left them in the parking lot while they presumably waited for a new uber .
for oneplus 5t kernel sources were released on the day of the presentation of the smartphone .
do you think lg will consider that this might be one of the reasons oneplus is liked despite their truly shitty customer service now that lg phones match oneplus on pricing a few months after release .
been lurking for a couple months now and decided to take a plunge and buy a bike.i have been on the hunt to buy a hardtail for commuting 5 miles of slight off road and cycle paths .
i 'm struggling to find something for under £600 that fits the shoe .
i have no knowledge or cycle bike parts therefore i do not know what is good or not .
the best mtb i believe i could get would be a specialized pitch comp would this be wise ?
i am hoping someone educate me and any advise would be awesome about starting off .
i recently got a kenyan sand boa at a reptile expo .
she is about 6 inches long and i 'm pretty sure she is over 6 weeks old and under a year .
as well i got her about 2 days ago .
i was planning on waiting 5-7 days for her first feed so she can get settled is this a good idea ?
also i heard someone say it is a good idea to feed them in some place that isnt their enclosure because they may expect food whenever you reach your hand in their enclosure and bite you .
if so what is another good place to feed ?
i have recently taken an interest in makeup and i was wondering if wearing lipgloss or lipstick would damage my tuba ?

i just want to send my deepest apology to fred murray and the murray family for comments i made online recently .
after doing research and reading many articles i was able to uncover something that 's been hidden for many years .
i will release a podcast tomorrow with more information .
to make sure you do n't spoil anything sensitive !
i joined this fellowship group and they 're very strong in the faith .
it 's awesome to be challenged and to grow .
they 're connected to a local church which did a christians and culture sermon series .
the verdict was n't good to the point of serious depression for a week after each .
i started out greatly enjoying my time with the other members .
i ca n't let my guard down and be close to any of them .
i live a double life active in the campus lgbt center and in weekly bible study .
now that i 'm starting to explore romance i feel even more alienated .
the only reason i have n't left is feeling like i 'd be a bad christian .
i 've been brought up to think that only conservative churches were rigorous and biblical and leaving because i do n't like their stance feels as though i 'm walking away from god .
we bought superbowl tickets last night after the minneapolis miracle and after talking today decided we were going all the way in .
we just booked travel to the nfc championship game !
i will be wearing vikings gear and cheering on our beloved purple and gold from enemy territory .
i hope the eagles fans appreciate football and a good game and are n't too hard on us .
hopefully there is a decent showing of purple jerseys at the game !
i 'm thinking of starting to swim but i have some things that are stopping me .
i have n't really been formally taught how to swim apart from some lessons in my high school gym class .
i do n't know how to tread water and i 've never actually swam in deep end before do n't know if i 'll sink or swim .
i 'm taking master 's classes at the university that i would be practicing at so i would only be able to practice for about 3 hours a week .
i do n't really know what a good time is for some of the standard swims 50 free etc .
so i do n't really know what good times are to measure my performance .
my school says that the pool is a competitive swimming pool '' but i do n't know what the depth is .
i 'm kind of nervous about looking like a newbie in front of elite swimmers who have been doing this for years .
i would only be practicing during open swimming hours .
i know all the strokes but i 'll say i 'm pretty bad at them .
i want to take a class on how to float in water sometime soon but school keeps getting in the way .
i probably will in the summer when i 'm not taking classes .
i was thinking i would practice the strokes for now and then learn some more stuff over the summer ?
visiting iceland with my dad in late feb early march .

i know swiping left from the edge shows the side bar and swiping right from the edge go to the previous screen but can the swipe start inside the screen ?
we have a dog who just underwent bilateral knee surgery .
ten days afterwards today we noticed significant swelling of one of the knees .
we have had him restricted him the crate or a small room and take him outside to use the bathroom .
we called the vet but they just want to take xrays tomorrow .
i 'm worried he will need another surgery and that 's something we ca n't really afford it after the bilateral surgery earlier .
just looking to see what possible outcomes may be .
just worried we may have to go through the process again and be out 2,500 after already moving the budget around significantly for the first one .
does anyone know if this is an indication of the surgery failing ?
the last image is what the other knee looks like that has n't been swollen yet .

i 'm about to pull the trigger on this build .
i 'm extremely happy with it given the amount of time and research that i 've put into it .
so my question for you guys is how does it look ?
i 'm hoping for this to be gaming pc with the future possibility for alittle vr action and maybe some 4k .
have been browsing this board this weekend and as a traffic engineer i 'm curious to hear thoughts from people on this subject .
obviously at this point here in the us there are still limitations that affect the profession such as having to hold to standards such as level of service/delay and trip generation often dictated by people who ultimately make decisions for dots and cities so some of that is outside my control as an entry level traffic engineer .
but outside of that what is one thing small or big we can we do to help create a better future for our cities ?
maybe prioritizing certain intersection/roadway designs over others for example ?
i got so excited because i was so good while she was gone i expected tendies immediately .
rushing upstairs at a breaking neck 5 minute mark i accidently shit myself .
mummy mummy tendie time tendie time ! i cry out as the door closes .
sweating heavily and stinking of love i stare at mummy .
her hair is gone the remainder shaved from her well earned scalping from her promise breaking .
her left arm is in a cast and she walks with a limp thanks to her bad driving .
her eyes cast down were wet with tears of joy from seeing her good boy recovering from his booboo .
mummy give my booboo a kiss it hurts so bad !
i need changies and tendies and a blowey joey and access to my playroom and tendies and choccy milk and tendies and ... she walks past me to her bedroom .
mummy what are you ... ? i ask as she shuts the door .
my arsenal shall serve me and she will acknowledge her little tyke and make up for the last two days of neglect .
i return to my lair kiss my waifu astolfo dakimakura and put on my karate kid headband .
i gather my piss jugs and my bucket of you-ate-too-fast-goddammit tendie vommie or at least that is what mommy keeps saying .
i keep in case i need food for later .
i make my way to the crawl space above mommy 's room .
it 's a tight fit but i manage to get everything up there and climb up like the coolest monkey in the jungle .
i pry through the pink cotton candy that mommy hid up there .
i just my nippon steel to pierce the ceiling .
part of the blade chipped this house was obviously built by ‘muricans using superior ww2 materials .
there is a hole in the ceiling i peak through .
she has ear plugs in and a bottle of adult sippy sip bottles riddle the floor of her bedroom .
i begin removing the caps of the bottles and setting them all around the hole .
i grab the bucket and stepping carefully into the pentagram i have formed with my piss and shit i begin to jump on the weakened hole reeeing loudly .
i fall through along with a cascade of my revenge .
i land directly on mommy 's leg with a wet snap .
her eyes are closed her mouth wide her scream piercing .
i ball my hand around the diaper and rocket it into her mouth .
i pulling out my pants tendie and begin my tendie splendie .

i assume you 've heard taxation is theft '' and i also imagine you dismissed it as rumbling .
i believe for that argument to have any emotional punch you need to not believe in the current system to the same degree i do fuck all '' which some percentage of the population will do but is a massively minority position .
my political movement is a dank may-may to many it hardly worth whatever public awareness that the downplay got .
i think there are two massive flaws that come from this
democracy failed the last political cycle trump v hillary and what the fuck happened in britain and it was n't public knowledge that there are arguments that hate this system predicting the future is knowledge .
if it was big and public like the taxation is theft '' meme the fact it happened would lend extreme credibility
the little pet project known as bitcoin maybe you 've heard of it .
implemented a form of democracy last year and it was a complete failure delaying an network update for a year .

first i tried to put in the .2 ohm coil but something must have been wrong with it because it said atomizer short '' no matter what i did so i threw it out and tried the .5 ohm instead .
but the flavor is n't really good i almost ca n't taste anything actually .
could it be because i tighten the coil too much or could it be another reason ?
normally i vape triton .4 ohm at around 25 watts .
with the new stm coil .5 ohm i put it at 55 to begin with but i did n't really like that since i normally go for flavor and do n't like hot hits so i put it down to 37 watts .
but did n't really make any difference on the flavor still very mute .

so when the yalu jailbreak came out i downloaded it and everything was fine .
i then accidentally deleted a tweak that was needed for cydia and cydia and all my other apps from cydia disappeared .
so i restored to ios 10.3.1 about a year ago .
now that g0blin is out i downloaded it and hit jailbreak '' .
when i rebooted the device there was still no cydia .
i have to open cydia by going into safari and typing in the search box cydia '' .
everything works fine but when i download cydia apps like filza they wo n't show up and i 'll have to open them through safari like this filza '' .
can someone please help me bring back my cydia and cydia apps ?

hi there tech community ! i 've an issue i was hoping you guys could help me with.lately i 've been receiving these random blue screens of deaths on my computer both while running windows 8.1 and after i factory resetted it and upgraded it to windows 10.the error message displayed differs from time to time the ones i 've come across so far are critical_procces_died-kernel_data_inpage_error-unexpected_store_exception
the screen freezes as if it 's stuck on loading/processing the current application and then suddenly throws the blue screen .
what i 've tried so far to resolve the issue
i 've run a chkdsk/f/r which ran fine but afterwards i still received the same blue screens of death.therefore i decided to run the windows memory diagnostics tool of which i can not consult the results as for some reason windows decided not to log them .
and sadly enough i was n't around when he rebooted so i could n't check the popup message that should pop up after restart indicating the results of the test.anyways after this test i still received the blue screens around three times.what i know so far is that these blue screens are most likely caused by faulty hardware and that either being my hard drive or my ram memory and in a rare case perhaps my motherboard ? .
the problem is i 'm not sure which one of them is the culprit and i would like to know that with certainty so that i can go and buy myself a new hdd or ram sticks.but i do n't want to end up with a newly bought hdd only to find out it was the ram that was faulty.therefore i 'm addressing this subreddit in the hopes you guys could help me.has any of you experienced something like this before or are they familiar with the errors thrown and could you say with certainty which component they could be ascribed to ? many thanks in advance ! my best regards santaher0
with the start of the new campaign our heroes are now back to being low-level scrubs .
before we hit level 3 i thought it 'd be fun to try and narrow down the subclasses for the characters who still have yet to reach them .
beauregard as a rather laid back and carefree spirit we 've seen her as it 's easy to guess that marisha will choose the drunken master tradition .
extra maneuverability in combat will help at these low levels where death is easy and heals are few .
the bonus proficiency in performance also just screams something marisha will enjoy .
fjord even though warlocks get their main subclass at level 1 they also get the benefit of a pseudo-subclass in the form of pacts at level 3 .
as a clearly melee-focused hexblade travis is sure to pick pact of the blade for the benefit of early magical weapons and strong invocations down the line .
the ability to have a 1 magical weapon thanks to the improved pact weapon invocation at such a low level is sure to push travis over .
mollymauk this character certainly is an enigma not to mention he 's paired with a rather unique class .
knowing taliesin 's love of gothic themes i initially thought profaned soul with fiend bonuses would be a great fit but it steps on the toes of the existing warlock .
instead i feel as though ghostslayer fits due to the benefit of radiant damage in a setting filled with undead .
that 's all i really have to go on .
nott as a goblin with an admitted itch '' that compels her to steal it first looked like sam would certainly make her a thief but we all know he does n't like to be predictable .
with an astonishing 3 intelligence and a wizard as a close friend i find it more believable to see our little gobbo be an arcane trickster .
yasha leave it to ashley to make such a shady character .
with so little known of yasha so far there 's a few possibilities but i have a stake in two .
as an aasimar tying her to celestials it 's possible that yasha will be a zealot using her connection to divine forces to fuel her rage .
or as the traveling carnival 's main form of security and prime candidate for party tank she could very well be an ancestral guardian focusing more on protecting her allies and singling out the dangerous threats from everyone else .
feel free to share any of your own ideas down below !
my friend got in a car crash and the doctor in the hospital told him he has a twisted skull .
elf 2 core team hippo/fairy or wiwa/elementalist all t3 5-6 sr hippos depending on core and 4 sr priests
kl 59 and about to break to 60 unlocked all 6 arts just started transcing those
for pets ... well mambo 5 and some others on the way there moon icy and tinky 3 hipp 2 and sleepy boom 2
what arts should i upgrade first derpt and put blunt to 36 according to magics guide i should focus on economy first but im reaching my 1700 glvl farly easy atm ... so should i get blunt up so i can push more medals or go full econ ?
i dont want to switch to much saving gems for sr and transcing .
i guess i should run ele/hippo and wiwa for faster runs .
is my supp line up fine or would it be better to tech in something different ?
should i focus my spirit highlands runs on getting some frags and advancing or go full advance spending 200-400 per day
context false is a planerscape term for a person who has apathy/hatred to all deities .
this is also applying to my last post about the elf cannibal .
my player want to play someone who would be stroked down by the gods for being ... well a little shithole who no one likes .
he did this by making a human that ate elves and only elves while living in a fey elf forest .
i was going to be nice and let him level up and get some magic items before i dropped a unbeatable elf deity on him but he 's not biting my adventure hooks .
he did however find and talk to the assassins '' of his character .
i made it very clear that these were not people to mess with .
feeling their power pulse off of them and uses magic without v s or m. and all he did was laugh .
the only thing that worked was casting fear which is cheating way to make a character scared in my opinion .
however once he left and talk to my temporary dm pc its leaving next session about the talk the character told him it was a divine entity and an evil one at that .
and my player had his character laugh and say that the gods were weak idiots .
he is a level 3 ranger with nothing other then starting equipment and shows no worry what so ever .
he is somehow trying to think of a way to kill and eat the god with no ones help and no magic or at least magic that can damage them or magic items .
is there a way to try and make the character worried and be more careful with what he 's doing so i can give him some stuff to help him have a fight that last more then one turn ?
or do i just give him his sweet release of death in the most boring way possible .
a shift in perspective for the most part but i find with any shift i am grasping at how to redefine myself .
ah yes clothes that should assist with new me .
so i load up the kids and my mother and head out to find the style that depicts who i am now ... or who i think i am .
the day i can shop strictly for me till my heart is content ... .and it is not content .
i did n't find much that would show the world or rather myself who this new person is .
i suppose the lesson learned is that with this shift in my life i will focus on growing and understanding my spirit the shopping spree will have to wait perhaps indefinitely ?
you know when critics call a performance a revelation ? ''
that 's what vaughan delivers from start to finish .
i 'm blown away by his gut-wrenching honesty and his command of the screen .
it 's a performance that people especially actors are going to be talking about for years to come .
the year 's other primary much-discussed male performances oldman franco do n't even come close .
we have n't seen the knights of ren yet .
i 'm thinking that they 're in hiding and can only be activated '' at the death of kylo .
that quick scene in the throne room gave us some insight into hux 's desire to kill kylo .
i think he might succeed somehow in ix thus activating '' tkor .
i 'm speculating that kylo goes pretty early in ix and that his plot will be with luke snoke in some other realm .
what do you think about kylo finding redemption by using his/rey 's force power and new training from luke to come back and help rey and her trainees take tkor down ?
do you think rey could project into this other plane if he were to die early on ?

i knew back when i saw first contact in the theatres back in high school that there would be fallout from the movie despite picard and crew trying to fix what the borg started .
then i was watching enterprise and finished regeneration in season 2 .
none of that would have happened if the borg and enterprise-e did n't go back in time .
this also helps explain why nobody heard of enterprise nx-01 in the other series prior because although picard 's timeline seems similar the whole issue on romulus in nemesis seemed to come out of nowhere really .
the ent finale with riker and troi in the holodeck going over enterprise 's final mission and such could also have been the effect of this new timeline where before nothing was ever mentioned during tng regarding the nx-01 .
enterprise leads to discovery which explains why the ships and tech seem more advanced than in tos
starts with tos tng ds9 halfway or so of voy then first contact starts the new timeline back to enterprise now discovery and then a whole new tos not yet seen ... .. to affected tng last bit of voyager around the year of hell perhaps where things could have gone wonky a bit without voy noticing ?
to insurrection nemesis then spock trying to save romulus results in the kelvin timeline .
obviously there have been many more through the shows but for the main timelines i used to think there were two but seems like there is three or am i missing something ?
i like playing ormarr as tank with this build at the moment https imgur.com/a/dpkbq

i am a 23 years old male from syria i left syria 3-4 years ago hoping for a better life now what happened there was really sad in short i lost most of my friends either died ran away never heard of them lost/died/kidnapped ?
and some of my family members so i decided to leave that hell place even tho i was n't really afraid of dying/didnt have alot of food/water/electricity/heat/etc.. i was enjoying my stay i was always whining about it but everyone was too so it was n't that big of an issue for me i lost my best friend because of the war he did n't want to leave his mother and go to lebanon and he had to go to the military anyways so he went before they forced him to make alittle bit of money he pretty much got unlucky usually people who get paid in the army tend to die first but there are alot of them and got sent to the front line in a battle and he died there it was shocking experiment for me i was more angry than sad honestly because of his decision but i let it go i had worse scenarios where i see people dying infront of because of car explosion or rocket but in syria people who are well tend to rush and help those people which leads to more death cause of more car explosions and i really wanted to leave the hell out of syria hoping for a better life .
i left syria really long story and went to belgium and there i thought i am going to be happy .
everything i wanted was there for me but all of that was just a big dream how fool was i when i thought of it now i can never return to syria i am stuck here no friends no family no job nothing really .
it was shocking to see how of a culture change it is the culture here is so different than what i am used to it is like almost nothing is the same syria had this huge extrovert society that you can speak really to anyone without saying hi even and not to be weird about it that place where friends and family meant really everything .
here i can feel the sadness of some people most of the people looking at their phones most of them are alone i see sometimes a person crying in the station and no one really cares i felt so disappointed that i got depressed about it
many people did n't want me to be here many people wanted me to leave or told me to kill my self even on the crowded streets someone tells me to look at the floor because i do n't deserve to look at them ?
i am not really an aggressive guy so i do n't really hit him in the face that 's a syrian attitude i know that i can call the police or whatever but really how does that change anything i am not going to feel good about putting someone behind a cell because he harassed me and the problem is bigger than him as a person so i kept going the more i go out the more bad attitude i receive the one that makes me sad the most are the people who just ignore me or just are afraid of me the one that changes the sidewalk to avoid me looking at them now before you get all upset about me criticizing your people i have met alot of nice people but i am sorry i am only but a human i ca n't just think about the good things .
i wanted to change alot stuff in my life but i never could here i am it has been almost 4 yearrs since i left syria and i keep dreaming about my home sometimes i would rather stay all day in my house rather than to go outside .
i decided to change alot of things such as going to university even there with alot of different nationalities i could n't make any friends i pushed my self to ask some girls out but who am i kidding there is a girl who is actually afraid of me in the college dorm but she wont say it.. going to the gym language courses etc .
nothing really worked out so i made this agreement i have never been sad or depressed this much in my life and it really surprises me that even at syria where there was nothing really i was happy even that i get mad alot of the times because of what is happening there i am still mad about what happened to my friend and is happening until now that if i do n't get any friends or anything better going on in my life for next 3 month or so ill probably going to end it i am really a guy who does n't believe that killing one self is beneficial maybe because i was born in a place where suicide ratio is slim ? and there is religion too but i would rather sleep than wake up to live this miserable life i usually sleep 12-16 hours in a free day .
this is probably the longest thing i have ever written in my entire life sorry if it not all of it makes sense and that 's the short version i should n't have probably left since i can never go back it was such an unreasonable decision i have heard alot of people leaving and wanting to comeback .
update i 'm sorry i did n't explain too much i said before that i ca n't go back to syria now my situation is alittle bit different than other syrians but even them they most likely ca n't go back atleast men who went in an illegal way .
there is something called forced military service when you are over 18 and most people mostly men it is male military service have to run it is not a joke and neither a place to mess around .
my problem tho is different i have already served 4 month of my service it is a 2 year but since we are at war its 6 years ?
and i got pretty unlucky i had no proper training neither the people i went out with long story short the things happening in the war are unbelievable they throw you to the middle of the enemies for money or just for no specific reason or the worse as scouts the thing that happened with my friend so i did n't just leave the country illegally but also i ran out of the army and the embassy of syria in belgium refuse even to renew your passport .
so probably most of the people who left syria by boats men specific can not go back to syria unless the president say something about it and it is possible that it wont happen .
people mentioned going to the us i heard you ca n't go to the us if you have a syrian nationality or canada i have heard the way people went to canada is by paying the church or someone to make a surety bond i do n't really know the name in english by paying them 15k .
i know i am depressed i never said otherwise thanks everyone for the advice sorry i was alittle bit late i had some exams and thank for the opinions even the people who hated me for writing this i do n't blame you and about that part when i said it is allowed in syria to hit a guy for yelling at you self defense and someone said i should go back for the thought of doing it i m sorry .

i grew up with a parent that smoked all the time in the living room bathroom etc .
excessive smoke was everywhere and said parent seemed to have no concern at all that it was affecting their child .
i once asked said parent why they smoked even though i could get cancer and even though i got teased for it said parent just said that they 're grown up and can do whatever they want .
i coughed a lot people were very mean to me in school teasing me for smelling like smoke etc .
my best friend smokes i do n't hate her i hate her smoking though and i 'd never date a woman or man that smoked .

douluo dalu 3 legend of the dragon king wuxiaworld 's hyperdimensional vampire http m.wuxiaworld.com/category/legend-of-the-dragon-king

sending anything to b shows up as to a on the recipient side .
this messes with some filtering rules i had planned on making

lmao the stuff they called this game and a guy literally uses both hands to rip matthews ' arm off the ball on the rebound and it does n't get called .

these doomfist bug posts are not gon na stop anytime soon .
doomfist introduces 3 more bugs almost every patch and i know that .
i also made these doomfist bug posts every now and then a couple of months ago my post never got the attention of a dev untill isinner made a thread about it .
im really glad the devs are fixing doomfist now ... but again ...
with 150 hour on this hero its pretty easy to tell when there 's a new bug introduced after a patch because you will feel a difference .
sometimes its harder to tell if its a bug or not but rather put it in the list and wait for a dev to confirm it .
anything that comes out of his mouth gives me that same feeling .
wikipedia is your best bet i think the cartoon where on earth is carmen sandiego is the source of a lot of it i do n't know how much of that stuff was in the older games .

someone was doing this to my grandmother for a while .
they never said rape but someone was calling her pretending to be me or one of my cousins and acting like they were in trouble .

freddy is still superhumanly tough and edward could be killed with a single bullet or a well timed punch from green arrow .
the problem is that the good reception has made it seem like some amazing marvel of cinema which is not something it was meant to be or even tried to be .
it 's just a long episode of the twilight zone or black mirror .

i find great comfort in contemplating suicide or my death in general .
it helps because i feel i have lost control over myself .
what better sense of control can one have in life but to end it of your own free will ?

try and watch a few episodes of raw smackdown and nxt which are mostly considered their own separate shows see what you enjoy the most .
do n't feel like you need to force yourself to watch everything my brother gets along fine watching highlight packages of raw and smackdown and then the events .
if i had to recommend one show as an introduction i 'd say watch nxt .
it 's a smaller roster of people it 's an easier watch and an hour long .
i 'm definitely aware the original cgi has n't aged well at all but the movie overall had a great mix of special effects to make everything feel alive .
the new stuff is obviously going to be technically better but it 's incredible dull and lifeless especially in a movie where everything is dull and lifeless .
thank you for wording this better than i or the rest of us that would be uncomfortable .

yoda 's fighting style ataru involves near-constant force usage to augment one 's physical capabilities in combat which made it the preferred form for jedi who needed to compensate for some kind of physical shortcoming such as age or small stature but the drawback was the constant force usage required made it unfeasible in prolonged combat .
so it would make sense that yoda would have more trouble than usual stopping a falling pole since he 'd just spent the last few minutes using the force non-stop .
thanks man haha i 'll make sure too not have the annoying controller clicking in the background next time lol

bit off topic but in regards to the armbar i have trained with coaches who stress never to cross your legs however i see many high level grapplers doing armbars with crossed legs
thanks i prefer this too for its higher contrast in the dress .
the other one was actually the first version i did for basic low contrast results but the final outcome was too bland for my taste so i made the background a bit stronger using tangerine purplish pink was considered instead of a neutral or more subdued cooler color blue or gray but toned it down as it was overwhelming .
it still results in about the same dark gray registration of the original when desaturated .
the syrian government 's best hope – as indeed russia and iran 's – would lie in weaning away the mainstream kurdish groups from the orbit of us influence to engage them constructively as participants in a peace process .
but turkey brands the kurdish groups as terrorists and threatens to attack them .
damascus has repeatedly questioned the turkish moves with regard to afrin .
going down the rabbit trail '' and exploring the philosophical and psychological purpose of humans while simultaneously evaluating existentialism is great .
i would even say its healthy and those that do n't ask any great questions of themselves and that of mankind are a let down to the next step in human evolution .
and the first thing anyone must accept when evaluating any aspect of the universe is that there are some truths we will never know .
and what iffing '' ourselves to death is a waste of emotional energy and an exasperation on our parts .
that being said let me amend myself one more time there are some personal truths that each individual knows without of shadow of a doubt .
and they know things about themselves more than they know and understand anything else in the world .
this type of awareness or truth '' as some call it goes beyond any conditioning because some truths are determined by reason and logic alone .
these truths can only be decided based on first hand experience of the tactile world .
for me i know without a shred of doubt it 's only an emotional reaction for me to long for my old community .
for one thing because everyone there is batshit crazy .
but because they literally do the exact opposite of what they preach .
if that 's not textbook stockholm 's syndrome i do n't what is !
reason logic and free thinking led me through the brainwashing emotional and physical coercion and abuse to realize that any party that demands i give up my free-will in order to become more holy '' and christ-like only to turn that will over to the community in order to be crucified weekly based on how i met or failed those standards that were in fact only set up by other humans .
that same reason logic and free thinking that allowed me to divorce myself from that community acts as a barometer known as my conscious .
my conscious tells me that my few good memories of growing up that usually surround the holidays are an innate reaction to a song on the radio that inspired joy in my preadolescents .
or compel a heart-warming awe '' out of me when i see the perfect nuclear family being displayed by a tlc family .
but i genuinely do not believe in the dogmatic truths of christianity .
i recognize that all religions teach humans through parables how to be better .
so even if there are some good things about something i do n't believe in i am not going to dismiss them .
but i am not going to sell myself to it either .
just because i like swimming and have great fond pool time memories as a kid does n't mean i have to can or should become an athletic swimmer .
look at the end of the day regardless of what i say or anyone else says if whatever is making you reminisce the religious influences in your life is substantial it will stick and anything else wo n't .
either way it 's ok to reminisce as long as you acknowledge that is what you are doing and you do n't lie to yourself about your intentions .
that will just bite you in the ass down the road .
like i know it 's meta but squad 1 just seems better
essentially this the area is fine its not the area you need to worry about its the people that frequent the area chatswood is a pretty big shopping and restaurant hub so a lot of people from outside the area do come and visit along with having a train station on the doorstep it does increase the possibility of someone knocking it off .

you 're not going to tell me that you never lied to your parents ?
the issue is that cbc ran with a story without checking any facts .
be upset at current cbc for picking up any news that will get clicks .
she 's a fucking kid who lied to not get in trouble with her parents if that 's not canadian then i do n't know what it is .
or are you going to tell me that your parents never caught you smoking ?
so you made up a bs lie to get away with it .
fuck cbc for running an article just to get clicks .

the only time i liked kyrgios is when he wore the f.trump tshirt .
tbh i 'm still fleshing them out myself but this is the gist of it .
the golems themselves are actually a single magical gem that operates like a heart and brain in one .
these gems sort of reach out with magic and posses for lack of a better term substances around them usually stone maybe always some sort of stone like i said still working on it .
another thing i 'm still trying to decide is if they feed by slowly absorbing the body into the core gem or if they have to eat some form of pure energy like fire .
either way they have a lot of control over what shape their body takes but they are still made of stone and do n't actually have vocal cords .
i 'll be honest i 'm not actually sure how they communicate yet .
i was thinking about sign language or maybe even manipulating their bodies to form words or make a deep slow rumbling voice with magic .
regardless they naturally congregate in areas with a lot of stone namely mountains and mines which also naturally puts them close to coal and gemstones .
therefore they naturally developed a talent for working with precious stones .
their main exports are jewelry and art like sculptures and mosaics .
i know how that feels ... when i think about the future when they wo n't be around anymore i start tearing up .
i also feel bad when my mum tells me about those funny moments we had when i was young and i ca n't really remember but i still play along .
i try to make the best out of the time that we still have now as a family by spending more time with them .
none i 'd say thanks for making all the right decisions .
like has been said it becomes a reckless operation which is a misdemeanor when you are speeding that excessively .
you will want to check the ticket to see what is actually written there .
also a lot will depend on what is on the report that the officer makes .
assuming the citation is reckless operation being a misdemeanor it does carry possible jail time but i think that is probably pretty unlikely .
ultimately it will probably end up just being a fine of a few hundred dollars and some kind of mark on your record unless given an expungible or plead down but i would want to consult a lawyer anyway especially considering your circumstances of being a foreigner .
there could be other complications and i would n't want to just wing it without professional consultation .

the entire country of honduras wants to go ... .and they do n't even need a visa .
they have to act like they are coming bavk so they have to buy a roundtrip ticket .
i know people that left honduras after the obama administration ok 'd a coup and left a dictator in power that recently stole the sham election he actually lost .
he stopped the vote counting before midnight when it was evident he was going to lose and then he had more ballots fabricated to reverse the loss and voided millions of votes for the opposing candidate and also had voter rolls falsified with false signatures .
i was going to say i was jealous i 've always wanted to at least live in nyc for bit ... a year or two maybe ... .but uhhhh now i do n't feel so angry about paying 2100/mo for a 3000sqft house with 5 bedrooms and yards i have three kids four when my boyfriend 's daughter is here two adults and two pets .

was n't her choice to continue an already sexual encounter fully coherent and with every opportunity to leave pretty clear communication on its own ?
simply because somebody is interested in you does n't give you permission to do everything your dick desires .
i would argue that there were certainly signals indicating that she wanted to stay and continue the encounter .
it was pretty clear that she wanted to continue the encounter but not in the way ansari wanted to .
she told him several times she liked him but did n't want to have sex tonight and he kept pressuring her to have sex tonight .
what about the culture of considering women adults who are capable of making sexual choices ?
well in order to create a culture where women can make sexual choices it would be best to allow them to make a choice instead of jamming your fingers down their throats trying to get them drunk dragging their hands towards your dick 5-7 times and ignoring them every time they tell you they are n't interested .
ballot initiative would be the plan with the best chance of working .

at the cheesecake factory ordering liquor neat is 2oz instead of 1 .

in response to china 's decisions we are moving our ip 's from hong kong to an offshore location .
now we have our ips registered in bvi british virgin islands and other locations .
so we are registered in multiple locations and we have people in multiple locations .
that way we will never be affected by one regulatory body . ''
well it definitely could be a heroin fent mix or just cut fent but are n't the purple coated morphines ?
never did morphine much and it was a decade ago but i vaguely remember getting the coating off of a purple one .
which then the powder of the pill would be white off white a little .
however that does n't go along with how it made you feel .
then you being extra nervous and having anxiety to begin with may have contributed to your feelings .

they 're getting really good at talking a good game to get things through edg but there 's basically no enforcement when it comes to actually building things as they 're proposed at least in terms of how the space is used .
this post and the one about payton and how he did n't read the mail from isaac ...
i have midis ripped from the game which i then modify to play back correctly on the sc-88 pro by removing invalid program change commands which cause instrument changes to not work and then i change and edit the remaining instruments by ear until they sound accurate .
usually it 's just something simple like changing out a piano since the instruments used in the game are n't anything special they barely deviate from the 128 capital tones of the 88 pro .
hopefully the cash is automatically converted into usable currency of the time period .
i would use that money to travel to germany murder hitler and proceed to take over germany .
enthusiastic consent '' means that you make sure that your partner is 100 into what is going on .
if the person is silent you check in with them .
if they say they are feeling pressured as grace did you back off .
if they say they do n't want to have sex on a first date as grace did you back off .
the whole point of enthusiastic consent is to get rid of well she did n't say no . ''
enthusiastic consent means you need a clear yes to proceed .
grace ca n't fail at enthusiastic consent because she did n't initiate anything .
aziz took of both of their clothes aziz instigated fellatio and cunnilingus .
he asked the enthusiastic consent questions but he took silence as an excuse to keep pushing rather than asking do you want to stop hooking up ? ''
wait you ca n't laminate it to protect it from easily getting damaged ?
canada used to give out plastic social insurance number sin cards years ago but that stopped for whatever reason .

then it becomes a huge thing when people find out and they fire him for being a man to bring the irony to the maximum level of poignancy .
shooting is important to us though and he is an offensive guard .
elfrid payton would be a better steal for us though i believe in him .
like if we snagged payton for a second and hood that would be solid .
vuch would also be an interesting choice but he 'd have to be a backup center or work on his shot .
i do n't know about mack though how would he work with the team ?
you are in for a very rough surprise quite shortly ... once kanans unique gets shared you 'll find the 5x ps counter aoe pile drive is nothing to fuck with sth or even baze ...
i have a couple cheapo longline bralettes from walmart .
they 're not really longlines on me but they keep everything inside .
you could honestly make a better team out of just the 2013 draft than the next four combined .
it wo n't because it has a very narrow field of view which makes it useless for looking for things near/in our solar system .
wide-field infrared telescopes are the ones best suited for finding planet 9 and the jwst is a very narrow field infrared telescope .
i like how they use a gender-neutral term for the supposed genderfluid person in this
yeah i had to do this as a kid before we had the harness thing we just used two hockey sticks to pull each other .
it 's not just about race it 's about voting in general .
even areas of predominately white people are segregated into benefiting republican votes .

you 're probably not a bad parent you 're putting way too much pressure on yourself .

with the political commentary all they are trying to do is make the show rooted in the real world .
they have always had a bit of what 's going on in the world injected in the show .
this show also has a huge root in religious lore but i 'd does n't matter what your age sex religion sexual orientation skin color or how much money you have it is never an issue to these boys and their family .

it 's so annoying that reddit seemingly really does n't want a good app out there .
they bought alien blue and then replaced it with an incomplete app that does n't have all of reddit 's normal features much less all the alien blue features .
then when another good reddit app appears they want it gone .
i know that they want control over how their customers are using their product but they should know that more customers would be interested in the app if it was actually good !
best part of this gif will always be the racket twirl at the end .
the alternative is that it does n't value any outcome more than any other which would not be intelligent behaviour but random behaviour .
you could say the slime mold cares about getting food or you could say it acts as if it cares but there is no difference behaviorally .
there is something compelling it to get the food and that is functionally the same as an 'ought ' .
humans are physical machines compelled by physical laws what we call 'oughts ' are ultimately derived only from physical laws .
you may say surely that is getting an 'ought ' from an 'is ' and your right but it is not getting an 'ought ' from an 'is ' through reason which is the thing that is impossible because all reasoning starts with an 'ought ' or it 's functional equivalent .
ai will not get an 'ought ' from any 'is ' through deliberate reasoned action/thought only through us putting it there where it will come from our 'oughts ' or non deliberate consequences like some evolutionary process or corruption of data .
the point is it will have something compelling it to act so it 's actions are deliberate and we get to decide what that is .
it could be something stupid like making it value paperclips above all else or something slightly more clever like valuing human thriving above all else and from the 'oughts ' that are deduceable from those values in the same way that our 'oughts ' are deduceable from how our brains are and it 's knowledge of the world all else will follow .
please do not speak of something you barely know and ever played .
it really is insulting that you are trying to speak and actually do not know the mode at all .
slow considering it 's just supposed to be a single lane constant-brawl .
like it 's not even close not even a debate .
if you had any actual experience on the mode you 'd know that .
you are disqualifying yourself from having any chance to be useful in a debate on a matter you have virtually no experience of .
would you say that hero league rounds should be shorter than quick match ?
if you said yes did you forget that there 's the whole drafting phase which takes up a few minutes ?
so yes on average it takes longer even if people go for the core and finish more reliably .
the draft is in itself intense at times and the gameplay feels better .
the same however can be true in reverse for aram a normal match of 25-30 minutes can feel shorter '' than an aram of 15 minutes simply because the former has a lot more happening and displays more varied situations .
which is n't necessarily a negative thing for aram it 's a game mode all about removing elements of the full moba experience to facilitate a more focused sharpened format .
but in turn this means it has to be focused or it 'll lose the reason it was thought up in the first place .
and in heroes at least with modern balance there 's too little pushing the two sides together to clash in it .
in normal maps the overall strong objectives do force this engagement .
it could be 6-8 minutes if there were a mechanic forcing harder engagements and that extra time of dancing around each other is quite noticable .
yeah you could definitely go down the gokyo valley i think i was a bit tired by the time i left ren jo pass and just wanted to get some good meals in at namche i dont remember that last part being anything too special .
when i did cho la it was just blue ice completely impassable without spikes .
i had been expecting an icefield with some snow but its a legit glacier which is awesome to see btw .
i heard some guides saying that when theres snow on the pass its possible to do without spikes but its not worth taking the risk people have gotten hurt trying to cross it .
ebc is more much commercial than annapurna so everything is catered towards the tourists there 's no villages like manang or kagbeni in the khumbu but it makes sense since those 2 are old settlements where people have lived for hundreds of years .
i dont think too many people lived north of namche or tengboche before the climbing industry really kicked off .
namche was my favorite town on ebc its such a unique place .
i think i had lunch in pengboche on the way to dingboche but i didnt really explore the town it has a monastery that you can check out if you 're feeling up to an extra 200 m climb .
the views of ama dablan from that area are out of this world .
the italian pyramid is a luxury experience compared to the other towns .
more important though is that the insulation is much better lobuche and gorak shep can get cold .
the italian pyramid is built like an arctic base so you 'll have no problems there .

i 'd love to be able to put a suppressor on the mp55 .
i think the main thing the game 's missing is end game loot .
the only thing that 's hard to get is a rifle suppressor theres so much potential for rarer guns more diverse attachments .
an airdrop system like pubg or heli crashes like dayz would n't be a bad idea it 'd be a hotspot for pvp and good loot .
i 've just never seen a company go through a single round of layoffs and so because of that it seems that actioning a plan is bullshit .

no because taxes would have eaten up a lot of ur profits so you risk not being able to buy back as many .
it would be proper if the really big consumers like the us did the same to hasten a transition .

if you consistently make stupid mistakes you should definitely not be a heavy machinery operator ... working at a steel mill if i had someone like that operating around me i would n't do my job until it was rectified .
not knowing anything about you though i truly do n't think problems like that are due to intelligence but lack of attention to detail .
with that out of the way i 'm sure it depends on where you get your job at .
some machinery operators work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week rotating days to nights others work a dupont schedule .
i ca n't only speak for our operators at my mill though .
yea that 's a high bar indeed but the chins are easiest
when it 's nesrly time to close up and a bunch of customers come in and end up taking ages to eat their food .
so you 've got to stay late to close up .
but it also has a battery back-up and it still uses wifi .
once someone tampers with it alerts you even before an alarm will sound .
which also triggers the camera to turn on as well if you have one .
but if all that fails you pay the 50 per year for cellular back-up .
so regardless of what a criminal tries to do .
your going to get notified one way or another that something is wrong .
i was thinking the same thing when i got this ca n't they just unplug it .
nope its just as loud when the alarm sounds .
also it notifies all users faster if they do unplug it .
so it does n't mean that sanctions will be implemented on 29th of january .

sooner or later you 'll just naturally accept it so do n't worry too much .

if kids can remember kim kardashian they can remember franklin d roosevelt .
and i would dispute that kids are being forced to learn just names and dates its a false premise because this guy 's blog looks pretty dumb .
to learn the lessons and controversies the good stuff about history you sadly have to know a fair amount of facts first like you have to know some dry mathematics to design a plane or some boring anatomy to perform heart surgery or be a nurse .
there is no easy way out no 'dumb option ' .
unless you 've got all you need from history by knowing that sailors caught birds while at sea .
the good news is that history can be taught well by engaged and knowledgeable teachers who can make kids learn the names and order of events without them finding it all hard and challenging and in need of remediation by some internet guru .
i 'm honestly curious as to whether we 'll get a complete definitive version of ffxv before or after the ffvii remake is released .
they 're in a museum which you are night guarding .
i agree with just wearing them and that the shine will fade .
also you are correct that this would be more appropriate for the sq thread .

she does n't want tomoko to go this way .
people ignore certain facts to push their agenda 's .
wait a second ... they 're charging 49.99 for the royal edition ?
if that 's true then anyone who bought the game at release will be paying atleast 45 extra if you bought the season pass and plan to buy the new 20 dlc .
they recoil because people beliving them gives them nice flow of money .
just to add to that i think communication plays a bigger role than people give it credit for .
i 'm only level 70ish but i 've noticed that people do n't call out a whole lot even if they 're level 400 and ranked in gold or even platinum .
it 's not that they are n't capable of it but for a variety of reasons people just do n't communicate well in matchmade lobbies .
in silver and gold this is particularly bad because people will just run in and let themselves get staggered .
i 'm not a support main per se but i play it often enough to say that you can be a voice of reason for your team if they 're willing to listen .
micromanagement is annoying but measured game management can be really valuable .
because supports tend to play a little bit farther back and monitor the whole battlefield they 're in a good position to keep tabs on the ult economy or suggest a strong position to play from .
you can ask people to wipe and wait for spawns to avoid staggering in lower ranks literally just waiting for an actual team fight like that can win the game .
even if your callout is just i ca n't help their widow has me covered '' it will help your team make better decisions .
if you hear a rip tire ask d.va to fly you out or zarya to bubble you or whatever .
if you get killed do n't give them the classic sigh just tell the appropriate teammate that x hero is kicking your ass and you need them to play close to you until that hero is dead .
you could even phrase it as genji or tracer or whoever is after me bait me and kill him '' .

i 'm on mobile now and you 're not worth the extra trouble it takes to give you the bread crumbs .

but confabulation verb confabulate derived from the latin word fabula eng fable and it 's composed by two latin words 1. con eng together 2. fabulari eng verbs conversate chatting that both mixed create the word confabulari confabulate confabulation eng engage in conversation chatting together talking !
however my intention as i explained in my first comment was to utilize both meanings in one title because as you see this photo confuses the reality with the past and the three of them are also talking together !

i think that 's a legitimate concern when it comes to coercion .

hi i 'm a 22 y/o male 170 pounds 6'2 .
i 've currently got two shallow but annoying canker sores one on upper right gum above the top row of teeth and the other on the lower left interior of the lip .
i get them somewhat often but not too badly had a flare up of one in august 2017 that healed and have n't had one until right now .
i have had some digestive problems recently although it does not include the classic crohn 's symptom of diarrhea quite the opposite actually .
i 've even gotten tested for it colonoscopy with biopsies of colon and the last part of the small intestine ileum ?
sorry if this is a stupid question but i 'm a pretty anxious person by nature if these tests were negative then are these canker sores just caused by irritating food or stress/trauma ?

it seems like i need to unplug it and replug it to play anything on my external after turning on the console .
the drive boots up the action light blinks but it will not load any games .
after it misses up i ca n't load any game or app at all in my internal .
i think there should be a combat attribute that is the opposite of knock back which would keep enemies near you .
i guess it could sort of be like '' trap '' or something .
this would be super helpful for dealing with the ubiquitous bats and also the ghosts that appear in skull cavern .
was wondering if there was any kind of significant upgrade as the the solo is more affordable .
i am looking over some eth transactions and noticed value missing when i have sent eth from coinbase to another eth address .
for example one eth purchase worth 140 which i sent out immediately and it shows sent to eth address 133.72 .
now if i click on the purchase for 140 i only see a 1 fee and if i click on the sent transaction i see a fee of 0.00189000 eth so let 's say 2 .
so this morning in a rush to take advantage of the major dip i attempted to use my linked capital one venture card to purchase some eth on coinbase .
my transaction was declined so i tried again with a lower amount and still no dice ... .
this prompted a call to capital one in order to try and remove whatever was blocking my purchase .
after jumping through a few hoops and getting patched to the fraud department i was informed that as of today capital one was cirulating an internal memo that they would be to automatically declining all coinbase purchases and a number of other exchanges that the operator did n't disclose going forward .
this could spell some trouble and likely added to the crash today .
just thought i would pass along some info that is n't being widely reported .
so i noticed this alot that tank mines have a habit of forgeting about gravity and start flaoting away .
one instance and it was rather hilarious mind you .

yes it is a problem but by merciful neptune how could you not die from laughter over it .
i 've seen a lot of threads discussing kylo 's future will he be redeemed killed betrayed exiled etc ?
the obvious choice is that rey will defeat/redeem kylo and will train the new generation of force users for the next trilogy .
i think there 's a good chance that she might turn to the dark side or she might at leas be heavily tempted by it .
i know she rejected it in tlj but as of now she may have equal or better reasons than anakin or kylo ever had to turn
her parents did one of the worst things parents can do to their child so i can definitely see her being very angry not just because she was discarded but also because her entire life was terrible because of it .
this contrasts with anakin who despite being a slave had a loving mother and a decent childhood .
by the time episode ix starts she will have lost any kind of parental figure she had han luke leia .
she yearns for companionship and keeps losing all the people she starts to see as a potential family which could be very frustrating plus there will be no one to teach her how to not fall to the dark side unless ghost luke appears .
anakin 's frustration at not being taken seriously by the jedi order and not being able to be with padme are big reasons he ended up turning .
this means that in episode ix finn will be all she has maybe poe too .
if finn dies i can totally see her reaching the breaking point the same way padme 's death was the last drop .
other hints are that kylo says he saw a future in which rey turns to the dark side .
also luke freaked out at her going to the dark side without even resisting .
in the end we may have a redeemed but exiled kylo training new force users and a fallen rey .
i know it 's a long shot but if jj decides to go that way i think the pieces are in place .
i 'm from pittsburgh and if you guys follow baseball you know the pirates are one of the worst franchises in all of sports .
their recent trades have officially made me too disgusted to consider myself a fan of them anymore .
at the same time i do n't want to only follow football steelers and hockey pens .
as a fan of the steelers and pens i 'm looking for a team that is committed to winning every year but i also like to root for players that are good dudes off the field court too .
i do n't want to jump on the golden state bandwagon because i 'm sure that filled up long ago .
i 'm not fond of cleveland even though they 're the closest geographically to me .
hi everyone i will be travelling to vietnam in a couple of weeks and am looking for any information on cigars in vietnam .
i have only smoked a few cigars and am a novice but will be trying as many cigars as i can i was thinking i could write a review of each one that i try and post here after thought you might enjoy .
does anyone know good places to get cigars in hanoi ?
what would be a pretty safe bet for cigars ?
is it worth trying anything or pick something with a bit of a name to it ?
would any dodgy cigar make me sick in any way ?
not really a smoker but this community is great .

we bought a table before we bought chairs for it .
maybe not the smartest move but we found a table we loved so we went with it .

looking for anything similar to this at about 100/chair as we need four of them .
doctor who actually went mad when he looked into the abyss of eternity .
he made a choice that split him to be the doctor or to be the master .
he split personalities/bodies and now to survive he splits every time it 's time for him to die and a new doctor is born the next generation to try to let the old doctor die .
yet the old demons from the past will not stop coming back .
he dies fighting them over and over the same hill .
only to die change come back to life only to fight it again .
the master was worse than the daleks and cybermen because the doctor loves him .
two sides of the coin locked in eternal battle all whilst saving that little bit of his humanity that remained .
but the one place the doctor can not visit but can clearly see is himself at the moment the split happened .
he pities the other half the master half that saw the same trauma and decided he needed to control everything hence of course his name .

i 'm someone who uses v and drags whatever i 'm going to ping it 's kind of weird that i have to set a totally different key for one specific ping .
should n't it be a part of the rest of them ?
so i installed vridge 2.0 on my desktop windows 7 and phone s7edge 7.0 and i can connect and start steam vr but once in vr i ca n't select or click on anything .
i tried moonlight and that worked about the same no interactions .
checked the faq and googled and could n't find any answers .
i have a small site that needs translation functionality .
i tried using the gtranslate plugin but the main issue is i ca n't manually override a translation .

i was just inspired by a friend of mine to start an if schedule .
he only eats one meal a day and was spouting off the benefits .
he is a fitness buff and says he has really noticed a difference in his performance since he 's been doing it .
my other friend was doing 18:6 eating time from 12pm-6pm so i thought i 'd try that .
i 'm on day 2 and ate past my end fast time at 8pm because i was really hungry .
i did n't eat too much during my eating period however because by the time noon rolls around i find my hunger has subsided so i wait but by the time i do eat i get really full super fast and i find it hard to eat again before 6pm .
i 'm wondering if a way to mitigate this would be eat right at noon and then again at 4 or 5pm ?
something substantial each time like not just a piece of fruit .
or should i ease myself into this more gradually like trying a 12pm-8pm eating period ?
fyi another factor here is i have struggled on and off for most of my teens/adult life sadly with disordered eating going on binges and then fast periods to mitigate the binge calorie counting restricting all coming from not good places .
i am drawn to if because i am inspired by its health benefits and the idea of having to eat in a specific period helps me as well as not feeling the need to obsess over calories so much because i know i will be fasting for a specific time of the day .
the regularity and routine of if appeals to me as someone who has had really all over the place eating habits .
but i do know that not wanting to eat when noon rolls around and finding it hard to eat again if i 'm not totally hungry come from my entrenched ed patterns .
tdlr wondering about if best practices and tips for a newbie and for a newbie with a history of disordered eating
not to mention that they only flush when you do n't want them to flush and never flush when you actually do want them to flush .

i signed a lease yesterday with honda for 36 months .
i traded in my 2014 ford focus which had 5500 negative equity .
my old payment was 213 for financing and now my lease for a 2018 civic is 350 .
i failed to really consider my finances and realized i ca n't afford the payment because of the insurance hiking up too .
i 've read online that carmax or another dealer can buy out your car ... is that true ?
gross capitalized cost and adjusted capital cost is 22,271 .
does carmax give me a check for the value and i just pay honda ?
i ca n't see my payoff amount yet because i just signed yesterday ... but is the payoff 22271 or 12,100 ?

he grew up in a fundamentalist teaching of christianity .
was n't trying to deconvert him but i did want to open him up to a world outside what he 's known all his life .
i met him through steam we both played a lot of coh2 together .
he 's 1 of 12 sons his family has .
i think knowing that there was a big forum of just exchristians was shocking to him he thought it was his mission to convert you guys started quoting a few biblical quotes in which members kindly pointed out the no proselytizing rule to him .
he may be a lost cause i generally avoid religion and politics with him but he tried converting me to his religion southern babtist i believe and so i told him he 'd have to view some of my media and communities i go to this one being one of them .
i remember him commenting in a thread by u/beedubya i forget how to spell his user name who is a contributor here and i told him the man is gay and went through a very troubling childhood due to fundamentalist upbringing in life if you know which user i 'm talking about please link him to this .
his politics from my point of view was just absurd he was the first person to introduce me to infowars but instead of viewing it as outlandish conspiracy theories for entertainment i think he legitimately thought it was news that was true unlike my sources of information .
kind of a sad story really the guy does n't really live in reality on political media or scientific matters and i think he 's younger than me .
makes a better income than me successful in that regard but still lives with his parents i do too for that matter so i ca n't really talk down on him for that .
i tried recommending him to go to some classes at a community college learn about other aspects in life he wo n't get from religion .
he has n't talked to me in months it 's possible without really knowing that he found this forum really offensive considering he even had a chat with his pastor about it .
that pic that always covers his minimap what is it ?

btc has been trading quite stable above a price of 10,500 usd on all exchanges since past few days which makes me think whether the btc price will go below 10k usd again ?
i would love for this to happen one more time so that i buy more btc and then we are set for the price of btc to rocket to moon d
with all the good news in pipeline for btc i think the odds for this to happen are less .
the myth of bitcoin being a bubble will gradually be proven wrong .
btc has mainstream media attention like never before and this will only attract more people to invest in it with fomo .

just bought a 6-pack of foster 's and i was surprised to find how bad it tastes .
sorry aussies but germans are so much better at making beer .
i live in finland and even the cheap locally produced shit beer tastes better than foster 's .
i 'm always looking for new brands to taste and so far my favourite is nobelander with the second place tied between a.le coq and koff .
you know a part of me says i should get angry at him for giving up on me and hurting me and all the things i should be indignant about .
another bigger part though is my love for him i ca n't seem to paint him like this cruel jerk my anger seems to be convincing me .
and i care about him so much but i also do n't think that is helping me .
so its hard to explain that feeling ... but ill try .
my first relationship were at the age of 16 my first sex at 17 and i had sex with 4 women did sexual stuff not only intercourse will total of 8
women dated 11 and had 2 serious realetionships for over a year .
my last sex was about 5-6 months ago and my last serious relationshop where 2 years ago ... .
i ware much more naive at the first relationships .
for very long time i just couldnt bee alone .
beeing in a relationship of any sort were kind of adiction ...
at my last relationship 2 years ago i were daiting a girl for over a year .
short and cute like a girl but breasts and hips like a women .
we had the same humor and she enjoyed even the weired part of me ...
only problem was that i wasnt in love with here .
her charecter and beuty were so much my type ... but why couldnt i feel for her what she felt for me ?
untill this day only thing comes to mind is that beacuse she was so in to me i couldnt not taking her for grented .
i ended up braking up with here after a year and an half told her its just not fair to her ... .
it made me think ... that the only 2 girls i ever had this feeling for didnt gave a shit about me .
its like im broken and can fall only for the wrong girls ...
she said she will still want to be in touch with me because im still very speacial to her .
few month later she calls me and telling me that she moves the countrey for an year of working at south america selling marketing and stuff
i was the one to brake up with her so maybe i deserved that .
but i was here first and only that she had sex with and that broke me ...
i couldnt resist ... i ask were they better ? ''
she answard that one of them didnt have ad big as me but were better ''
last 2 years i wasnt too much sexual active '' .
i had sex once daited once diffrent girl for few days and got a blowjob at a bar a year ago .
i can deal so much better with beeing alone then before .
most of the times i even feel that its better that way untill i realy get more stady and could hold a relationship .
somtimes i bust in to tears for long hours ... hugging my pillow and remembering my last ex and trying to remember her warm hugs and the night cuddeling ...
i miss this stuff so much more that i miss the sex that was amazing by itself ...
somtimes i want a new relationship just so i could stop thinking about her ...
i get this thoughts somtimes about how i broke up with the perfect girl for me ...
how propably somone else is making her happy right now like how i used to
somtimes i try to make myself remember that nostalgia is a lier ...
but who am i kidding ... that wont help ...
i had experience that helped feel better about beeing alone .
but i have hard plashbacks from my last real relationships that make me want to die inside .
of how to get over this or how to try and get a new relationship or even just feel better about myself ...
on monday i try to place a same-day shipment order on amazon just like i do about 3 times a week .
so i thought okay maybe the same-day option does n't work on holidays martin luther king day was monday .
so the next day it still shows only a one-day delivery option available .
the same day was nonexistent on monday and tuesday .
so today i get on there now it is showing only two day shipping exists on their website .
i did a chat with an agent and they said on their end it is showing the items are eligible for same day and my address is eligible for same day as well .
well then what the heck is the problem ! ?
please other amazon prime members ... has your same/one-day delivery option disappeared too ?
or does anyone know what the heck is going on ?
my zip code is 37130 so i know that my address is not what the issue is here .
the prime now 2 hour shipping for varied items is working fine but the same/one day has vanished from my account !
i 'm going crazy over here ! ! ! !
i 'm not a manga person or an anime one but i watched sao 1 and 2 on netflix and i really enjoyed it .
i was wondering if there were any official sources for me to watch the film and any other new content .
will i be able to level my skins after the event ?
i bought a home with poly pipe pos inspector told me it was a grey version of pex .
almost every fixture has a dedicated run back to a manifold for hot and cold .
i do n't know if the pipe was installed for each run without any breaks i.e. whether the 100 ' run is made up of two or more coupled sections but if they are single runs with no couplings then i am wondering
can i just install sharkbites at all the relevant fixtures and be done with this problem ?
we are on well water and every leak has occurred at the fitting between the poly and the fixture .
when we have a leak repaired under home warranty so not the best quality contractors perhaps they put a sharkbite on it and its done .
i am wondering why it is not a recommended solution .
i got a quote for a repipe last week and it was really high .
i asked the plumber about my idea and he laughed and said he would n't allow his crew to do that sort of hack job . ''
so maybe one of you could be so kind as to tell me why i am an idiot for trying to avoid turning the house into swiss cheese .
we have had several leaks but every one of them has been where the pipe meets the fixture and on one of the 2 ts '' that run to 2 different outdoor spigots they seem to be the only pipe that has a connection .
just wanted to verify some facts and if i left anything out .
i 'm not including the type of strings or guit body type or guit.amp/effects .
also if i understand it the humbucker form factor is not as good as the soapbar type because of not having the minimum 10k wraps .
i do like alnico 2 's for the mids but some ytube vids make the alnico 5 's sound better .
i ca n't find a definite answer on which models or at least how many models come with it when purchased for rift the answers i have google range from 1 to 30 models ?

i do know a few facts about the history of mochi .
it is believed that special seraphs worshiped as gods brought the rice to make mochi to the people and in return humanity made mochi as an offering to the seraphs .
mochi was so revered that it was only eaten by royals and being given mochi as a wedding present marked a long and fruitful marriage !

i was wondering if it 'll hold a 60 liter 16g aquarium ?
right now there 's a medium sized printer on it which i might move .

does anyone have experience with that kind of desk ?
i 'd really like to use it so the aquarium is right next to me when i 'm at my desk .
only a limited run but nice to see the return of something so iconic .

i just want to put out there that i think nintendo is doing the virtual console wrong for the gba series in my opinion .
they would easily be able to make enough money in micro-transactions .
by that i mean offer the app for free but every game would cost something .
there are a lot of emulators but if nintendo can release hardware emulators nes classic and the snes classic and make a ton of money they probably be able to make nice chunk of change a d further their push into mobile gaming .
also there is the ability to make money off of streamers from youtube twitch and mobcrush .
damn i believe it 's the first time i faced him after the rune change and it seems like if he lands any ability you ca n't run away anymore

just then i remembered my dex dose and googled some symptoms and now i am kindve worried to go to sleep .

i recently found in my sister 's closet the same t-shirt i have but brand new .
i compared them they 're the same size while me and my sister are not .
she swears she did n't buy it and also it would be tricky to find it since i bought it in an outlet and they did n't have many of them .
i got it for my birthday aaand few days later i found another one in a kitchen .
i asked my family they did n't buy it they did n't even see it before .
it 's easy to say i just do n't remember getting it maybe some friend left it or such but i 'm pretty sure that 's not the case .
engineering and engineer in general get a lot of hate .
everyone bitches how they were forced to do it .but no one suggests some viable alternative.so what is viable career alternative to engineering .not counting doctor ca as i think they are not that different from engineering as they are also very traditional careers followed by masses albeit more difficult
i have been trying to figure out which movie this is from for the longest time maybe my google-ing skills just suck that bad !
i can not figure it out and i am on the verge of accepting this movie/scene was just a dream ha !
the movie if it exists that i am trying to remember contains a scene in which the terrorists possibly cyber-terrorists ?
broadcast their threat/message to the public using video clips of presidential speeches .
this is done similar to the way baracksdubs 's channel on youtube https www.youtube.com/user/baracksdubs/featured makes obama sing famous songs only instead of just obama its various presidents aaand instead of songs its a message .
i am pretty sure this movie came out before obama 's terms but not too long before so no obama speeches used in the movie .
i remember next to nothing from the movie which is partially why i am afraid the movie is not real and possibly because i think it blends in my memory with other action movies .
i believe the scene shows the broadcasted video message everywhere hence the possibility of cyber-terrorists but i remember specifically it was broadcasted on a street digital billboard and everyone walking by stops to watch and listen .
sorry if i am being a moronic but i have enough smart to run a node and i have a spare macbook pro that i could use to run it firstly have they released a working file for osx and secondly is there any way that i could run the node on a cloud computing service like digital ocean so that im not burning up my laptop all day .

in the doctrine and covenants there is that verse that says before the foundation of the world women were ah created to bear and care for the sons and daughters of god and in doing so they glorify god .
62 and if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law he can not commit adultery for they belong to him and they are given unto him therefore is he justified .
63 but if one or either of the ten virgins after she is espoused shall be with another man she has committed adultery and shall be destroyed for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth according to my commandment and to fulfil the promise which was given by my father before the foundation of the world and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds that they may bear the souls of men for herein is the work of my father continued that he may be glorified .
yeah but the actual product that 's consumed is generally the same
i do n't use magnified optics for shooting i use them for spotting and identifying enemy players at long range .
besides most variable zoom optics change their zero when you change the magnification .
zero the optic for its lowest magnification and use that for combat .
if you 're not shooting at the higher magnification does n't matter what the zero is .
alright lem me add you and i will be heading to the plaza after that
if we opened the borders people would not suddenly invade the us by the hundreds of millions or something .
economic immigrants would come in until it stopped making economic sense and political immigrants the folks we should be really caring about folks who generally have trades and who therefore could boost an economy at all levels and the folks trump singled out with the shithole country '' comment would continue to come in but are never that high in number especially for a geographically isolated nation such as ours .

my question is about deciphering stamped and hand etched numbers/letters on the runouts of vinyl .
i have quite a few albums i 'm having difficulty placing on my collection on discogs because i ca n't match the run off category .
for example ... frank sinatra 's album close to you ...
the number stamped on my runout for side 1 is w1-789-n10 side is stamped with w2-789-n5 .
is the closest i can find but not exact .
what are some other ways i can define my search to figure out what editions i have .

pm club has annual one at 75 pounds 103 nearly half price compared to monthly fee of 15 .
no logic paying vaders monthly unless for a initial test .
in my opinion the lower scorestreak need to be reduced in cost the higher scorestreaks need to be buffed .
kills for a uav is madness especially on dom where you need twice the amount of kills due to the 50pt kills .
i regularly go through numerous games in dom where no one in the lobby gets a single streak ...
then the high streaks paratroopers are what 15 kills ?
and for that you 're lucky to get 2 or 3 kills from the paratroopers sometimes .
ball turret gunner cost even more it 's over before it 's begun and actually quite difficult to use to .
the high streaks generally are n't worth getting and provide no incentive to the game and most of the time have little to no impact on the outcome of a match .
it 's got to the point where i run uav counter uav and care package because 1 i know they 're the only ones i 'll realistically be able to earn and 2 the higher streaks are n't worth having

harboring perversion is something that i 've been handling quite well and i do n't think otherwise it 's too bad to have some lewd thoughts from time to time about her cuz let 's face it everyone had lewd thoughts sometimes .

usually recruiters are a third party company but not always for temporary work .
recruiters will have contracts for certain periods of time direct hire positions and a mix of the two .
just because you are working with a recruiter does n't mean it 's only temporary .
many recruiting companies have their own benefits packages with 401k insurance the whole nine yards .
even if you have to do contract work for some experience do n't knock it .
the recruiters will make sure you do n't have gaps of unemployment .
also contracts are great entry points into a company do well enough and they just might hire you on full time !

the wording is that way because spells like enlarge person are technically '' saving throw spells but you are 9/10 times choosing to allow it to hit you cause it helps you so you choose to fail the save the wording is that way to make it clear you dont have to use the bonus and loss out on a beneficial spell being casted on you

a few hours before running as tank also a wardens 2 to get the 20 essences bonus one other idiot immediately directs the beam to the overloaded lens kills the group writes healer ? ? ? ? ? ? ''

what i mean by party fetish is essentially what i observe with the icc for example where party building '' becomes the goal the organisation becomes the end in itself applies even more to trots .
this is actually rather similar to the councilist fetish of workers ' councils and democracy where once again the means becomes the end in itself .
the middle ground '' is essentially not one it 's just to consider those means as not so sacred just as means and not actually necessarily essential to revolution .
maybe workers wo n't organize themselves in workers ' councils .
so be it the main understanding to get from council communists is the that the emancipation of the working class must be the act of the working class itself '' as marx says .
similarly maybe the organisation wo n't have a role to play .
what i also see as a mystification is seeing the party as representative of the proletariat something inherited from kautsky and lenin .
the communist left in germany 1918-1921 by dauvé and authier hammers on this point a lot and if you have n't already read it it 's well worth a read .
basically dauvé is very critical of 20th century socialism 's tendency to construct idealized deus ex machinas to either explain or remedy the proletariat 's lack of activity .
he identifies this both as a historical trend luxemburg 's fetishization of spontaneity the german-dutch left 's fetishization of the councils and the italian left 's fetishization of the party while also seeing in the modern left a tendency to look back at failed historical revolutions in this manner .
to this latter point he uses pierre broué trotskyist author of the well-acclaimed book the german revolution 1917-1923 as an example
broué is led to a consideration of history based not on the actual events but on the basis of what did not take place at all .
his problem can be summarized as measuring the impact of the absence of the party .
he bases himself on what did not exist in order to understand what did exist .
communism as in activity that emanates directly from the proletariat 's own actions against capital will become almost unavoidably idealized in this manner when that action dwindles
the organizational question inevitably acquires excessive importance when proletarian action is lacking
all activity brings theoretical deviation with it by transforming a means to an end which is often corrected by the unfolding of the action itself but not always
adorno also touches on this idea in marginalia to theory and praxis '' also well worth a read
praxis is a source of power for theory but can not be prescribed by it .
it appears in theory merely and indeed necessarily as a blind spot as an obsession with what is being criticized no critical theory can be practiced in particular detail without overestimating the particular but without the particularity it would be nothing .
this admixture of delusion however warns of the excesses in which it incessantly grows . ''

well it all depends on the timing of when mueller releases the conclusion of the investigation .
it will either drop a few weeks before the 2018 election which will force republicans to take a stand or be true cowards .
depending on how bad it is republicans will have to make a choice between condemning trump and moving forward with impeachment or ignore it and face losing reelection .
a lot of them who thought they were in safe states but will be challenged and the investigation concluding before the midterms could hurt a lot of gop campaigns .
if their is a blue wave like everyone is saying and democracts retake the house and maybe a small majority in the senate not sure it 's possible the map favors republicans and a lot are n't up for reelection until 2020 .
but let 's democrats win big on a referendum against trump a lot of these spineless cowards will realize that trump is doing them no favors and opposing him will actually benefit them .
personally i am tempering my optimism that the investigation will take down trump .
i 'm mentally prepared for 4 years of trump .
he will definitely be primaried in 2020 and hopefully democrats can put forth a good candidate .
i believe the only reason he won was because no one was excited about hilary and no one thought she would lose so lots of dems stayed home .

it does n't matter though you 'll never touch the water or anything unless you were deliberately reaching down as far as possible .
the first era was more raw and emotional and had a more natural sounding flow .
the second era is better in terms of technical ability like rhymes wordplay and speed .
personally i prefer the first era because it sounds better to me but i appreciate the skill in relapse and mmlp2 .
would have been closer if i liked recovery and revival more .
there 's a mod you can download called 'uber ' gives you access to a taxi service that really takes all effort out of moving from one area to the next .

my unhappiness comes both from my salary dissatisfaction and from the attitude of manager and how treats me .
now i may overcome the salary-related unhappiness and not the manager-related but in this company managers change often so leaving a company because of m might not be the best decision i guess ...
and tbh the reason i started looking for jobs was because i wanted a raise really

trump if people took a step back and put what he says into context they will find that he is not a racist or sexist or whatever ist '' .
you 're asking me to have basic facts to argue my case but yet you just said the majority of the worlds religions are fine with eating meat .
once again out of the major religions only the abrahamic religions condone eating meat .
the sikhs hindus buddhists etc so not allow eat .
three religions compared next to one overall religion seeing as how jews islam and christians actually all believe in the same god .
you have no clue what you 're talking about anymore
that 's the kind of slide they do in the movies .
are the mods from abyss jewels also dependent on itemlevel ?
or more like the normal '' jewels where it does n't matter ?
yep you could mistake one for a flying dinosaur .
i mean technically they are flying dinosaurs but you know what i mean .
they also are not fond of kayakers as they have expressed to me on several occasions .
i collect toenail shavings and then stick them to my toenails .
then i decided to join my pet rock in hell .
i now currently reside in hell eating my toenail shaving off the burning ground .
me and my pet rock really hit it off so now were married and have 14 kids .
one of my kids is named crippling depression and ironically he suffers from ... ... cancer .
i also currently and honourably hold the position as leader of isis .
i am targeting a man named william timothy franklin .
he stands in the way of me and my ambitions as a terrorist .
i also get breastfed by my mother when she is in the mood to feel pain .
she also has no friends and weighs just 10 pounds worth of british money .
i live in a cage with a person named osama bin laden .
he just keeps repeating 911 over and over again for no reason .
i lick carbonated milk off the wall or a living .

i sleep in the ground with the trolls underground .
it 's hard to enjoy a holiday when it does n't include your favorite relaxation .
what does she have to do with discriminatory serb actions
an indirect way of suggesting you broaden your activities instead of narrowing them down to rabid hatred towards serbs .
i never got if some scientists that discovered some disease like that it 's named after them or a bit hated it .
i would n't be very comfortable knowing people would cry and get angry when they find out they got a disease named after me .
if you go down the vns3 path you might want to reach out about pricing for that many connections .
yeah the prelogon stuff is done one of 2 ways putting the config file in a magic folder that openvpn searches on boot requires user to log in before connection is made or you can add openvpn to path and set up a scheduled task to connect on boot after any interface is available .
the elephant in the room that no one is talking about is that that car is an e63s edition one .
that car arrived on shores in march/april and sat until the feds let them in in october .
i had an edition 1 the car just did n't feel right the brakes were not right compared to my s63 or c63 with ceramics ... i would bet big money a fresh out the factory car w ceramics would behave differently .
the edition 1 also handled vastly different to the 2018 wagon w ceramics that i drove .
hey guys let 's all go to bob 's and see what 's up !
do n't see him that much differently than fred vanvleet .
they are both very good at defense specifically they get steals they are great at not turning the ball over and they shoot well enough from 3 it 's clear that they exude high basketball iq .
those kinds of players are n't stars though but they will have a very positive impact on your team 's ability to win games i.e .
they will be excellent backups or above average starters who best fit with a wing scorer like butler or derozan .

do n't sit too high on your horse after a home series victory mate .
sa did n't even compete in india last time around .
instead your team kept moaning and complaining about pitches and conditions .
at least this indian team in spite of losing is n't whinging .
it seems you 're building pure damage on her meaning she will deal a ton of damage but not take a ton herself .
if you build with more tanky stats she wo n't die as quickly but also wo n't deal as much damage .
you can put some points into str or int so you can wear armor that as more physical str or magical int .
finesse has a more equal '' armor but it is much lower than str or int .
upgrade gear often ever level if you can to ensure you have the most armor you can get .
fortify or armor of frost her before the fights start .
this is what you can do to make her more tanky but i do agree with u/sarahmerigold in that if you are placing her properly she should n't get focused .
if you watch the turn order at the top and attack out of combat before it goes to the next turn it will place you at the very end so you will get a turn before others move .
then you can use the polymorph chameleon cloak the undead skill play dead or the aero spell uncanny evasion to not take damage until your next turn .
point is when the market hits a correction/recession people dump aggressive growth stocks in favor of income stocks .
so you 'll see a huge drop in a stock like facebook compared to something boring like general mills .

i do n't believe this is an electrical rc car i think it 's gas powered you can hear the tiny engine .
i have ibs-a so i have both c and d. as long as i take the probiotic as directed my visceral hypersensitivity is non-existent .
i also follow a customised long-term low fodmap diet that helps keep trigger foods out of my system .
for me the combination means my system is less sensitive and there are fewer reactions happening altogether .
i do n't know if this is it but it makes me think of the 80 's ... one foot walk the moon .
upvoted because i kinda want to read that story about the toe .
the thing is he used the same setup for nevermind but other amps were used as well such as a vox ac30 and fender bassman .
in utero was just his fender twin reverb as far as i know .
one was a pre and power amp the other was just a pre amp .
i think the manual for that one is here http mesaboogie.com/media/user 20manuals/studio_22_manual.pdf .
going on this https i.imgur.com/6nk7zf2.jpg picture it looks like it is a power base 2 as his power amp .
some people on this subreddit will tell you it 's the dark knight and while i think that 's stupid fair play to them .
there is no objective greatest movie so it 's all down to opinions .
some opinions are wrong though so it 's definitely 2001 a space odyssey
poster established the two camps frum '' vs tikkun olam ''
then goes to denigrate the followers of tikkun olam '' as unaware of the kaballistic roots .
and we can also add to that the halachic and actual meaning of the term .
then throws in a weird ultra-orthodox '' line that is non-sensical how can you be exempted spirtually from anything ?
next paragraph talks about return to that original will of our ancestors '' what is that ?
run away and worship false gods every opportunity we had pretty much all of nach .
now you are just being deliberately obtuse and distorting the true meaning of avodas hashem .
this is a throwaway few sentences meant not to enlighten but to start a troll war
maybe if you understood the post you would see its discussion value .
yep msc sucks but they 're cheap and when vendors are paying the freight it 's pretty much their call but i wo n't put my employees at risk just to unload a container .
double o was pretty bad too last i used them too but that was years ago .
we get a lot of maersk cans too and those are generally fine .

i just hope he gets 100 out before he turns 18 and is heavily encouraged to denounce his relationships with his moms .
i 'm supposed to be taking antidepressants but i 'm not .
it 's mostly about money and being able to focus on obtaining things like medicaid .
sharing hobbies in the same room can be a lot of fun .
my girlfriend will also read while i play games or she 'll enjoy watching games with a good plot with me .

he was already getting frazzled which is what we wanted .
plus what he said to the guys before the final drive seemed so deflated .
like all of this stuff is taken out of context and but i ca n't help but feel it did n't exactly fire up the troops .
this list would be dead before it casts its second creature .
it is especially good if you are n't quite sure what you want to study .
taking a few classes and deciding to change your schooling route will be a lot cheaper if that happens and you are going to a community college rather than a expensive university .
but if there are n't very good community colleges near you and you think you 're 99 sure of what you want to study then maybe do try one of the schools you want to go to .
i was about to make a joke of payet breaking his ankles ...
damn i hope he did n't get injured badly .
that 's like asking 'hey why were you stupid two years ago ? '
but in length i believed mitch 's campaign rhetoric about obstructing obama and making him a one term president was just that .
i thought surely by the end they 'd go back to talking as always that obama and mitch would meet do some grand posturing make some sort of agreement on a token issue and go on attacking each other .
i really did n't think mitch was about to pull what he pulled .
it would be a pretty shitty treatment since it already kind of is but could you theoretically try breaking the prions with radiation ?

over here in canada ps4 and xbox 1 games have risen up to 89.99 for brand new games and that 's a pretty standard price all the way around with the exception of a few developers .
this micro-transaction shit is absurd i heard someone saying that to unlock vader in battlefront 2 once all is said and done you 've invested somewhere close to 200 ... .for a video game character ... .for a game that costs damn near 100 itself ... god help us .
mind you i 'm an old school campaign gamer myself because online has too much bullshit but regardless when i do play online i do n't want to pay-to-play a game i 've already spent good money on .
with that being said though it is definitely hard these days to find a good solid solo campaign oriented game that 's long enough to enjoy with a story and plot good enough to delve into .
uncharted has done this along with the last of us more recently i 've enjoyed horizon zero dawn .
this is one reason why nintendo is still the shit .
they care about the player not their bottom line .
god bless satoru iwata and the other past and future heads of nintendo for giving a shit about us and quality gaming .
i guess the biggest piss off for me is that ps3 had free online which was awesome and no micro transactions then ps4 comes out charges 70/year and most online based games are filled with micro transactions .
i 'm sure the crazy younger folk who are mega into online spend absurd amounts of money on micro transaction whether it be their own or their parents money but i ca n't justify spending 1000 on video games in a year .
maybe i 'm just old and crazy but that 's ridiculous to me and i 'm only 28 ...

each day you can choose to hangout out with one of two friends that lead to different activities plus a couple story choices .
there 's also you can just miss certain areas or conversations if you do n't explore enough or exhaust dialogues because once a day is over after hanging out you miss everything that happens on that day .
so yes you will see new stuff but it wont lead to wildly different things happening .

what polo is doing is criminal it is fraudulent misappropriation of funds and a slew of other things .
they are way beyond the things are busy we 're trying to hire more ppl '' excuse .
they are controlling people 's money for months at a time against their will and refusing to communicate with the customers who have been giving them money and propping this place up .
polo owes everyone with an outstanding ticket an explanation as well as compensation for loss .
until they start making some efforts they can rot in jail and i 'm sure that jail is n't far off given it is a us company .
seriously how hard is it to post regular status updates announcements or a simple reply to support tickets acknowledging your wait time and a proposed timeline for getting their shit together .
there are plenty of high-dollar customers who will be filing suit i 'm not taking about the p-forum scam idiots and pressing the fbi and state ag 's to investigate and imprison the people running this shit show .

great deal for porto since they get to try out the player before committing to buying him but it 's only possible since portimonense and porto have extremely close ties .

the only reason overheating is an issue is battery degradation .
if they turned off the limiting system in a p100d you could do as many runs as you want or run the batter as hot as you like it would fuck up you battery royally tho .
there is no evidence that the roadster 2.0 demo had any extra battery cooling in effect tesla probably just turned off the battery maintenance system on 2 100 packs .

i am not saying that there is acceptance of homosexuality .
but when someone of your own is outed or comes out of the closet there definitely is ostracizing involved .
however there are n't any mobs or even a society level persecution of lgbt people .
all the town leper people beating you up etc is just fud .
there definitely are attacks on gay people like there are in the us or pretty much row except western europe but they are scattered and an aberration and not the norm .

i commend you for going off and trying your hand at creating a new web framework .
as you 've seen there will be significant backlash .
but stay true the amount of knowledge that you learn will be invaluable .
python has already a lot of web frameworks but it does n't stop people from creating new .
this is the amazing world of software development if you do n't like what is available create your own .
just be careful getting support in this specific area may prove difficult .

i wonder if all the questions in the system can always be answered correctly and confidently by whoever is filling in the form .

tolkien as far as i know was a christian anarchist like tolstoy .
so the hobbits represented pretty much what he believed in .
so i 'm not sure if this answer fits your criteria but i invest a few hours a week into researching and learning about business ideas i can start for less than 100 or easy work i can do for extra cash .
i 've made a nice side income for myself and have been able to share ideas with other people who then go on to start their own business or side hustle which is really cool for me to watch because even though i 'm not profiting from their business i get to share in their excitement and find them coming back and sharing new ideas with me .
in the past i have n't been very good about reinvesting my money but that 's something i 'm working on now .
so now my side hustle funds my investments which i consider another leg of my business

update 2.0 is coming soon with a ton of new stuff too .
familiarity damage a is around 15 as u/xzamusx said .
someone tested a and aa a few weeks ago they 're roughly 2.6 improvements in overall damage .
which is significantly better than cta a to aa to aa which was shown to only be a 0.3 improvement .
if you 're not spamming a specific skill like iai sotc moonlit snow/twin moons lumber chop tornado/spearfall/other spear skill whatever people like on kusa these days then familiarity damage is a really good star to go for in terms of general damage though it 's quite rare .
do n't know why you 'd ever run any other yellow effect besides disable parry which does n't conflict on melee weapons honestly .
equipment weight damage has diminishing returns if you put on tatenashi agility damage you can just put on ranged weapons and it affects everything .
the others are just asking to get yourself killed .
but consider the fact repeat fact that no american president will ever get locked up for crimes .
we let them resign take a blanket lifetime pardon and leave the spotlight .
bannon however could end up tripped on any of dozens of possible pesky guilty verdicts and subsequent sentences .
it could be as simple as one or more of his giant lies being done to the wrong investigators or knowing about some kushner/flynn/turkey/russia treason type stuff and not reporting it .
so let 's simplify that to say there 's about a hundred ways for bannon to lose as this progresses .
his only sure thing is a presidential pardon something you can easily get by manipulating trump .
he throws away any chance of that if he 's perceived as rolling over on trump .
it was a mistake from groen to go together with spa in the first place .

from the above linked journal of vasco da gama you can find how they collected '' some locals basically kidnapped most of them .
one person a jew https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaspar_da_gama in particular wanted to join them by his own will according to one version .
other more likely is that he was kidnapped and later even converted to christianity .
he was the source of the information and correction .
in the appendix of the same journal there are letters sent from an italian merchant staying in lisbon about the expedition .
in the first letter he relays the incorrect information about hindi being christians believing it true .
in the second he corrects it and mentions the above mentioned jewish person was the source of correction .
if you want to ask anything more specific feel free to ask

not necessarily recognized by law but recognized by mauloch it shows the union of strength of two strongholds bonding .
firstly a wife is selected by the receiving chief and a dowry sum is arranged .
a date in then set for the union generally taking place in the receivers stronghold .
then preparations are made the rings bonds of matrimony are forged and infused with the blood of the to-be-spouses .
these rings are not forged out of gold but instead of more common metals eg .
copper bronze steel to represent the virtues of the orcs independence personal austerity honour and piety .
the ceremony itself varies from stronghold to stronghold but there remains some key and fundamental components .
the giving chief hands over his daughter whilst gripping the receiving chiefs hand in a lock signifying if you dishonour her i will break you ! .
the ceremony commences with the exchanging of vows and pious sermons chanted by the shaman/wise woman to the couple and echoed by the audience in a call-response manner .
rings and exchanged on one hand and the other is cut open the blood of the couple fusing into one signifying the marriage and the new role for the wife in bearing the chief strong children .
depending on the main role of the new wife forge wife huntswife etc a gift may be presented by the chief to his new wife e.g a forging hammer or a quiver of arrows .
this is followed by hours of drinking feasting socialising and most often brawling that continues sometimes until sunrise .
then the couple retire to the longhouse to consummate the union and this is renowned for being brutal violent and unsavoury .
variations that occur include the public consummation of the union a trend common but being in the minority of cases and the initiation ceremony of the other wives accepting the new wife into their realm this often leads into a sparring combat session or wresting match which is participated unarmed and unarmoured and often totally unclothed .

i have held a very small amount of bitcoin since 2013 and have wanted to get back into crypto lately .
it would be nice to make lots of money but i am more excited about the future of crypto and want to be a part of it .
the great news for me is that i have had one problem after another getting set up with the exchanges and have n't been able to buy much .
this saved me money since i did not lose much .
a friend at work was all worked up over his litecoin losses but i explained to him that he had a sound investment strategy and wondered what happened to it .
he got excited about the past gains and ended up buying more and more as the value went down .
i have been reading up here and at several other sites but each time i find what i consider a great opportunity i can not buy it as i can not get set up .
as it stands now i am now on a couple of exchanges and have the ability to send crypto to others to invest .
i like a buy and hold strategy and have a few investments i want to make .
i have read white papers looked at profiles on each team reviewed what the distribution is and read what the team 's goal is for their technology .
based on the recent drop in values what coins ico 's tokens or other opportunities do you think are now a great buy at the lower price assuming they lost value ?
so last night i decided to add my own custom avatar .
downloaded a model from the models resource and added a few emotes with maximo .
everything seems fined and dandy until i got into game .
my pelvis seems to be messed up like it is jutting out forward .
the weird thing is that the emotes work fine ok not 100 since they kinda jump back to where you were standing and it looks weird .
on unity it showed that my pelvis and hip angle is 0.0 and should be near 180 .
was looking everywhere for help but nothing came up .
i have tripped like 7 or 8 times but only two of those trips stands out because i got crazy visuals ... and both of these times it was only one blotter and was told it was 175ug and 125ug the other time .
i felt so overwhelmed and felt like i was loosing my mind/going insane but it was awesome at the same time .
both of these times i got the same visuals of me getting intense open eyed visuals of fractals and getting lost in them .
all of the other times i have gotten intense but more of a body and mental high and not so visual..
i have only taken 1 blotter all of my trips but these ones made me wonder if it really was 125/175ug cuz it felt so intense maybe it was 300 ? ?
can anyone help with explaining this dosage cuz i want to experience that again but each time it felt like a low dose and kind of a waste of time cuz the peak lasts only like 2 hours but those two times lasted alot longer and the trips lasted exactly 12 hours .
so my question is how much does this dosage sound like ?
my whole visual field was covered with neoncoloured fractals and diamonds lmao

at first i thought it was just one of those things but enough time has passed now that it seems like they 've increased the chance of the opponent getting 2 or 3 wild cards in a single turn .
the biggest culprit is ambrose in deans daily hard .

there 's a highway i take sometimes and for a number of miles on this highway it 's 3 lanes except the leftmost lane is separated from the middle lane by a solid white line instead of a dashed white line .
this lane is accompanied by a couple of lighted signs spaced throughout the length of it that light up to denote the lane is open or the lane is closed .
the lane is open for some time before and after the two rush hour periods of the day one in the morning one in the afternoon .
when the lane is closed '' the only thing that changes about it is the lighted sign .
there 's no work being done on it nothing blocking any part of it .
it 's entirely separate from the other side of the highway going the opposite direction so it 's not like those lanes that run between the two sides that are open going one direction for one part of the day then open going the other direction for the other part of the day .
the highway has a couple toll gates on it but i ca n't fathom how having that lane open or closed would change anything about gaining more money from tolls i 'm pretty sure the lane does n't have a toll mark up if it 's used at least there 's no indication that it does .
edit i just realized my wording of when the lane is open is somewhat vague .
i meant to say the lane is open twice a day one time in the morning beginning about an hour before rush hour and ending an hour after and the second time in the afternoon/evening again beginning an hour before rush hour and ending an hour after .

did they decide their other menus which everyone liked were trash ?
pre game lobby menus are actually the worst what was wrong with the pre game lobby in the last 11 cods ?
why is the in game pause menu so different ?
its so weird and the older way was way better .
why is headquarters the first option on the weird ass menu when clearly everyone wants to go to pubs first ?
maybe if they put hq first and insist on keeping it there for whatever reason they could at least put an option that says you are now entering the hq is this ok ? ''
i 'll give it to them that the initial entrance into it is ok but why is it called the dozzier ?
also why are my guns sorted by class now instead of by kill amount ?
i 'm completely ranting but it 's small stuff like this that they changed that just doesnt make any sense to me .
i get they want to be innovative with every game they bring out but is erasing customizability really the way to do that ?

my dude is 11 months and used to take sips of water with meals from an open cup just fine with me helping him with his cup .
one day a switch flipped and for over a month now he refuses water .
i 've tried every cup out there water in the bath diluted juice in water everything .
he sees me offer the cup and he pushes it away forcefully .
i 've even tried water in the bottle and he refuses .
he is on three solid meals a day and i 'm reluctant to introduce snacks until he drinks more sips of water because he is constipated not severely but his stool is definitely not soft or easy to pass .
will this just pass and he will suddenly like water again ?
he will allow me to feed him water from a spoon bit not very much and sometimes he refuses even that .
he is formula fed so he is not getting additional water in breastmilk .

i 'm an experienced roleplayer looking to do some anime rp .
if i have n't seen it i can watch it within a decent timeframe .
some of my favorites are soul eater sword art online and my hero academia .
of course i 'm up for anything you might suggest as well i 'm very flexible and able to play either gender and a multitude of character types .
for the genre of rp i am once again flexible although i enjoy a healthy mix of slice of life combat and romance if at all possible in the situation although i understand not every rp needs or can include combat .
i like my partners to be somewhat available i understand that daily might not be possible but more than a couple posts a week is preferred .
my posts vary depending on yours but on my own i always attempt at least 1-2 paragraphs if not more .
i 'm not super picky about everything being prim and proper grammatically we all make mistakes !

tl dr component missing from pcb anyone know what it is and how i can replace it .
so after lurking around this subreddit for a while i decided to buy a keyboard kit to build that i could call my own .
with this i decided to go with a tada68 from massdrop with zealios 65g switches and an aluminium case complete with a taihao beach house keycaps from massdrop surprise surprise .
started building and soldering while drinking with flatmates stupid idea with hindsight but it 's a house of second year uni students and we 've just finished january exams .
i end up dropping a screw tip out of sight ask for help looking for it since i 'm a lazy shit and i was n't going to get up for anything .
flatmate bumps in to me and finds the screw under my bed but not before knocking my hand which was holding the pcb into the bed frame .
i figured nothing was broken after a brief inspection and carried on .
as the night progressed some of us went to our rooms while others left for the club .
i finished up soldering and decided to launch up a key tester and see if it was working .
that 's when i discovered the plus/equals key was n't working .
i looked at the board though to myself hmm maybe this is a faulty switch .
so replaced the switch but to no avail as it still was n't functional .
looked at the pcb once more playing spot the difference between this switch and the next and saw that one black bar was missing .
seems like a diode or resistor of some sort had made it 's way into freedom and as the floors were carpet i 'd have a better chance at winning the lottery than finding it .
since i 'm doing electrical engineering at uni and i know stuff so i tell myself i though how hard could this be so i do what i normally doing for problems and tried googling for answers .
looked like a resistor but only has 2 colour bands not the standard 4 .
this is what the pcb component looks like currently .
https imgur.com/37op7ii if anyone could lead me in the right direction it would be much appreciated .
or just tell me that it 's unfixable and that i should just get a new pcb .
i had almost made it to 30 days when i had to reset my counter though truthfully i did look at her social media many times in that time period so technically i probably should have reset it sooner .
she texted me on friday night asking if it was too soon to check in .
previously she had texted me a handful of times and emailed me restating that she did n't want to break up completely but just wanted a break from our relationship which i did not want and had made clear that i did n't want that .
then on nye when i was feeling wistful though not drunk or high as i 've been sober for a month small win i unblocked her number .
i decided that if she reached out i would want to know .
she texted me at nearly midnight on friday night we both live in the same time zone/city .
i figure she probably thought i would be out with friends probably drunk probably weak .
the next day i drafted a text telling her that i did n't feel we shared trust honesty or respect in our relationship and that i did n't think we could build that in a friendship .
i told her i did n't want to check in but that i wish her well .
i felt good knowing that i trusted myself and my instincts to say what i really wanted and to enforce that boundary .
i am going about my daily life and functioning now better than i have in months our end was very messy emotional and taxing .
it affected my work and relationships across the board .
i 'm reconnecting with friends and forming new friendships with my time .
and the text just lingers in the back of my mind .
i miss that familiarity and in some moments when i let my mind wander i still think of what-ifs .
i do n't know why i ca n't bring myself to do it .
i 'm looking to find a method if possible to consistently hit 1 lp of damage with my lvl 3 account .
i 'm trying to reflect/poison/bn kalphite queen kills on my skiller but bosses work differently in that you need to do at least 1 lp of actual damage to get the drop .
doing such low damage awards the drop but no xp .
currently brewing down and using fun weapons ranged or mage only the second phase protects against melee still hits anywhere from 29 lp dmg to 159 lp dmg which is still too much .
if anyone can figure out a way to consistently deal only 1 lp of damage i 'd be happy to award that person 100m .
waiting til kq is low hp recoiling it down to less than 10 lp letting it heal to 11 lp recoiling 10 and then dealing 1 lp of damage with a weapon kq hits too high and will often ko herself with recoils
i have multiple independent networks mostly running dell supported workstations on a domain that need bios updates .
touching every pc one by one is a last resort .
is there a way for me to update the bios on these machines in a remote fashion silent or not ?
even if i had to identify models and grab bios update exe files and push them by hand that would be preferable to hitting every client manually .
i just do n't know how to go about this so if anyone has any pointers i would appreciate it .
i purchased too many contracts to cover the underlying .
bought calls to open with a 105 strike and expiration of 1/19 in two days .
it 's not on a tear or anything just thinking worst case scenario .
i 'm a margined labeled day trader well above 25000 .
please be kind to me as i let an extra 0 pass through the trade confirmation .
my fear is that the underlying magically pops and expires itm .
i have enough margin to flip the 10 but not the 100 .
my broker auto exercises unless i call on expire date .
if it goes itm i 'd rather not exercise and eat the premium .
i have an order to sell all at market price incase it starts trading .
also i thought i had to come up with at least 50 of the underlying to flip it to avoid a violation .

i 've never really played with tasker but after some googling it seems to be how i would accomplish this .
from what i can tell to get smart things to integrate with tasker i have to go through sharp tools .
so i linked my devices to sharp tools and then created a new task using the sharp tools plug in to get the status of smart things .
the problem arises when i try to use the klwp plug in to send the variable .
i 've tried a million different ways to get a variable sent from tasker to klwp but all i 'm getting back is null .
i 've tried googling for an answer or any situation similar to this but nothing is coming up .
i 'm at a loss and do n't get why this is so difficult for me to accomplish .
on the klwp tasker plug in i set the tasker string to st_shm with the customer variable shm .
then in klwp i created a text module with tasker shm .
i 've tried it with different variables and without the space but all i get is 'err null ' in response .
any help is appreciated and i can provide more info if needed .
once again i 'm completely new to tasker so its probably an easy mistake i 'm making .

i 'm new to this whole relationship thing and have been seeing this girl d '' for just under two weeks .
to fully understand the issue some background is needed .
d '' is best friends with a '' who is engaged to my best friend .
in the past a '' set up a date between d '' and another close friend .
they hooked up for a night it did n't go well and never went beyond that .
just prior to me and d '' s first date i was made aware of this and i told her i had no issues with it since it was n't something serious and everyone has a past .
suffice to say the date went great second date went great and it became official '' by the third date .
for both of us this does n't feel or act like a two week relationship .
we 've both shared a lot of incredibly private things are on the same wavelenght '' and honestly thing are looking great and despite it being fast i really want to take it at her pace not to screw this up .
d '' has a pretty high libido which i 'm totally in to .
even if my little guy ca n't always keep up i 'm more than happy to lend a hand and love seeing and feeling her finish .
now i told her something i probably should n't a few hour before things heated up .
i told her my friend jokingly called her a nympho in our discussion and that pissed her off because he does n't even get to know that after what happened that one night ''
i told her i 'm well aware she 's been completely open on what happened and let 's say my friends apparently has an issue with premature ejaculation .
i told her it was a guy thing and him trying to restore some male ego he might feel is bruised .
and i thought that was the end of it .
throughout the encounter she asks why i 'm smiling .
i tell her i 'm just happy and like seeing her in that state .
she orgasms and starts laughing i ask her whats so funny and she says that i 'm probably agreeing with my friend right now .
i 'll be honest in that moment i was hurt because not only did she feel like she was thinking about him while with me but that she thought i was thinking about something so stupid .
i got annoyed and told her it 's stupid for that to come up at that time and to fuck off '' .
turned her back to me and would n't talk .
after a few minutes of just lying there i forced her to face me and talk .
she said that she did n't think it could work out because she should n't be putting so much though in to what my friend said '' and that i 'm free to fuck off '' .
i apologized and told her i 'm not going anywhere because of one stupid thing said between us or because of one hook up a couple months before we met .
we ended up making up talked quite a bit more about other stuff and ended up having sex again before going to sleep .
what 's still bothering me is n't what she said but rather what happened after .
she just shut down and would n't talk until i felt like i forced her to .
not just that but her immediate opinion was this would n't work '' .
thing is i know whe 's had some fucked up relationships and has been deeply hurt in the past and the notion of the door is right there if you want to run '' has come up ending every time with i 'm not running anywhere '' .
i feel like i want to raise this issue with her because
i do n't want her to shut down at the smallest confrontation
the thing that 's bothering me most is that she was so willing to just go to sleep angry with an issue unresolved .

so i am getting the copper iud but i tend to have horrible cramps when not on birth control so i am concerned about having horrendous cramps on the copper iud .
i do want to try being off hormones for a few months if i can and potentially go back to the pill or patch to regulate myself im very irregular always have been or if the pain becomes too much .
would my insurance cover me having the pills or patch whilst knowing i have the copper iud ?
i 'd go for the mirena but i like to be in control of being regular and i guess the added protection of both pill and iud makes me happier .

i 'm just getting back into school after taking some time off and i 'm having some trouble in my physics class .
i 'm hoping to get some help here so that i can get on top of things and understand what i 'm doing .
so the problem i have is that my professor wants us to write theory on a ball rolling down a ramp and then rolling off of a table .
the purpose is to find where the ball will land .
the end of the ramp is parallel to the table .
all variables are unspecified and we can use 10m/s^2 for gravity .
i got as far as finding the gpe and using the law of energy conservation and then using that to find the initial horizontal velocity .
if someone can help me solve this you 'd be a lifesaver !
i thought it might be lana rhoades but it is n't the tits are bigger .

i think being able to double zhonyas is sort of a dumb mechanic in the game but what do you guys think ?
from everything i have read it will not hit exchanges .
the devs have no interest in getting the coin s to exchanges and it will happen only if one of the bigger token holders makes it happen .
basically the only use for the token is to buy their games within their portal .
this is a hard pass for me as i do n't play angry birds ripoffs and there are much better icos coming down the line that want to see their users grow and prosper .
do not buy this ico unless you like playing the silly little games on their platform .
i recently began shooting raw and am aware of all the benefits .
my problem is that i only need these benefits for the 5 of my photos that i actually edit .
for the rest i would prefer to either delete or downgrade to jpg .
ideally i would go through my photos white flag the raws i want to keep black flag the photos i want to delete and leave unflagged the photos i want to compress to jpg .
from what i can tell the only way to do this is to export the ones i want to compress and then go into file explorer and delete the raws .
this is a problem because i would lose all of the organization that i did in lightroom with the flags and may end up deleting one of the raws that i did n't export and want to save .

i completed my undergraduate degree in business a double major of supply chain management and marketing in december of 2016 .
since then i had a marketing internship took a few non-degree graduate business courses at the university where i did my undergrad and started my full-time job in june .
i wanted to start my mba this semester at that same university but was told that i need two years of post-grad work experience and could not start until january 2019 .
i do n't really like my current job and was hoping that an mba would help me be a bit more marketable as i try to find something else .
i want to get my advanced degree while i 'm closer to academia and still remember how to study and write academic papers and really be a student .
also i live and work very close to where i did my undergrad as i was hoping to be able to easily get my mba there on campus after work .
so waiting until 2019 means i 'd have to stay in that area and most likely in my current role until then as i 'm not qualified for a lot of the other positions i 've been looking at in the area .
so i want to apply to another institution online and start asap .
i 'd have to take my gre gmat will take too long really soon like maybe this weekend or next week and would absolutely be rushing .
i was n't planning on taking it because my undergraduate institution was most likely going to waive it for me .
should i just wait until the spring semester and space out my application process ?
then the argument could be made that i should just wait another semester and stay at my undergraduate institution .
i think my undergraduate institution is a bit more prestigious versus the online school lehigh university vs. penn state but not by a lot .
do i hurry up and try to get in now or should i suck it up and wait until 2019 ?
or do i go with the middle ground and apply to the online program in march ?
or am i going about this all wrong and i 'm getting my mba too soon ?
i just have no idea what the right move is here .
hello and welcome to watch where i take a look at the coming banner and provide some of my opinions on the units how they can be used and general thoughts on whether the units and their tmrs are worth your hard-earned resources .
the second ffxii banner graces us with balthier replacing gabranth probably due to how much gabranth despises basch or maybe because balthier was heavily delayed and we have to put him somewhere .
here we have a finisher a cover tank and ... other units .
note that this rating is based only on the unit without their 7-star status .
this is because 7-stars are so far out in gl giving us a lot of content where you have to use the current set of units and because we 've had a number of units modified as they move to gl and thus i fully expect gl 7-stars to be different in some ways .
a really a great unit that will help you clear content well
b a unit with some situational usefulness but with some missed opportunities or outdated stats/abilities
c a unit that may come off the bench under very specific circumstances to the point where you probably will forget to raise them up in the first place
d a unit that will still be just ok '' even if loaded up with the best tmrs .
with a base hp of 4038 when potted and an atk of 189 he 's respectable in terms of comparing to the existing pool of damage dealers .
he gets a slight boost to his def and hp both at 20 taking that hp up to 4845 and also comes with a conditional atk boost of 80 as long as he 's wielding a gun which is fantastic .
he also has an innate physical and magic dodge not much but 15 and is immune to paralyze confuse and petrify leaving only sleep as an ailment to take him out of the action and generally not an issue .
his equipment options are n't huge but they do the job in addition to guns we 've got knives swords katanas bows and spears .
given that we have a good variety of high-attack spears and katanas available it 's highly likely that you 'll use those for building him out unless you like the flavor of also giving him a crossbow thanks to tinkererbow .
his armor options are much more limited with only hats clothes and light armor but you should farm up apron dress for him anyway !
for abilities you wo n't use there 's rapid fire which generally only appears as an annoyance in arena and then weapon and shield break offering a 40 atk or def break respectively along with a little damage .
if you have no other breaker on your party hey 40 is fine .
his main set of abilities is similar to veritas of the flame with moves that imperil and imbue an element .
they were literally the same other than covering different elements but all elements but light got their imperil buffed up by 10 .
i guess ice is really the odd element out between these two .
and sorry all you guys with light-heavy teams you 're not going to get an extra boost from balthier .
given that balthier is either going to be run w/o elements or with sparky his gun or olive 's gun if you 're looking for high attack this is probably fine the light imperil crew tends to bring their own imperils more readily anyway .
then he has heavy stomp~~**killer shot a 5x move .
and he has a 30 chance of countering physical or magic damage with uplift~~mark which unlocks full charge stomp~~**finishing blow .
but wait we have a gl exclusive boost here !
killer shot now unlocks finishing blow which is a significant boost to balthier .
of particular interest for those with olive you can put sparky on balthier to give him innate lightning element allowing him to rotate between his 5x and 10x move an average of 7.5x without spending a turn imbuing an element .
this of course would rely on an outside imperil to maximize damage but as balthier hits after guromu we have access to high-damage lightning greatswords .
such a setup also more readily opens the door to knight delita owners or users running 2b .
of course if you only have balthier he still brings excellent elemental finishing thanks to the change to killer shot .
by spending turn 1 imbuing an element turn 2 4 with killer shot and turn 3 5 with finishing blow that averages out to a 5 turn modifier of 10.2 i think per turn as long as you 're using the 60 imperil elements .
of course there 's nothing saying you have to match all your elements by bringing his own imbue imperil balthier can easily fit on mixed-element teams since as a finisher he 's not going to add to any chain counts etc .
he has an lb too but it 's your pretty standard 7.8x aoe damage when maxed out 5.2x to start .
summary an elemental finisher balthier would have been a gun-based veritas of the flame with a few key changes if not for his global buffs .
the increase in his imperils to 60 for 3/4 of his elements is a solid upgrade but the big winner is the change for his finishing blow .
by having it be reliably available balthier is able to hit high amounts of damage consistently for mid-length or long fights .
what 's more he 's not limited in weapons having access to his own gun sparky and machine gun all with high atk stats .
veritas of the flame obviously these two units are very similar .
votf has no good axe equipment though so the fact that he can equip fixed dice is where most of the similarities in actual damage come into play .
cg lasswell high modifiers some setup ability to use different elements .
there 's no need to worry about imbued elements and similarly his changes in gl make it easier for him to hit big numbers across a couple common elements .
as a finisher this also means that other comparable units can be found by looking at last week 's banner review .
an excellent gun but this is primarily for balthier due to the fact that there 's no gun mastery materia and otherwise you 'd have to use apron dress to get a boost from guns .
there are other non-elemental weapons that are more commonly useful but this is of course one of the bis options for balthier .
so if you pull him you should farm this for him it lets him equip anything else '' in the offhand .
if you have tdh stuff farmed up you can instead consider machine gun .
cover tank breaker a zodiac escutcheon heavy shield def+60 spr+70 lightning resistance 50 and 10 evade a
well i bet ondore 's feeling pretty stupid right now because clearly basch is right here .
unless being a vision means you 're dead in which case ... maybe ondore was right ?
what makes me doubly happy is that basch is far more straightforward of a unit compared to the last few banners having a good set of useful abilities and not setting up a cascading basket of dominoes counted all at once .
you can think of him at a very basic level of being a 5-star version of warrior of light with some mystea thrown in .
great potted hp of 4135 and his def and spr are 185 and 166 respectively both very useful for his skillset although tilted towards soaking up physical damage .
basch 's potted attack of 158 hampers his ability to deal damage in a real way though .
his equipment set is very broad essentially he ca n't equip whips and harps .
for innate attributes he 's got undead killer meh a 30 spr and def boost a 20 hp boost auto-refresh and a conditional 20 hp/def/spr as long as he 's holding a shield .
he can also counter although his counters are only for himself for physical attacks he can recover his hp up to two times a hard limit per turn and for magic he can recover 50mp limited to once per turn .
ok well basch does have commander 's order's a solid 5 turn 70 def/spr buff .
as for the bread butter of basch his skillset is split into two parts breaking and covering .
so you can sacrifice aoe and some versatility in covering two stats by instead doing a long and slightly stronger break against a single stat .
for covering both abilities last 3 turns have a 75 chance to trigger which in reality is much higher as it counts each ally and mitigates between 50-70 of the damage received .
twilight guard covers magic damage while dawn guard covers physical damage .
no provoke here and no party support other than the spr/def buff .
his lb is his sole source of doing any real damage and it 's likely not worth leveling up it goes from an 8.6x st attack to an 11x st attack and also gives him a 3-level mirage that lasts for 3 turns .
as he 's not really a damage dealer and has no innate atk boosts this is primarily for adding mirage which well ...
summary if you have been using warrior of light and you pull basch well sorry i think he 's been replaced .
the only thing that wol kind of has over him is his innate provoke .
basch 's breaks are high quality and the right kind '' being either offensive or defensive and can be slightly stronger if you 're ok focusing on single stats them up .
otherwise when it comes to covering the party basch 's higher base stats and ability to equip essentially the same stuff as wol means that you 've likely found his replacement .
although you 're likely to build basch depending on whether you want him to cover mag or phys damage this means you can more readily just plan to bring him to whatever fight you want .
warrior of light a souped up wol without provoke .
if you 're running an enhanced wol and are happy with his level of service you probably wo n't feel a strong need to pull for basch .
the magic coverage is the key difference of course .
mystea mystea is still great if you only need magic cover thanks to her support kit .
since she can throw up resistance to ailments or stop already her support kit is better than basch .
plus her lb is world 's better again helping the rest of the party significantly .
importantly since you ca n't have party cover trigger for both types of damage at the same time the existing setup of mystea for magic coverage and a provoke tank for physical damage still holds .
basch can replace mystea here but as his support kit is n't as strong mystea is still very relevant .
gladiolus gladiolus is more damage focused and has better atk stats to better utilize said damage .
for physical cover he provides essentially the same coverage the odds are slightly lower to trigger but as it evaluates per unit the difference between 50 and 75 is not great .
instead of magic coverage gladdy can selectively cover another unit 100 nullifying damage against that unit for the turn and his lb is also damage-based but includes a provoke .
no breaks though and no magic coverage other than his st cover .
basically an improved shield of the empire '' here we have a very high def/spr boost fantastic lightning resistance and a 10 evade .
if you 're using such shields very solid tmr .
if you have wilhelm and already farmed shield of the empire the improvement here is obviously the ease of improving an evade build and the elemental resistance is perhaps enough to warrant farming it up .
same with gladdy 's shield really all these heavy shields are high quality .
and of course do n't forget about pairing it with charlotte 's tmr on support units .
the only female judge drace feels sort of like ... a mage zargabaath .
stats-wise she 's surprisingly bulky hitting 4037 hp potted up and with a 10 boost getting her up to 4440 .
her other stats are middling but mag gets up to 175 with an innate 20 boost plus an extra 30 if you slap a sword on her .
she has no way to passively restore her mp so the 10 mp boost she gets helps a little but she definitely needs a way to restore her mp if you 're going to run with her .
her crisis buff is meh since she 's not going to tank or physically attack .
but hey recovery items do double recovery when she uses them thanks to pharmacology !
partly support drace has an aoe 45 spr buff with an mp refresh attached to it in noble mind and it that will tick about 15mp per turn .
for hp/def tactical guard a similar 45 buff and will restore about 1700 per turn or so with a reasonable build on her .
both last 4 turns so while the buff is meh the refresh/regen is respectable .
she can throw up a 70 dark resistance via dark barrier which is very situational but very strong considering not many other units have dark resistance buffs at that level .
also if one of your units is stopped she can remove it unless she herself is stopped via free motion .
achilles lets her randomly imperil a pair of elements against a single target for 2 turns at 30 .
this is basically worthless even if it was n't random elements the level of imperil is too low to make an impact .
you can craft that and it 's 20 for all elements at once !
or use it on one of the three espers that learns it !
for damage we 've got revolt a 4x cover ignoring aoe magic attack that has 6 hits in 24-fr .
non-elemental so the chains wo n't be great but they 're wide enough to get boosted in other chains ?
then there 's a non-elemental st finishing move that is n't strong enough to actually finish well in rapier and then a 4.2x aoe fire magic attack flamephant also a finishing move .
for plain spells there 's firaga curaja~~curaga thundaga and blizzaga all outdated from a damage perspective and healing honestly .
it 's an aoe 3 turn 100 mag/spr buff aoe 3 turn 20 damage mitigation .
the mitigation does n't increase but the buff does .
ok that 's decent but as an lb it 's also unreliable .
summary she has a good tmr if you want mag swords .
otherwise her buffs modifiers and abilities are too disparate and do n't really mesh well .
i get that 4-star units are not going to be as strong as 5-star units but considering that zargabaath has been with us for half a year and has a similar physical-based kit and is far better for support damage drace is ... bad .
seriously though it 's 16 mag better than sorcery with an mp boost .
still not as good as fryevia 's needle but more accessible .
apparently it 's far easier to pull and play as bad guys in ffbe compared to the heroes .
perhaps fittingly playing a team of villains would get your work cut out for you too .
vayne 's got pretty solid hp at 4060 potted with an 20 boost that also boosts his atk and mag the same .
so his final hp is 4872 but his atk and mag need a lot more work his atk is a mere 164 potted out and that 20 boost is all you get .
since he has 1 hybrid move i guess i should also mention that his mag is sad at a mere 159 .
he is immune to silence and confusion though comes with an innate 20 light resistance and gets a further hp and mp boost if you put a knuckle on him so in reality his hp would be around 5481 .
dualcast lets him cast his spells twice as expected we 've got bravery faith esuna dispelga firaga thundaga and holy .
he has a couple moderate buffs exceptional tactics and enlightenment the first covering def and spr with a tiny regen attached and the second covering atk/mag with a high tide .
both are only 45 with the first doing def/spr and the other doing atk/mag but those numbers are very outdated especially coming the day after ramza gets enhanced ! .
the lb boost is thus the only really useful thing here although it 's very expensive from an mp perspective 57 ! .
he has a couple attacks ready to go with pummel providing a st 3x attack with a chance to confuse and force of will doing 2.3x and aoe .
force of will has strange frames though so it really is n't a good chaining option maybe if you pull two vaynes and decide to level them to max for the event ?
the first magick barrier grants 25 magic damage mitigation plus makes the target immune to spr breaks to ... further mitigate i guess and unlocks ascension while the other force barrier does 25 physical and immune to def breaks and unlocks divine sword .
that first unlock ascension is an 8x 12 hit hybrid atttack that includes a 90 atk/mag buff for the party while the other divine sword is a 3.6x crit physical attack that 's innately light damage and a 50 light imperil .
note that a guaranteed crit is a boosted 50 damage so it functions like an everything killer . ''
only downside on both of those moves is that they require an unlock skill that is ... just ok and the amount of damage they do does n't warrant wasting a turn .
summary a holy brawler or monk with a pair of setup moves he 's well ... well paired with drace in the mediocre department .
situationally he 's more useful due to the damage mitigation which would stack with the more general damage mitigation while still unlocking moves that are worthwhile from a damage perspective .
his stats though make him difficult to build up to do any real damage .
hardly more useful than some free event tmrs this materia is too spread in the stats it covers and ends up not being worth farming .
for damage dealers this is only slightly better than shera 's tmr and only on the hp front .
what 's more i 'd say it 's simply worse than sozhe 's tmr .
the number of units that require both atk and mag is slim to the point that a 15 boost is likely not worthwhile .
it 's marginally useful if you need to beef up your mages without completely gimping their mag stat but now we have a plethora of tanking options to protect your squishy mages .
honestly i 'm surprised that the unit is better than the tmr .
larsa 's stats are bad as he only goes to 5 stars but has a surprisingly decent support kit .
his moves are all fixed '' including his restorative ones .
from a damage perspective this means you can ignore trying to boost up his relevant stats because he can cover fire ice and lightning via 3 separate abilites that each do 2400 fixed aoe damage .
otherwise he has entrust and with such a small lb gauge it 's highly likely his will be full compared to other units a fixed 20mp restore fixed 2000 hp recovery a renamed esuna as an ability raise as an ability 30 hp and then an unlock move that grants him an aoe 2000 hp heal an esunaga a universal reflect '' that applies to the first attack received and then a slots '' style ability which randomly restores hp or mp or both or maybe even an aoe raise mixed in .
not great to be random but if you bring him for his st fixed restorative moves you can take a break and then take a chance .
his lb is similar to rosa 's a 40-59 hp restore with a 20mp/turn refresh over 3 turns .
with a cost of 16 ls it should be available pretty readily .
all in all this means you could actually run larsa on some more challenging content and not think that was a bad idea . ''
or if things go south doing a lgd run this event he can probably help out as long as you 're ok putting some sacred crystals into him .
at least you 'll find him more useful than his bad tmr .
a middling spr boost a forgettable hp boost and regen which is useless other than obscuring any units behind the unit with the regen icon .
despite both balthier and basch being good the banner overall is kind of meh .
the 4-star slots are both held by pretty bad units with tmrs that are either minor improvements over other tmrs or simply bad .
bathier is another finisher that 's easier to use and gear compared to fire veritas and can bring common imperils to better suit a party with him always helpful for a finisher .
basch is cover tank supreme but against break-proof bosses he 's not doing anything you ca n't do with 4-star units .

i have exhausted my ideas on the circulatory system activities .
but all of north alabama pretty much got shut down this week and i need to do a neat activity for friday as a review .
so last year was my first year at lolla and holy crap it was amazing .

as title says pls dont go further if you do increase it besides that lower the speed and increase the reset time of the recoil a little bit pls !
have to switch to your weapon and pick axe multiple times to get your weapon to actually work .
i 'm attempting to avoid spoilers in the title but you can probably guess this post is about what might happen to cinder in the future but also it is about the fall maiden powers and what might happen to them .
let 's start with the obvious cinder alive or dead ?
if this is the end of cinder for good or if she manages to survive and return .
as long as she does n't pop up out of the pit in the finale to keep fighting like some people think as i feel it would kind of cheapen that whole big fight scene .
cinder has become a more and more interesting villain over the last two volumes and i would n't mind more of her .
of course being taken down with a suitably epic fight scene and having failed utterly is a pretty fitting end the same way roman 's was as much as it pains me to say it .
depending on how they do it i would be satisfied either way .
of course if she is dead that leaves the issue with the powers .
right off the bat i want to say that i think it is important that salem remains in control of the fall maiden .
going back to beacon needs to be an event and if it just ends up as cool the fall maiden is on our side now beacon 's good to go '' is pretty unsatisfying .
so the powers would hopefully to go another villain or at least some third party that salem can get her hands back on .
as for likely candidates on all fronts we know cinder thinks of ruby a lot but given how maidens and silver eye warriors seem to interact i would be surprised if one person could be both .
emerald is also a good candidate as the only remaining female villain .
there 's not really any one else that cinder would be thinking of as she dies which means the power will be random .
so if one of the existing characters gets the powers from that it 's too much of coincidence to be believable
a few other things that are interesting point out the line about aura not protecting grimm parts of people .
it never comes up again in the fight and it would n't be included if it was n't going to continue to be relevant later on .
of course that does n't necessarily tell us anything about cinder 's fate since there is another villain currently in need of a new appendage .
also what cinder says about the last maiden trusting raven is ... .weird especially given the random nature of maiden transfer .
the only thing that makes sense is that it seems to be implying something about summer and since she was also a sew again that seems ... .weird .
anyway i 'd be interested in hearing y'alls thoughts on cinder and the fall maiden powers
multiply a particular number and replace it with the result
so for example i want it to search for a string called test x '' where x can be any number and then replace the x with x*2 .
file 1 has test 4 '' and i want it to multiply the 4 by 2 to get 8 .
file 2 has test 2 '' and i want it to multiple the 2 by 2 to get 4 .
so on so forth for every file within a folder .
does anyone know a software that can do that ?
background i 'm 26 main issues are hormonal acne redness dullness pih and texture .
i have combination skin that has been more dry in the winter but typically am more oily in my t-zone .
currently have a dry patch on my forehead that seems nice and smooth and moisturized until i put foundation and powder on and then it looks all flaky and gross .
i 've been on spiro antibiotics have used retinols differin antibiotic lotions epiduo etc .
my acne has never changed better or worse on hormonal bc been on the pill the shot and i currently have the skyla iud
either aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer or kiehl 's ultra facial moisturizer
cleanse with philosophy purity cleanser with a foreo luna 2 for sensitive skin
every other day to glycolic acid 7 toning solution rotated with to granactive retinoid 2 in squalane
either cerave moisturizing cream or kiehl 's ultra facial moisturizer but i plan to repurchase belif the true cream aqua bomb and use that consistently
it took a lot of trial and error to figure out the order that i use now as all of the to products except for ga toner are categorized as before oils/creams and i was told something different by their customer service from what i read on here when i was researching these products .
i moved the niacinamide to my morning routine because no matter what order i put it on it would pill horribly with my pm routine .
my skin does feel a lot smoother but for the past two months i 've still been getting new breakouts although they definitely clear up much faster .
i started whole30 9 days ago and have n't had a new pimple since then so i think that 's 100 from the drastic change in my diet .
but i 'm still seeing redness some texture pih and dull skin .
every once in awhile my skin looks nice and glowy when i get up in the morning but not consistently .
should i change the order or stop using any of these products ?
is there a different product i should incorporate into my routine ?
is 2 months long enough to decide a routine is n't giving me the results i want ?
hi guys some mail servers will always respond mailbox exists '' .

tbh i think the new weapons are fine if we get more defensive out play mechanics via movement .
crouch spamming was an issue in the past because of spraying but as we can see with this update spraying has faded hard .
with how easy it is to 2 tap people or get 2tapped we need more mechanics to defend ourselves .
bringing back the old crouch mechanics would do just that .
i also think they should re add drop shotting and seat swapping as well as adding new mechanics like jump shotting rolling diving walking for silent footsteps and climbing .
with more movement mechanics this is where the out play skill gap should be
draymond does n't average 20 ppg so there 's a lot of he 's only good cause he 's on the warriors ppl out there as if it 's easy to be the best defensive player in the nba
hey we should sticky this with the title optimal play advice .
in another subreddit one of the core developers described it as follows
the prototype is being verified at the moment but the theory goes that you can lock dogecoins on the dogecoin blockchain and be issued a matching number of ethereum-doge lets call them edoge on the ethereum chain .
that 's not that impressive proof of burn has been around for ages .
however you can later sacrifice the edoge and reclaim the original chain doge making it a two way bridge .
that 's the magic part and it means the value of the two tokens original doge and edoge should stay more or less in sync as much as anything does anyway .
this is useful to doge because it lets you use dogecoins with ethereum contracts and useful to ethereum because it gives it a stabler currency base inflationary economics tends to hold the dogecoin price stable although less true recently . ''
to be fair the agency that processes them is incredibly backlogged .
i just got my basic security clearance in november when i applied in february .

i adamantly only bought slouchy cozy sweaters and now i 'm hating half of my clothes because i want more structure .
i am somehow dragging a pair of 15 payless flats to their slow painful death day by day .
now i just ca n't find any flats i like that are n't outrageously expensive or have some stupid string bow on them .
i also wish i had bought almond toe flats i really love how they look but i just would n't buy them .
if i had known that my go-to comfortable confident outfit would consist of gray black and tan i would n't have wasted money and time buying sweaters in all colors .
i make myself wear them and i hate it because it does n't feel like me .
also ... why do n't i have a solid white shirt ?
i have all these patterns i never wear when i need solid colors .
i accessorize with jewelry and makeup not patterns really and i find myself getting frustrated by my closet .
i hunted down big bright chunky necklaces in all the colors of the rainbow because pinterest and wore them each maybe once or twice .
i have about three that are in any kind of regular rotation .
i prefer long necklaces big rings and daintier pieces .
why did no one tell me about ponte leggings ? ?
thicker than regular ones so comfy do n't rise up or scoot down and somehow looks way nicer .
finally and perhaps most ridiculously i 'd go back and buy straight basics .
i mean good thick winter socks good undies and a few well-fitting and classic bras .
we get nasty winters here and i neglected to get good socks .
i 'm always adjusting undies why do i put myself through this seriously what are some good comfy undies that do n't bunch up or roll down ? ?
i 'm this close to buying a hanes 5 pack of beige high waists and calling it done .

i work as a paralegal for a personal injury firm that hardly makes me an expert but i think you 're out of place lecturing me .
i do n't think you understand the extent of the actual cost of injuries a broken limb is serious and so is hypothermia .
pain and suffering alone entitles them to a sizable sum from a totally avoidable and potentially traumatizing accident .
broken limbs can result in permanent injury whether it 's loss of use or constant pain or recurring pain permanency entitles people to far more .
100,000 per is frankly pretty low all things considered but again i do n't have details and neither do you .
but for such a situation it is far from unreasonable as you suggest .
i 'm so sorry for what you 're going through and wish i had an answer for you .
i 'm glad you 're going there so you have some support but it must be so painful .

it leads him to the room where the portal used to be .
it still looks kind of tentacle-y and gross but is obviously dead and not illuminated like usual .
he goes up reaches his hand out to touch it just like shepherd and hopper have both done in the past and a small crack appears in front of him and mind flayer smoke starts rushing out and filling him up .

tacking on to this one of the reasons that these sorts of chinese titles can come off as seeming overly elaborate '' is because sometimes they do n't have a perfect '' corollary in english and also because of the translational difficulties of rendering the term 's meaning without it sounding like broken engrish in the process .
chinese does n't use much in the way of articles like of '' or the '' ... so lu bu 's title is simply 奮威將軍 fènwēi jiāngjūn which rolls off the tongue quite a bit easier the general of vehement might . ''
one could also argue that it could be translated as as something more familiar '' like generalissimo '' or highlord-general '' ... though of course in so doing you do lose some of the particular meanings and flavor '' of the title .
on the other hand as u/japekai stated is general of vehement might really more elaborate than say master chief petty officer of the coast guard reserve force ?

there is n't a far-right group in france that she does n't support .

my philosophy with my kids was i 'd rather be confided in than lied to . ''
i ended up knowing a few rather uncomfortable things about my daughter 's friends but since they could n't talk to their own parents at least they had me to listen .
i also found that my best weapon was n't to just put my foot down and say no . ''
that only leads to resentful compliance or outright rebellion and nothing gets learned .
so when i wanted to say no and the circumstances around the issue also pointed to no i would just say i trust your judgment and leave it at that .
sometimes i 'd embellish it a little like the time she asked me if she could skip school to help a friend do something her report card had been pretty bad and she was trying to bring the grades up so i thought about it for a minute then said well you know better than i do where you stand with getting caught up .
you want to trust the judgment but you also want to give the judgment as much support as you can to get it right

it 's just a jumbled mess of apps no real organization .

maybe any large place untouched by humanity in lasting ways ?
i 'd say it work on a boat you 're scanning the water but a farm ?
if this is like a huge plantation with rows and rows of corn or something i 'd say no .
if it was a small farm where the outsides of it are mostly forests maybe .
would go with no for a mine as it is n't 'natural ' .
i think this would be something dms have to write guidelines for would n't be too hard and rulings at the table would n't slow things too far but i think the author should word it better .
i do like effects that are 'favored terrain ' but broader so they do n't suck when you decide to leave the forest/wherever you are good at .

you can go samurai for free wis proficiency at level 7 if you want both wis and cha saves .
well i 'm actually more into the sailboats so i agree sailboats can definitely be cheaper .
sailboats are cheaper ownership-wise primarily because of the fuel usage difference .
one trip on a powerboat can exceed the fuel cost of a sailboat for the entire season .
my double engine example applies to 40 foot sailing catamarans but monohulls have one engine so that 's a savings too .
sailboats do have the added cost of sails to maintain which are cheap till they rip and you 're out several thousands of dollars .
better keep an eye on your rigging too those cracks a layman wo n't see will cost you if you demast .
rigging is also several thousand to replace and should be replaced every 10 years at least if your gon na be on the ocean .
there 's also halyards and sheets to buy and maintain not that you 're replacing them too terribly frequently .
maybe you live somewhere with an incredible second hand boat market but i suspect you 're looking at boats you do n't know are junk .
a cheap hull is not a cheap boat even if the inside still looks nice .
you can get very nice boats for 15k no doubt but calling a 40 ' 15k boat luxurious '' makes me think you need to take a closer look .
if you 're seriously considering this i think you should adjust your expectations .
but you can turn usdt into eth and then eth into fiat ?

with 21k plat you can pretty much get anything you desire .
first of all all warframe are mid-game end-game viable .
mod plays a great part as it can makes what the frame good at to the extend of being great .
it is critical to know what the frame can do with its ability and mod it toward its one or two ability to squeeze all the potential out .
then this breaks down to your frame being stealthy and using silence or silenced weapon .
there are a few frame that can go stealth ash loki ivara octavia .
in terms of speed ash can teleport to enemy loki has the fastest base movement speed ivara can remain in stealth all the time and octavia has a kit of ability that scales very well to play at any level .
for primary weapons all bows are silent all rifle can be silence by having a mod call hush '' all shotgun can not be silence but some warframe ability .
for secondary weapons all throwing weapon are silent all guns can be silence by suppress ''
if you are looking to get to mid game viable
it is a high base crit weapon so build crit and some elemental damage so that it have better scales when it crit .
for secondary you would want a automatic or semi-auto gun since bows can be slow when you are in a situation facing tons of enemies .
for melee any dagger with the mod covert lethality '' can kill anything .
or if you are into normal combat galetine is a long great sword that i will recommend .
all of the above weapon are also end game viable if you can have a full set of mod on them .

everything is a threat if there is bad news around ... if this was 2-3 months ago people would be circle jerking about futures because headlines with futures would be adding to the good news and keep the momentum alive .

fuck you pierce you crybaby clipper bench ridin ' bitch !
just to be on the safe side i 'm going to stick with texting and skype iming .
what are the top 3 features in tesla s,3 x that set it apart from any other car ?
if you had to convince someone that tesla was a revolutionary car what would top 3 features would you list ?

65 bucks for heat pressed is kinda bs given the quality .
listen if you do n't care you do n't care and 90 of people do not care and that is fine .
but if you want the best quality get it stitched .

yup definitely a bit of a trend hahaha yours also looks great !
i noticed your phillips headphones too any chance you 're a fellow z reviews https youtu.be/aipxii-qwiq viewer ?

i hate to perpetuate the elitism of opera but in most circles folks do n't really consider andrea bocelli an opera singer .
hell of a singer yes but he does n't actually work in the opera world much .
when i say order directly from wizards i mean the stores sometimes can depending on region .
obviously this may not be the case in your area .
i do n't think i have ever heard any cases of people faking the wizards logo on the plastic wrap .
i mean it is possible but likely is n't worth the effort .
i do n't think that the codes on the packs will let you tell what box something came from as they are used internally by wizards to track product that might be sold by retailers for super discounts or other violations of policy .
what region are you in if i may ask ?
maybe someone here can help you find a trustworthy website that has boxes for fair prices that wo n't cost an arm and a leg to ship to you .
it was nothing to do with it not being able to handle what they designed but everything to do with molyneaux just running his mouth about features that were never approved .
he would come up with an idea on the spot think it was cool then talk about how it would be in the game then would take it to the tech guys who said no after the fact .
i honestly do n't know what corporate can do for trade ins .
i know for my indirect we can take any trade in to use for anything we sell .
you could bring us a phone and use it to buy a charger for example .
i do n't know if corporate does anything like that hopefully somebody else can weigh in .
yeah that 's what i was going to say .
i 'd probably ask when i wanted us to be something in particular
not gon na lie i was one of those searches
a lot of countries https www.loc.gov/law/help/guestworker/index.php accept and actively look for low skill workers .
america has as much need for low skill workers as skilled workers .
this argument that only skilled workers should move here seems a little short sighted to me .
if we only allow doctors software developers and millionaires to move to america natural born citizens will be left with only low paying low skilled jobs .
all the while we will be complaining that immigrants have all the rights get all of the breaks and take all of the good jobs .
i am still thinking about bell but man lopez is so garbage on d lmfao he reminds me of bogut he will not come out at all so we get warmup shots all quarter .
i use around 400-500 kwh per month and pay 20-25 triple the usage is costing you almost 10 times as much ?
anything above 20 reps is impressive let alone for a fucking punter
it 's so that people only focus on the important things first .

fulmer is the only good player on this team .
you better hope you get something good in the draft .
well imo i thought bo3 was pretty good in multiplayer .
fun weapons decent maps great graphics way better than ww2s oddly good killstreaks and fun specialist and slowed down movement system .
the only things i did n't like about it was the lag the hit detection the scorestreaks stystem and black market .
but i ca n't wait till treyarch game comes this year .
technically my first solo travel was studying abroad in south africa at 21 y.o. but i basically landed at the airport and went straight to my university-arranged accommodation which had 7 other exchange students in it so between the exchange infrastructure and 7 best friends it never felt like i was really solo .
my first actual '' time on the road by myself was a 4 day hitchhiking trip across vancouver island when i was nearly 22 .
it was great way to dip my toes into solo travel and i confirmed that it was something i liked before committing to a long trip .
i suggest doing a short solo trip first just to be sure you do n't end up like one of the many posts in this sub that go something like i 'm day 5 out of 67 of my trip through south east asia and i hate it and i 'm lonely and solo travel is not for me what do i do ? ''
you 're also quite young so getting a bit of experience with travel in general before going for the whole enchilada is a more cautious and imo well-advised approach .
and what i would consider my first really real solo travel trip was my 5 week backpacking trip of china last year .
would not really suggest this for a first time traveler let alone first time solo traveler unless you are particularly bold .
edit i would n't really call iceland not a 'normal ' travel destination '' it 's very much on the well-worn trail for backpackers and travelers .
twinks make me cringe cause most of the time the items are traded and you can tell by their playstyle that they havent gone through the game at a low sl lvl to obtain the items and its literally every second invasion . .
i act like the point downs dont hurt but in reality half the street can hear my rage .
ex officio boxers seemed to be a decent remedy for my meat and two veg .
the balance only posts once per month so paying down that often is n't necessary to help your credit .
set a recurring reminder to pay it before your statement cuts and maybe a couple other times per month if you need to .
once you have more income for a few months give amex a call .
they might counter lower but just accept whatever they offer and work from there .
regarding autopay amex will only automatically pay once per month on schedule .
so you could set that to pay off the full balance every month and use your mid-month payment s to keep the balance lower .

i 'm pretty convinced it 's impossible for males to become professional cuddlers at least where i 'm at because the demand only goes in one direction
to me this is one of the greatest mysteries of life .
is it because of history or society as it is today ?

the morally right thing they could have done is tk notify ohaiyo and play the qualifier with a stand-in if they thought he would n't perform well .
they just used him and then threw him away .
and if the latter what functional difference is there between a male brain in a womans body causing identity issues and dysmorphia and a brain in a body causing identity issues and dysmorphia based around feeling like they are in the wrong body ?
you seem to be presuming that gender identity is tied to physiology something which has been neither proven nor disproven .
i agree with the poster above regarding lena headey .
her demeanor is far too cold and her visage is a bit too angry .
cersei is supposed to be beautiful and be able to charm her way through everything in the books at least in the beginning of the series .
in the show she relies too much on overt threatening behavior .
when you feel you can you should report them to the police it is possible that they kept their behavior and that other children are at risk because of that .
it 's not your fault and it 's fine if you do n't have the power to do so but they have to pay for what they did and never be able to do it again .
nope unlike most games the division 's pvp could give a fuck about fairness or leveling the playing field .
as a new player you are going to feel some hurt until you are geared up .
good news is with the new global event coming you should be able to gear up quickly next week .
this is completely ridiculous and overlooks that the fact they do n't do this is what makes apple good .

it may not be a system-seller but that does n't mean it does n't improve the value proposition of the switch and thus increase sales indirectly .

luckily allowing children to be the gender they really are is n't child abuse .
i have not checked the blockchain is it still a congested mess ?
i only use ltc when i 'm moving from one place to another as btc and ether are the two coins that give me headaches when moving them along blockchain cost or speed-wise .
i accidentally sent ether using the default gas set at etherdelta do n't talk and trade at the same time..lol and 5 days later i found myself sending another tx with the same amount and same nonce to another address to trigger the double-spend protection and untangle the mess .
it worked in seconds which had me going yee haw .
can somebody who has lots of experience with the following compare the following
how do all of these compare to each other ?
because from what i understand they have very similar mechanization of action .
i only have experience with phenibut and ghb once .
i also have experience with alcohol and zopiclone which are somewhat similar but stem a little further .
hopefully the sparks never disappear but if you do anything for a long time there will be times when it does go exactly how you want .
that 's true with jobs school friendships and lots of other things and it 's also true with romantic relationships .
there will be tough times because there are tough times in life .
odds are there wo n't be sparks '' there when one of you loses your job or ones of your parents die or when you get really sick and are puking everywhere. or when any of the other countless things that happen in life happen .
odds are there wo n't be sparks there when you disagree about when to have kids or how to save for retirement or how to take care of your aging parents .
so yeah the longer you stay together the more real shit you have to deal with .
it 's not going to be roses 24/7 when you have to deal with all sorts of adult things together .
that does n't mean that the sparks and excitement are gone just that sometimes you have to deal with bigger more important things .
there 's not less sparks there are just more things in between them .
they probably will if you do n't put effort into making sure they stay there .
you ca n't count on the world or life or your partner to provide excitement and passion in your relationship you have to bring it to the relationship yourself .
when it 's early in a relationship there are a lot more opportunities for the excitement of new things and new places to arise on their own .
the longer you stay together the more effort you have to put into things being exciting .
and sparks and excitement are great in a relationship but they 're not all i want .
there are some couples that do everything they can to keep the spark going and succeed in that but do n't put enough into building the other parts of their relationship .
you need to have more to your relationship than just excitement and new things .
we should be thanking you for blessing us with good fan art 3

on the matter of misunderstanding you assume the fbi investigates everything do n't you ?
a special committee must be built to avoid bias and sitting power to bleed into the findings .
your 'source ' was not fbi and not the one i 'm talking about .
you should check the gun is loaded before you pull the trigger on that ammo son .
i am not evading anything just holding back information purposefully to force you do do some damned work .
now that you engaged the last ditch effort of all trolls laughing about delusion which is damned hilarious as it is only an ad hominem attack to try and shutdown the opposition through discredit you have no legs to stand upon .
here is the one argument you can not fight you and i are internet randos whom are also only outside observers .
being uninvolved with the subject of the topic and with no other stakes at play why would anyone in such a position be required to provide backing to their points ?
second to that who would require it and enforce the requirement ?
the null answers tell us that you are shouting at windmills .
i provide sources when people hit dead ends and earnestly need help .
you are not earnest in the least only hostile .

it depends if you bought in between the 12th-15th but the s p500 dropped between the 16th-17th january .
if you bought well before that you should be seeing profit .
it could also be the brokerage taking into account etf and execution fees .
i 'm not saying these are the reasons just throwing a few potential ones out there .
having all outlets converted to 3s is a huge upfront investment for a brand with an uncertain future .
sales of proton cars is on a slight decline .
i agree with the dude that said proton should compromise that sales centres and service centres can be within a general location .
are n't most service centres located in semi-industrial areas ?
ca n't expect the dealerships that are currently located at shoplots to buy over the adjacent units just to hope people bring their cars in to service can they ?

harry not taking ebenezer with him to hit lord raith in blood rites .
i get he broke his trust but for fuck sake harry just had his hand crippled by mavra and was knowingly about to take on the leader of the entire white court .
why not just put your feeling aside for a night and use the white counils hitman to help .
he was offering and harry lets him heal his hand and accepts the pain bracelet so if your allowing that much why not take his offer .
or earlier why not take ebenezer into mavras lair and get an actual chicago local as the getaway driver .
why would he call up a wizard who could potentially make the car break down in stressful situations to be just a driver ?
so many of harrys decisions in that book felt forced .
everyone would be a blink warlock or invis hunter with 8-10 agility and games would be over so quick .
2 they 've cost millions of dollars in damage and have injured a fuck ton of people
3 your complete ignorance of the situation and your wildly ignorant views on politics makes your opinions irrelevant .
the democratic party is far more left than it was under the clinton administration which is n't necessarily a bad thing when looking at it but if you 're dead serious that a centrist party just ran a socialist and a woman who wanted to raise the minimum wage to 15 nationwide you are completely sheltered in and by your own opinions .
also the gop tried fucking hard to keep trump from getting elected and if you see all of the platform as being racist then you are a stereotypical r/politics browser and need to open your mind up to what people with opposing viewpoints actually believe .
as a matter of fact this whole all republicans are racist '' bullshit helped sink hillary by calling all trump supporters deplorables '' .
i usually sit around high gold/low plat and my team counters dry pushes with a high damage output .

when we do this it usually forces the other team to ult just to break through .

i dont agree with the op on all points but
kids will cry to their parents to get one and many will buy it to please their kids no matter the cost .
or it genuinely was the worst episode of the entire series by a mile .
its characters were uninteresting and detestable axel pulling a knife on a little girl for example yet they go on to try to make him look bad ass ... .
they kill people that kali tells them to kill and seem to unquestionably relish in it .
they rob and hurt innocent people in the process .
none of them have any positive or redeemable qualities at all it 's just a gang of sociopaths obsessed with their image .
first thing they do to el i mean after axel threatened her with a knife that is !
is dress her up as a punk because they are obsessed with image .
the plot is a cliche revenge plot that makes little sense .
they have track down and locate a bunch of people even though kali has known all along exactly where they work ?
i wrote more extensively about this in a comment just last night https www.reddit.com/r/strangerthings/comments/7r5mds/just_finished_season_2_as_a_new_fan_and_holy_sht/dsulwxe
i do n't understand why you and others to be fair seem to have little passive aggressive jibes at people who do n't agree with you about the episode .
pretty much everyone who disliked the episode loves the series they just felt that was an experiment that fell flat on its face .
it was a good idea to give el more of a story because she needed it but they did it poorly .
that 's how i feel about it and i expect people disagree .
i wo n't question their motives for doing so !
they put on the robe and mask and kidnapped people in this costume
agreed problem is that the sectors in which he has experience wo n't enable him to afford to live in amsterdam .

that 's an issue for both the left and the right .
the right ignores police unions specifically when they go union busting and i have listened to far too much bullshit from the left about how the police unions are just doing their job .
literally just had the article about body cameras and the police union opposing footage release and got to hear all about how it 's just a poor union doing what it 's supposed to be doing .
unions have a place in the world today but allowing them as much political leverage as they have gained is just as detrimental to allowing companies to have it .
neither side recognizing the balance needed is the reason this has spiraled out of control .
i would say you were onto something but i 've seen that ad pop up all over the place .
i doubt they would intentionally mislead people on the order page .
why do people assume the best after being lied to so many times ?
why would they match with you if they do n't like your looks ?
if its not fun then maybe you need to be playing with different band members .
yes you have groups like 'the police ' who all hated each other but still made sick tunes but part of our chemistry is that were all best mates and rehearsal and work are just hang outs with a laptop .
we put in a ton of sweat blood and beers into the band but it does n't feel like work because we all enjoy spending time with one another .
a big bag of cans every now and again also helps .
perhaps try shake something up in your routine first before quitting .
i started with ssri from the gp and talking with a psychologist .
it soon became apparent i needed more than that and my gp referred me to a psychiatrist who now oversees my medication .
my psychiatrist is great because we talk too and in australia she can refer me to dbt programs and oversee me as an inpatient etc .
my psychiatrist and psychologist work for the same service so they communicate a lot .
so you get the best of both worlds but do n't always feel like you 're repeating yourself at all your appointments etc

my point was that the aether was drawn trying to bind him with the spell not by becoming phoenix he became phoenix after the spell failed .
the spell drew aether from hydaelyn yeah a necessary evil but that aether was supposed to return to the land after they both died .

as the title states i was diagnosed with west nile virus in the beginning of 2014 .
i was 19 at the time 5'11 '' 260 lbs .
after countless trips to the emergency room/doctors visits i did some digging on the internet to find answers that i was not given during these visits .
after about 3-4 trips to my primary care physician with the same symptoms he began to take me less serious .
during the last visit i asked him if he would take my word for something and that i had been doing some extensive research on my symptoms big no-no in the medical world and luckily he heard me out .
later that day i was at my local urgent care getting blood work done to be tested for lyme 's disease and west nile virus .
as suspected the blood work came back positive and showed my body did indeed carry the antibodies for west nile .
my symptoms at the time were as followed chronic migraine dizziness fatigue both mental and physical chest pain blurred vision loss of appetite vomiting chills fever diarrhea heart palpitations numbness/tingling of extremities lost 40 lbs very quick extreme anxiety breathing problems history of asthma and a newly developed acid reflux problem .
soon after being diagnosed with this i developed symptoms that seemed more like a gastrointestinal problems and began seeing a specialist .
in the same year i was diagnosed with gerd hiatal hernia w/o obstruction/gangrene and gallstones led to gallbladder removal .
i was prescribed omeprazole maalox and sent on my way .
i have since recovered from most of those symptoms .
i still battle with my acid reflux occasionally experience breathing issue feels like i ca n't get a full breath fatigue chest pain seems to be more of a costochondritis pain in the cartilage .
when i experience these symptoms they seem to come all at once and it is very overwhelming .
now that it has been about 4 years i am wondering if these symptoms are still related to the west nile virus or if it is a mixture of other health issues i may have .
i am currently taking general vitamins multi super b-complex vitamin d3 omeprazole when needed amoxixillin currently have strep throat and an albuterol inhaler rescue .
i have a follow up with my gastro in about a month and i will be asking him alot of the same things but any input that anybody may have in the mean time would be greatly appreciated .
it is truly taking a toll on me to not be a normal functioning young adult .
tl dr i was diagnosed with west nile virus at 19 i am now 23 and still experiencing some of the same symptoms .
could it be related and if so will i ever get over it ?
i 've been a sca for a while and have a very simple skincare routine .

he definitely gets his respect but i feel like a lot of people sleep on him because he always played second fiddle to arguable the greatest player of all time .
pippen to me is one of the greatest all-around players in the history of the nba probably not in my top 10 all-time but definitely in my top 20 .
for some idea there are only 6 players in nba history https www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi ? request=1 match=combined type=totals per_minute_base=36 per_poss_base=100 season_start=1 season_end=-1 lg_id=nba age_min=0 age_max=99 is_playoffs=n height_min=0 height_max=99 birth_country_is=y as_comp=gt as_val=0 pos_is_g=y pos_is_gf=y pos_is_f=y pos_is_fg=y pos_is_fc=y pos_is_c=y pos_is_cf=y c1stat=pts c1comp=gt c1val=18000 c2stat=trb c2comp=gt c2val=6000 c3stat=ast c3comp=gt c3val=6000 order_by=ws with 18000 pts 6000 ast and 6000 reb lebron james oscar robertson kobe bryant clyde drexler john havlickek and scottie pippen .

this is n't even taking into account how good of a defender that pippen was as he has the 5th most all-defensive team selections https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nba_all-defensive_team most_selections in nba history with 10 behind duncan with 15 garnett with 12 kobe with 12 and kareem with 11 .
also 8 of those selections were first team tying him with duncan and jones while garnett bryant payton and jordan had 9 .
of course his inability to lead the bulls past the 2nd round without jordan might hurt his legacy but i still think it should n't take away from the player he was .
going back to his old sound kinda with more bangers kinda like sidewalks

so i have a 144hz monitor using a dvi-d cable and and a elgato hd60 s capture card using an hdmi cable running with 60fps
i tried using the method where i extend my desktop to my capture card and do an obs preview window on that and record but when playing overwatch the fps monitor in game says 144 which is good but it doesnt feel like 144 .
this post explains my problem my setup is strong enough when i move the obs preview to my 144hz monitor when i play it feels like what its supposed to be .
i 've been getting into playing competitive leagues on mtgo a bit more seriously over the past couple months and noticed the coverage accounts playing in competitive leagues a couple times .
i 'm not sure if they actually regulate who can create accounts with that handle or if random players can too but if these were official accounts it seems kind of odd playing against a coverage account in a league .
do n't those accounts have access to a full playset of all cards ever printed and basically have nothing at stake when playing whereas normal players are coughing up tix/playpoints ?

is it really that more beneficial to run the vega 64 bios over where i 'm sitting currently ?
my 56 is under a full custom water loop as i do game on this rig when i have time but figured i 'd join the mining craze to see if i could net some extra income down the road .

where would you guys recommend me getting my t levels checked and how do i go about doing this .

we 'd love to hear from you to understand the demands of your college courses and get your reaction to a revolutionary new offering designed specifically to accelerate your learning .
i 'm a brand new dm with a party of brand new level 1 players 5e .
we 've done session 0 and session 1 of a home brew campaign .
in session 0 i led them through what i thought would be a throwaway bit of gameplay to show them the mechanics of skill checks and the like .
it was basically that they were trying to cross a rickety rope bridge across a chasm which lead them to a giant keep built into the side of a mountain .
i ended it right as the rogue picked a lock on the guard house and creaked the door open .
when i did they all screamed what 's behind the door ? ! ''
i started them off on the actual narrative but sort of on a whim as an additional story hook i said they all had just woken up that morning after all having the same intense dream .
the dream i described was the session 0 practice round .
so now that dream is part of the narrative and i 'm looking for ideas for a nice payoff on bringing it back later in the story .
i 'm assuming the keep will end up being the home of a mini-boss or the bbeg but am open to other ideas .
i 'm mostly trying to come up with a reason for why that encounter gave them all a joint premonition ?
the party consists of 3 tieflings 2 half elves a halfling and 1 human .
the devs continuously drop the ball on things we care about and the patches lately are n't what we 're hoping for .
but is that a reason to attack a community rep when they show up to ask us what bugs we 're seeing ?
these guys whether you like how often they 're here or not do not code this game .
they do not make decisions for the dev team they do not allocate funds and manpower on behalf of epic .
a lot of the replies to their comments and the toxic nature of some of the posts here are gross .
but do you honestly think calling people idiots cursing in all caps and attacking both community reps and other players is going to solve anything ?
and i ca n't imagine what a new person to this game would think if they stumbled on this sub .
this is without a doubt the most vile gaming community i have been a part of .
the first rule of this sub is to be civil .
you 're so angry you ca n't hold it in anymore ?
there 's a refund section on epic 's website .
use it and save yourself and other players your temper tantrums .
disclosures first i am not a locksmith obviously and this is my first post to the sub .
i have a local locksmith coming out in about a week and have a few questions prior to the visit .
i am interested to know if these questions should be discussed prior to locksmith coming out or at the time of the visit .
i would like to have an anti bump driver pin put in the locks that will be rekeyed if they do not already have them .
is this something that needs to planned in advance ?
similar to above should i request this sort of thing in advance ?
would 1 and 2 likely increase the cost of rekeying dramatically ?
bonus question i have been getting into locks as a hobby would it be appropriate to ask if the locksmith has any throwaway/old/otherwise unsellable cores that i could purchase or would it be more appropriate/more well received to discuses during the visit and stop by the shop at some point to avoid an inconvenience ?
im a adult female i have family that is very distance from each other .
i ca n't come and talk to no one about my feelings because i will be judge or it will be used against me .
when i need help or advice on choices in life i try to ask my parent but they never seem to have the answer they never support or give me advice its always a brush or push off of idk '' what do you think '' they will only support me if im already there .
not lifting me up or helping me to get there .
i feel so alone and lost my life seem as if everything is falling apart .
i wish i had my life figured out so long ago .
what can i do to believe in myself and motivate myself to do things ?
have you ever just been browsing the internet and wondered what a particular celebrity is doing right now ?
have you ever been looking at pictures of them on reddit and thought to yourself hmm i wonder how she is in bed ?
ever considered if they like it rough or romantic public or private an all night fuck fest or just a quickie on set ?
well i would like to invite you to roleplay finding out what happens when sexy celebs get horny .
maybe they are on tinder looking for a hook up and you match with them .
perhaps you are an extra on set who catches their eye and before you know it you have them bent over in their trailer .
you might even be a fellow celebrity and the two of you are secretly hooking up and shagging every spare moment !
so pick a celebrity or two from the list below and have a think what you 'd like to do with me playing them .
send the sexiest picture of them along with your message too ...
cara delevingne i bet she 's a wildcat in bed
looking forward to the orange envelopes and looking forward to celebrity sex even more ...
i have a few questions about access concentration the disappearance of the breath sensations at the nose and the jhanas .
1 for the last week or so i 'm finding that it only takes a few breaths at most 5 after sitting before the breathing sensations disappear almost completely .
its clearly not subtle dullness because i am literally just starting my sit and my awareness of the breathing sensations throughout the entirety of my body are quite vivid that awareness is something i 've cultivated for years as part of my martial arts training but i digress so i know i am still breathing .
there is a feeling of furrowing '' or condensing '' in my head right between the eyebrows .
outside observers have told me i am not furrowing my brow nor are my eyes crossing or narrowing when i have my eyelids half open .
i assume this is access concentration but is it ?
2 with some intention i can make the intensity/imploding feeling spread throughout my body usually in a pulsing manner alongside my breath so it feels less concentrated .
i guess the visual analogy would be having an intense spotlight then diffusing it through a screen so it becomes more ambient .
the same amount of power '' is getting through its just being spread out .
but there is always a spot of slightly greater intensity and as the volume '' in my body increases with each breath it seems to originate from this spot .
3 at the same time the breath becomes faint and that intense spot develops if i so much as smile the intense spot explodes into a full body orgasm sensation .
i find if i hold a completely neutral expression i can stay in what i assume is access concentration for a bit but if i do smile or notice any pleasurable sensations the onset/intensity is even greater .
i also notice the pleasurable sensations building in peripheral awareness until i can not ignore it anymore .
should i stay in access concentration longer or just fall straight into this state ?
4 i have the perception that i can move '' the intense spot through my body and at different locations i feel different emotions sensations or other weirdness .
back of my head towards the occiput sudden feeling of vertigo or moving backward at very fast speed .
i lose sense of my body and sometimes fall backward which ends the state .
the usual winking diffuse white static '' i see against the black backdrop of my eyelids become bright sharp jagged arc lightning '' phenomena .
very intense want to throw back my head and laugh and lift my arms above my head .
front of chest either intense beaming pride or intense fuzzy thats adorable aww '' feeling i do n't know how else to describe it .
want to hug things actually makes me cry a little .
diaphragm the body from head to tips of fingers to feet feels ballooned like i am yawning and not stopping even though i am not yawning .
no clear emotional sensations but urge to stand up and run .
front of belly almost start of pubic area post orgasm afterglow belly distends like its full .
if i let the spot '' down into the perineum area and further down almost visualizing it going through the floor if sitting or through my legs into the soles of my feet if standing all emotional feelings disappear and i feel very still .
hearing gets turned down dramatically but i find i can not sustain this for too long because the down '' sensation makes me physically hunch over and in attempting to not fall over the state whatever it is breaks .
i do not notice any brightness '' or white light '' but i can not stay in this state for much longer than maybe 10 seconds before i hunch over and fall out of it .
why do i suddenly feel like my body is falling down ?
i am actually concerned about experimenting with this any further because i am noticing areas of very intense unpleasant sensations usually along my back and i would prefer not to accidentally stumble upon anything .
thanks for any information anyone can give i know this all sounds quite odd !
suppose you 're top gm but do n't play the first few weeks of a season .
after placements you 'll be master 1k with a personal rank adjustment of say 20 corresponding to gm mmr .
the game still insists on matching you with low master players .
the queue is long because it is hard to find an even mmr match between low master players when it is trying to include a gm .
so i 've made a smurf account that i 'm playing adc only on and it got placed gold 3 .
my main is masters and adc is only my secondary role but holy fuck how do you win as adc at low elo ?
there 's so much reliance on your support to actually zone at the right time and not stand behind you maxing e for some reason on janna .
it 's so hard to solo win lane even at this elo as adc .
in part 17 laura asks where are we going ? ''
observation 1 this would normally be a comforting answer .
but in laura 's case it 's the opposite .
observation 2 cooper says we 're going home '' instead of you 're going home . ''
could just be a way of saying i 'm taking you home '' but it could also mean we have the same home and we 're going there . ''
but whether it 's laura 's home or laura cooper 's home where is it ?
i recently got the dispatch http www.dispatchapp.net mail client for ios .
i got it mostly because it will share the link back to a message using the message '' protocol which is what apple mail uses .
so the theory is that i can put links in my refile and then open them on my mac .
note the 's which i presume are some kind of url encoding .
if i click on the grab-mac-link it works fine .
if i click on the dispatch link i get a mail was unable to open the url '' error .
if i do browse-url on the dispatch link i get a url that looks like http message ... '' and if i delete the http part the link opens correctly .
this tells me that the links are not damaged they are just being parsed wrong somehow .
how do i make it so i can click on the dispatch links please ?
edit i 've just looked more carefully at the error message i 'm getting from mail the url it 's choking on has two 3 strings at the beginning and end .
so the act of clicking the link is adding an additional encoded set of angle brackets which i suppose is fine when they do n't exist in the grab-mac-link example above .
while i 'm very new to the world of riding motorcycles i 've been following reddit and the forums for a while an armchair biking enthusiast if you will .
i 'm trying to decide on my first bike something i can use as a daily driver and also as something for longer trips out to the desert or mountains .
i live in los angeles which means most of my days will be sunny and dry and i 'll need something that can keep up on freeways .
the practical part of me says get something made in the last 10 years but if i was adhering to that side of me i would n't be getting a motorcycle to begin with .
two of the models i 've found local to me that i 'm into are a honda cb550 and a bmw 75/6 .
i know some would say i 'm comparing apples and oranges here but what do you ya 'll think i should go with ?
on one hand the cb550 may be more manageable as a first bike and more forgiving with drops and damage but i 've heard great things about the bmw as well .
edit both bikes i 'm looking into are under 3000 running restored etc .

a lot of players every day at the start of the season
a lot of newbies go into ranked for the first time can not cs do not know how to position themselves do n't know what to do and when
every game is a clown fiesta darius mid 2 afks,1-time shaco in the jungle 1-time riven in the toplane
i am sorry if i feel salty but it 's not only my complaints .
my wife felt the same our friends who won more than 50 of their qualification matches feel the same .
i do n't know how to fix it so the next season i will definitely not play ranked until the missions are over .
so i have some more nord related questions tonight before i retire and rest up .
some might be odd as to be expected from more thankfully nothing about nord heights though i still find myself curious about a nord that was considered short '' such as a male that was 5'7 '' or 5'8 '' breton or imperial average height but i digress .
hopefully i can some additional insight in terms of the nords .
so i have to ask first of all what exactly can be say is the general consensus of nordic armor design ?
it seemingly fluctuates with the games and the ages .
ancient nordic http images.uesp.net//b/b2/sr-item-ancient_nord_armor_male.jpg appears to be a cross to this viewer 's eyes between celtic germanic norse and roman armor .
then we have armor from the second era https i.ytimg.com/vi/l44ndfwwtz0/maxresdefault.jpg with have a viking/norse-esque aesthetic with obvious fantasy elements that uses both plate scale and fur/hide in its style the ebonheart pact 's armor style https eso.mmo-fashion.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/08/eso-imperial-city-ep-heavy-male1.jpg which resembles something that fits a member of the daggerfall covenant or a breton with a flair of bretonnia from warhammer fantasy fouth era nordic steel https images.uesp.net//9/90/sr-item-steel_armor_male.jpg steel plate https images.uesp.net//e/e4/sr-item-steel_plate_armor_male.jpg and nordic carved https images.uesp.net//d/df/db-item-nordic_carved_armor_male.jpg .
what can we say about the influences or general designs of nordic armor through the eras or in general ?
does the knightly '' aesthetic seemingly belong to the nords going by some of the examples or has a link with the bretons or is this something a bit unique to them based on the designs of steel plate and the pact armor for example ?
also i read that modern nords on tamriel have not only scandinavian/norse influence but also germanic influences in their culture/society/lifestyle ?
i know the ancient nords have aspects of hindu egyptian as well as ancient norse culture and mythology in their lifestyle and mythos but are there germanic/western european influences in modern nordic society or is it strictly northern european ?
finally unless more questions come to mind soon what exactly is nordic technology like ?
i know they have a sewer system in solitude and going by legends trebuchets much to my surprise but what is nordic technology like compared to the bretons imperials dunmer altmer redguards etc ?
i know no one can compare to the dwemer in this regard but how do the nords fair seeing as they are in one of the few provinces with dwemer ruins ?
do you think healy will be back in s6 ?
i 'm assuming so since michael harney is still a cast member .
i know most people hate him with good reason but i want to see him come back with a new outlook thanks to finally getting his shit dealt with and maybe become an advocate for prisoner rights/the bunker ladies .
i want him to get a redemption arc like pennsatucky did .
and i 'm not gon na lie i wan na see him and red get together .
i decided to watch the fourth season of enterprise since i 've never seen it and in the 15th episode there is a fat seth macfarlane who knew ?
in the dundies '' there is a discussion about the ceremony that will take place that evening at chili 's and stanley says something to michael about making sure to order enough appeteasers '' because they did n't have enough last year .
did chili 's try to use wordplay in their marketing and stanley 's dialogue is reflecting that ... or did he just pronounce the word in a weird way ?
also unrelated but i know one of the extras at chili 's
this is the best tl dr i could make original http www.blog.bitcointobanks.com/2018/01/19/institutional-investors-will-bet-big-on-cryptocurrencies-in-2018 reduced by 77 .
unlike the stock market which is seeing its eight-year bull run thanks in part to institutional investors crypto-markets are dominated by individual investors .
the burgeoning opportunities for institutional investment as blockchain use-cases become more prevalent expect increased institutional investment in cryptocurrency markets .
ultimately individual interest spurs institutional interest and that will have a significant impact on the value of digital currencies .
bitcoin futures contracts on chicago based exchanges run by cme group and cboe group represent burgeoning opportunities for institutional investment .
in short bitcoin hedge funds are counting their profits in thousands of percent and institutional investors can 039 t stay away forever .
the real growth driver will be institutional investments which will be spurred on by the individual investors who want to participate in crypto markets through institutional platforms and by the market forces that make the possibility of considerable profits too essential to pass up .

anyone know if the 2nd leg of the mania tour in the us will have a meet greet with any vip bundles ?
i 've been a long time player since the split with over 3k hours .
i 've mostly played h1z1 because i like the battle royale type gameplay but the game since the combat update has n't been the same and i no longer seem to enjoy it .
the game with all the new additions just does n't feel like the h1z1 i came to fall in love with and was wondering about a few things ...
is it possible to turn js into a battle royale game like we had early on before the split ?
why do the 2 games look so much different ?
would you guys ever consider re adding a battle royale variant back to the game ?

my five year old loves pokemon and loves to draw .
he has been drawing from his cards and a poster all day .
here 's his voltorb pikipek growlithe i think that 's who he said it was supposed to be two pikachus and two from yo kia watch .
not pictured are gastly koffing and i 'm not sure who else he has drawn .
ok you know you want to show off that stunt stick of yours .
or better yet you want to show off all five of your skate bananas .
line 'em up on the living room carpet or prop them against the closet door in your dorm and take the blurriest goddamn cell phone picture you can then post it here where nobody cares .
or maybe somebody does care and you can talk about which banana is best .
honestly though if you have a rad quiver and you want to show it off or maybe you just bought your first full set-up or you 're stoked on a new pair of goggles or whatever post 'em here .
i need to do more research myself but from first glance it looks like it might be promising .

so i 've been playing skyrim for maybe a couple of hundred hours never even completed the main quest i 've reached level 60-65 .
mostly played as ... you guessed it stealth archer .
now i am very intrigued by this ordinator perk overhaul you 've got right here and yesterday i reinstalled skyrim special edition added this and a few other mods apocalypse – magic of skyrim imperious – races of skyrim aurora standing stones of skyrim alternate start mod i saw in a youtube video and found on nexus .
last time i played it was on either expert or master and found it relatively easy .
since i am not using any combat mods first i thought i should go for requiem but it will wait for now i thought this time i should go for legendary .
does this mod add too much power that it needs a difficulty mod '' to balance it or do you think the vanilla legendary would be enough for me to not trivially faceroll content ?
oh another question does this mod work with the legendary skill reset ?
aka do they work as they do in the unmodded game since i 've read some mods read requiem prevent them
edit i am talking about ordinator perk overhaul i was n't very clear on that in the original post .
edit 2 after a google search or two i realized enai made most of the mods i decided on using .
i 've been mining with minergate and have recently noticed how inefficient it is .
i would still consider myself a new miner but have tried out other pools such as bytcoinpool.uk using claymore miner but it seems to have a issue with my wallet address and contacting the server .
i 've gone through almost all of youtube and google trying to figure out a step by step guide but could n't find anything .
is there an easy way to transition from minergate to claymore or xmr stak amd ?
update i was able to correctly configure my claymore miner for bytecoin.uk and saw an increase in hashing power .
when i hit another miner to configure bytecoin.uk 's site is down .
update i have a miner of 3 rx 580 and one vega .
i tried switching that over to claymore but it gives me several error codes gpuminer k1a failed 4 and gpuminer dk2an0 failed 4 and then tries to restart .
i shall write down my desires then feel it !

i 'm looking for a hacker that can do a money transfer and can provide proof before receiving payment anyone got any recommendations ?
on 15 on january i tried purchasing gh/s on hashflare but my transaction still havent been confirmed and my purchase on hashflare is marked as invalid so i have lost any hope the purchase will come through so i wondering whats the maximum time my transaction can be stuck in a mempool as unconfirmed transaction ?
i know blockchain and hashflare arent responsible for confirming transactions but i am just asking how much time it takes for unconfirmed transactions to become rejected transactions ?
i just moved into a condo where there was no air conditioning .
i installed a window air conditioner it was n't easy as i had to get a handyman to come do it as my window slides from side to side rather than up to down as a result my window air conditioner is now permanent installed and the handyman just put some cardboard above the ac .
my condo is super loud as a result because all of the outside noise automatically just comes in since i have just cardboard as my cover.. is there any sort of foam or something i could buy and put over the cardboard to make the noise go away ?
hey i 've been considering buying a signed poster from blade runner for awhile now .
i am weary on just buying one as the price varies from 90-1900 .
i was wondering if anyone has bought signed memorabilia and could give me some tips on what to look for .
since the things that guardians throw are generally bad for a warbeast 's health this is generally hilarious .
i attribute the decimation of the enlightenment values to the post-modernist influence found in academic pedagogy excluding stem although it 's slowly creeping in there .
furthermore this is slowly extending to high-schools and primary schools .
to me this is very frightening since these are formative years where teaching if ideological can induce precepts or intellectual axioms that can take a lifetime to change .
some information on the actual power dynamics in schooling namely between postmodern and more traditional teachers ?
possible solutions or recommendations as to how we could attempt to redress this ?
i downloaded the update today and started noticing strange differences .
the ones that stuck out were the massive in your face sparks that would happen every now and again in combat .
and the jarring screen flash when i parried an enemies light attacks .
i looked around at the subreddit and it seems people are split 50/50 on this topic .
would it be possible to have an option to toggle these effects off implemented ?

i have an a6500 as one of my backup cameras and i am purchasing a dual a7riii setup for my weddings .
i love the a6500 but i would like to get a battery grip for it .
and others like it and i do not want to use cables and other stuff to make my grip work and i would prefer sony quality .
does anyone know if they have any plans on releasing one for these cameras ... ?
is it likely that we wo n't see a fourth installment until the ps5/xboxtwo or whatever comes out ?
would they want to release a game before that or does it make more sense that they would have it be a next generation game ?
this would give us a 2020 release date or there abouts

it seems after an update a self restart takes place but then the system ca n't get past the login screen so i have to login wait for the update to finish and often a second reboot before i can use my pc .
why do you let me schedule updates at 2am so they do n't interfer if i have to complete the update .
is n't win 10 microsoft smart enough to know it 's a self reboot for updates ?
ca n't it bypass the login screen if it 's making itself restart ?

usually you go to a psychic 's website such as rosemary price the famous psychic clairvoyant and medium at http www.webclairvoyant.com .
then you look through the various email readings available and arrange it there .
you may well have a site where there is no choice but with rosemary you can choose from different things to suit different needs .
you ought to get some sort of receipt from paypal to confirm it and with her you also get a receipt from her to put your mind at rest .
then you wait a few days for your reading .
as it says on her site it takes up to 5 working days and she is very popular and busy .
beware of those who say they will write back straight away that either means they are not at all busy wit no clients or they are sending you some vague thing they send to everyone .
by way of an introduction to numbers 16 and the two chapters to follow numbers 16 17 and 18 should actually be treated as one unit i want to introduce the primary themes we should keep in mind as we work our way through this chapter and the two to follow .
the first thing you need to know is that this chapter is all about the uncompromising position the priesthood was to hold in israel 's national life .
the contents of this chapter will serve to remind us of the superior status the tribe of levi possessed as well as the supreme holiness the priesthood a sub-group within levi held .
all of this will be demonstrated in the story of a group of rebels who decided to go against the established god-ordained holiness hierarchy .
understand that when hashem through moses first gave his torah to the people of israel it was nothing but abstract concepts to them .
they had received a bunch of do 's and don'ts rituals and festival observances and a list of consequences and punishments for disobeying but they had never learned how to practically apply them to their daily lives .
it was all just a bunch of theories to them .
what made things even more difficult is that the people were still living in the desert and a good portion of the instructions the lord had given them would not even be possible to observe until israel entered the promised land .
to this ancient middle eastern society that had just left egypt a lot of the instructions they received about how to live a godly life seemed downright strange and impractical to them .
their viewpoint was probably quite identical to how the gentile church views the torah today .
the notion they harbor is that it 's just an old book containing a bunch of antiquated instructions that have no relevance for the modern believer who is under the new covenant .
i 'll never forget the time i got my first parking ticket .
i was in a rush to pick something up at the supermarket and i found a nice little spot behind the store where i could park my vehicle .
the only problem was that area was a prohibited parking zone .
i said to myself ‘heck i 'll only be here for 10 minutes and then i 'll be gone .
after my little sojourn to the supermarket i returned to my car to find that universally dreaded white rectangular slip of paper dangling from my windshield .
the laws governing where i could and could not park were not some theory but very real .
and i would now have to pay real consequences for violating these laws .
in fact a fresh realization came over me that everything i had studied in the traffic guide book to prepare to get my driver 's license was not just for my intellectual entertainment .
those rules were very very real and that i had best obey all of the them or pay the consequences whether it be suffering a comparatively light punishment for a misdemeanor such as speeding or paying a heavy price for something much more serious such as drunk driving which puts other lives in danger .
here 's what we have to know about god 's torah or instructions .
the only way to grow and strengthen our faith is to put god 's commands into practice in real life .
if israel had never left the foot of mount sinai and decided to just blissfully gather manna every day and do nothing but tend to their animals in peace and quiet most of the torah would have remained mere head knowledge to them .
the only way israel was going to grow was to experience life raw and uncensored with all of its temptations and difficulties .
that is why god was going to having them battle to take the promised land .
it is only by applying god 's principles and commands in challenging situations that his torah becomes very practical and real to us .
you ca n't just sit in a classroom all day .
you 've got to step out into the battlefield of life and take some risks .
and yes you will stumble and fall and you will endure hardship but you will also grow tremendously because of your struggles .
there is no better way to solidify your faith than to apply god 's torah in the arena of life .
we 're going to be studying about a series of rebellions by the people of israel against moses and aaron .
the people were n't really rebelling against moses and aaron .
they thought they were rebelling against mere men but they were really rebelling against god .
that mistaken perception was going to cost them their lives .
in fact i do n't think it would be an exaggeration to say that moses was the old testament equivalent of yeshua the messiah .
he held a special status in his day that no other men held .
in this sense numbers chapter 16 is very informative in that it teaches us the proper response to god 's appointed mediators .
for example there are many liberal scholars both jews and gentiles who view yeshua as a great religious leader or teacher but deny the special role he held as god ‘s chosen mediator and savior .
well those men who rebelled against moses made the same mistake .
they may have had respect for moses as a human leader but they failed to grasp his divinely superior status as god 's chosen mediator .
the failure to understand this superior position that moses held was going to cost them their lives .

i take the spiro in the morning along with an estradiol and four sprays synarel in the evening i take another estradiol and my other four sprays of synarel .
me being an idiot over the past couple days i 've forgotten to do at least one of those two steps twice .
i remember that i need to take them around the time i 'm about to take my second dose or in case of the ones in the evening when i take my dose in the morning .
i have highschool so i get up really early and it 's usually easy for me to remember to take my pills only had a few close calls but i also work till 10 11 at night so when i get home it 's sometimes hard for me to remember to take my pills even if they are sitting right next to my bed in plain sight any tips on how to remember to take them ?
im afraid that i 'll end up missing a day and mess everything up or something .

it 's definitely not an americanization it was fairly common until about 15 years ago but the term has fallen out of favour and i ca n't remember the last time i heard it in conversation .
that said you 'll find brits almost never actually talk about the channel tunnel at all although i do n't live anywhere near it and presume conversation about it is more common in folkestone .
presumably because from 1985-2005 the channel tunnel was a big current project then a recent event then a big part of the whole princess diana death events in 1997 ... . since then though it 's just a tunnel that goes to france unless you 're about to use it it 's not a big deal .
even then we tend not to mention the tunnel itself much .
it 's still just a tunnel at the end of the day .

its horrible that your mom would lack empathy enough that you having a mental breakdown would be something she 'd punish you for and make all about herself .
one of the unfortunate things about being college-aged is that you can be friends with people who have never had to face real tragedy pain or loss in their lives and as a result can end up acting like immature shitheads to anyone who is actually in pain because they do n't have any clue how to deal with it yet .
i 'm sorry that you had to bear the brunt of that with supposed friends ' cruel comments and jokes at your expense .
i hope that someday they 're able to be better people who do n't act so callous towards the pain of others but right now you deserve so much better from your friends .
you 're also not the only one who has found themselves failing classes when mental health issues come to overwhelm their ability to focus and do the things that need to get done there 's no shame in sometimes stumbling and many schools will be understanding of the fact that young adults will make mistakes and struggle sometimes in their academic career .

just another liberal party front to funnel votes back to them .
in my state my therapist is a mandatory reporter who is legally bound to report suspected child abuse to the authorities .
my guess is that the law is similar where you are and your therapist did n't understand that this applies to her specifically not to people generally .
i 've always had trouble describing the genre to people who ask .
i mean colony management game sometimes with rogue-like elements is usually what i answer .
but something like prison architect or factorio although that 's more like conveyor belt supply chain
management game seems more like archetypal colony management to me .
rimworld is probably best described as a colony management game with rogue-like elements and a focus on character traits/interaction/stats health .
i also do n't really like referring to it as a 'base builder ' because that implies it 's more like a scaled down city builder .
somewhat unrelated but i recently picked up oxygen not included .
i 'd go so far as to call it somewhat of a rimworld-lite at times .
they 're not actually that related but it does remind me of it .
i think if the oni characters had personalities like in rw it would be a pretty accurate comparison as it stands oni is more of a typical base building survival game .
i do recommend checking it out if you like these style of games
being swole certainly is leagues better than being fat but humans are best optimised for being lean .

plex is amazing and even if you do n't use all the features its a great way to support the devs .
who knows they could publish a feature in the future you would want and would need plex pass to use it .
when my friends come over they love seeing all my media displayed so nice and that crisp environment .
i 'm particularly interested in the fact that softmake uses ms file extensions .
this is a neat feature that can be very useful for academic environments but also scares me away from trying .
so proud he is and always will be a seminole

i think feeling violated is jumping the gun but everyone is entitled to feel how they feel .
i dispute 6 of 7 but in a more nuanced manner far less black white than your approach .
for example i reject the idea that the natural leader must be a male i say that the natural leader must be charismatic if in fact a central leader actually exists .
i disagree with your supposition that there is n't unity within antifa i think that there is in fact unity .
the problem with the current unity definition is that it does n't recognize the effect of social media and the ability of loosely associated groups to communicate .
iow this definition is changing due to technological advances .
assuming that social darwinism relies on skin colour is at best described as simplistic and oversimplified .
that 's because it 's anti-liberal anti-capitalist anti-communist anti-libertarian on any other political condition fascism proposes to oppose .
antifa opposes conservatism libertarianism and liberalism depending on which spokesperson you choose to ask .

i have somewhere an unused ticket from pink floyd the wall live in berlin .
a friend of mine and his girlfriend were going to the concert ... but a few hours before he found her blowing a bus driver ... so he just packed up his stuff inc the tickets and came home .
fact because they view it as racist most people do n't want to be called colored .
that 's why it 's racist because that 's how the majority feels .
so again how you feel about it is irrelevant .
take yourself out of the equation jesus christ get over yourself lmao .
it 's racist and not okay to call people colored because people of color do n't like being called colored because it 's racist .
i do n't understand how you are n't following lmao .
just because you think it 's okay does not make it okay .
thinking your small insignificant opinion makes it okay to call the majority who do n't like it colored speaks volumes about you .
fact calling people racist terms knowing it 's a racist term and knowing most people consider bit a racist term kind of makes you racist
you sound exactly like those white people that go i 'm not racist but ... ''
consumers like you me and everyone else are the ones that determine the market .
that is that is what i was hoping to hear .

i think it 's like because so many amazing scenes happed in the dark knight.the audience will seem to forget about the smaller details and focus on the ones they like more.i do n't know i 'm not the best at this kind of stuff .
this build started with an i5 6600k built back in october of 2016 and i had about 300 spare around black friday so i figured an i7 would be the best upgrade for me because i only play in 1080p and a 1060 is plenty for me .
also yes i have both youtube and twitch channels that the i7 has vastly helped me improve the quality of .
edit i was also able to pick up the i7 7700k for 280 on newegg on black friday and the fact i already had a 240mm aio made it seem like the perfect upgrade

i knew how to ice skate but getting more fundamentally sound was the key .
i put in a lot of practice and even just skating in my street with roller skater helped a lot .
everything else kinda just fell into place but i was on the ice as much as i could .

i spent summers skating with junior and echl teams .
playing with guys like that definitely speed up my progression .

it was hard work but i enjoyed every minute of it .

today 's two-sol plan will wrap up activities at vera rubin ridge location e. '' when we assessed the downlink data this morning we were excited to see that chemcam did a great job with some very precise pointing in the previous plan .
at location e '' we have been focused on understanding small-scale features like the tiny crystals and veins seen in the above chemcam rmi image .
today 's plan will complete the detailed work on this outcrop and then we 'll bump to a new location to assess a transition from gray to red bedrock .
i was the sowg chair today and we had a fairly straightforward planning day .
on the first sol curiosity will acquire 4 more carefully pointed chemcam observations to assess compositional variations in bedrock a vein and dark nodules along with supporting mastcam documentation .
then we 'll acquire mahli images of the target funzie '' and one more mahli image on rona '' to assess small textural differences in the bedrock and veins that are present here .
just for funzie '' we 'll do an overnight apxs analysis .
on the second sol we 'll acquire a mastcam multispectral mosaic of the area that we 're bumping towards in order to better understand the color differences and the transition from gray to red bedrock in this area .
then curiosity will drive 5 m to the south to set up for contact science in the weekend plan .
the plan also includes a number of environmental monitoring observations to look for clouds and variations in dust in the atmosphere .
one of the mastcam atmospheric observations is coordinated with a themis observation which is pretty cool to think about multiple spacecraft studying mars from the ground and orbit .

this makes me think that the poison is n't actually meant to kill anyone .

unlike the stock market which is seeing its eight-year bull run thanks in part to institutional investors crypto-markets are dominated by individual investors .
the burgeoning opportunities for institutional investment as blockchain use-cases become more prevalent expect increased institutional investment in cryptocurrency markets .
the real growth driver will be institutional investments which will be spurred on by the individual investors who want to participate in crypto markets through institutional platforms and by the market forces that make the possibility of considerable profits too essential to pass up .

i 've been re-reading the sarah conly paper seduction rape and coercion https www.bowdoin.edu/faculty/pdf/seduction_rape_and_coercion.pdf since this grace-ansari conversation began .
i finished reading it this evening and the conclusion really helped to clarify for me what i find objectionable not only in the initial reporting of the story but also in the way in which we as a society are talking about it .
i 'd like to share it with you here maybe it will help clarify things for you as well .
we need to expand our conceptual framework and our terminology so that we can capture greater differences than we typically do .
a cultural tradition which has divided sexual intercourse into either
that there are many finer distinctions which we need to recognize and
where we recognize actions of deceit hurtfulness and damage which
are not the worst of transgressions and yet which are not morally neutral .
we know generally that there is a difference between actions which a
infringe others ' rights say stealing b do n't infringe others ' rights
but are nonetheless wrong like failing to give to someone in need
c are not wrong but which nonetheless evince bad character giving
to the needy but only to feel your own superiority and d are none
of these yet may nonetheless be regrettable for their repercussions .
we need to understand is that sex is at least as complex as other areas of human interaction and has just as many varieties of wrong as well as
of good and as we have been accustomed to differentiate within other areas of human interaction so should we here .
to subsume all areas of sexual wrong under the heading of rape
it hurts those whose laudable goal is just to show that sex can be dark and hurtful they lose credibility when they are perceived as exaggerating and their perfectly appropriate criticisms of sexual practice may be dismissed .
it is bad for those who are the aggressors in any sexual situation who may feel that as long as they have not committed rape their actions are morally neutral they need to learn that actions outside of rape can be despicable and to cultivate awareness as to which are and which are not morally acceptable
to call all sexual wrongdoing rape also does a disservice to those who have suffered the absolute terror of violent assault and
whose suffering ca n't i think be compared to that of the person who has reluctantly agreed to have sex to avoid emotional distress .
be a case where analytical philosophy with its conceptual distinctions and semantic precision can indeed explain something to our sense of

the core mechanics of the game are about the only part of the game that is n't a broken and buggy mess .
while i agree learning proper techniques for funnelling and such will benefit players we should not have to alter the way we play the game to compensate for newly introduced broken mechanics .

ok ... are you actually saying jews are n't indigenous to palestine ?
and the fact that herzl jabotinsky etc clearly demonstrates that .
herzl is n't the god king who decides everything about jews .
for centuries the jewish people have considered israel their homeland and longed to return there .
given jews are clearly not a non-dominant sector of society in israel and the palestinian territory the definition of indigeneity explicitly excludes them .
jews spent literally centuries under the muslim boot heel .
is your argument seriously that once the nations gain independence they 're no longer indigenous ?

the same lack of representation of the other side can be said about any of the scientology documentaries .
the fact is this is how these people were treated and it either is or is not an accurate representation .
if it is not how they were treated it is an inaccurate representation and calling it out on those grounds is fair and even important .
if however the representation of what they went through is not a lie then all i can say is 'if the shoe fits ' .
i would of course incourage anyone making a judgement solely based on this documentary to do some research on the subject first .
the other important thing is to make it clear that not all hassidic sects are represented by this movie and as usual no individuals should be judged based on this movie other than those who are represented accurately .

i went and listened to it on my lunch specifically because you said you liked it and you 're right it 's a great song .
the most direct empirically rigorous statement is that taxes are needed to correct market externalities .
be fore we chose an alternative to a less than optimal option we should see if that alternative is comparatively better and not just assume the alternative can be implemented optimally .
externalities and other market failure are the exceptions in markets .
public choice economics shows they are the norm in government .
market failure exists because individuals are making decisions much of whose cost or benefit goes to someone else .
that situation sometimes occurs on the private market but on that market it is the exception not the rule .
most goods are ordinary private goods so the producer can convert much of the benefit to the buyer into a benefit to himself via the price he charges .
most production uses inputs—labor raw materials capital land—that the producer can only use if he compensates their owners for what they give up by letting him use them which means that his cost measures the cost that his use imposes on them .
in the standard model of perfect competition which assumes away problems such a public goods and externalities what the producer sells a good for turns out to be just what it is worth to the purchaser what he buys inputs for to be just what they are worth to the seller hence his private benefit is precisely equal to the social benefit—the total effect of his actions summed over everyone .
that is a simplified model of an economy but it is at least a first approximation of how a market economy works .
individual actors usually receive most of the benefit and pay most of the cost of their actions making market failure the exception not the rule .
on the political market individual actors—voters politicians lobbyists judges policemen— almost never bear much of the cost of their actions or receive much of the benefit .
hence market failure the exception on the private market is the rule on the political market .

so uncle sam has not been kind to us crypto junkies .
with the change of the tax code each transaction now is effectively taxed as income not capital gains meaning you can pay up to of 39.6 in federal taxes alone depending on which tax bracket you 're in and if you do not live in a state that does not have an income tax then the state is going to also want its fair share as well .
i first must say i 'm not a tax advisor and any information i divulge is food for thought .
with that in mind there are many ways to minimize your tax liability if you have a significant holding in bitcoin or any other crypto currency .
imagine many of the concepts and recommendations given by financial planners and tax experts to an individual that has won a large lottery jackpot still applies in this scenario .
lets say for example you have 5000 btc and a big smile on your face it would be ridiculously stupid to cash out any large amounts above 470,700 as uncle sam would be using the largest condom he has to rape you .
if you cash out lets say 10 million in btc you 're going to be paying nearly a little over 4 million in tax if you 're in an taxable income state .
if you 're in ny or cali then you should just move unless you do n't mind giving boat loads of money to politicians that spend it on everything under the sun .
lets say you take that same 10 million dollars and you were to cash out as an s corp lets say for example nakamoto 's cafe inc .
because this is a pass through tax structure in which case any money that you invest into the business is a tax write off for the most part .
at which case you and your spouse become employees of nakamoto 's cafe and each take a nice salary of 200,000 per year in which case the first 120k is taxed with social security .
your company will provide you and your spouse with 100 benfitits paid health insurance life insurance dental vision and a very nice 401k with 100 match up to the maximum federal limit at currently 18,500 for a total of 37k yearly contributions tax deferred .
your company is so great that they even provide you with a residence to pay rent free and covers all property taxes and utilities .
also very nice luxury company vehicles are provided to the executives with insurance covered and fleet gas card .
your company provides you with lavish first class airfare when you travel for your business purposes such as managing your bitcoin portfolio while sipping some coke and rum on the beach of fiji .
the company of course provides very nice computers and mobile devices so you can run maintain your business anytime anywhere .
ultimately there will be a time where you have to pay money on taxes for pass through distributions in which case if you manage your money correctly you will not have any distributions and will be able to maintain your lifestyle the way you like .
also keep in mind giving to charity is much better investment than giving to uncle sam to invest .
seriously we bomb a country only to pay to rebuild them ... lol
any who these are just thoughts based on recommendations i 've had from tax professionals and business lawyers .
i 'm sure this is easier said than done but from my understanding this type of stuff is done quite often by the super rich obviously .
please note that i 'm not encoring you to avoid taxes that would be stupid .
i am however encouraging you to be smart with your money as the system is obviously rigged in favor of those who understand it and know how to take advantage of it .
keep in mind you 're doing nothing legally wrong by paying the least amount of tax legally required of you
now that crypto currency is evolving and the sec is becoming interested in tokens and ico 's as they represent securities there is clearly a legal argument that crypto is not a property and is a security in which case would be taxed as capital gains and not income but hey we 'll have to see how this one plays out .

spencer and martha seem like the last two people in the world to get detention .
spencer was caught helping a friend cheat on his homework and martha talked back in gym when somebody had the audacity to try to make her participate in gym .
doing busy work in the basement of the school .
but spencer has other ideas once he finds the weird old game system on one of the shelves ... with a game called jumanji in it .
he convinces martha to try it with him despite her numerous objections and they 're immediately sucked into game .
after they 're initial shock they realize they 're talking to each other in very different bodies .
martha is quick to question why in the world she 's wearing half a shirt and short shorts in the jungle .
spencer is quite happy with his own changes though .
especially when he notices the list of strengths for his character .
imgur https i.imgur.com/davadjn.png and while he wo n't say it out loud he 's quite happy with hers as well .
he always had a crush on martha but now she looks like a famous actress .
and he ca n't keep his eyes off her breasts .
and while he knows this game is important and he 's supposed to be doing something he 's already having trouble focusing on that ...
for anybody who 's seen the new jumanji i 'm looking for a scene with just spencer and martha in the game .
or dr. smolder bravestone dwayne johnson and ruby roundhouse karen gillan depending on your perspective ...
but spencer will still be the nerdy gamer and martha will still be the shy bookworm .
and she 'll very much be the one who will immediately yell why am i wearing half a shirt and short shorts in the jungle ? ''
first let 's assume the game handles two players better .
so it will adapt and make it balanced and fair .
second this is dpp so it 's obviously going to be a slightly different version of the game .
i 'm thinking they 'll have some other strengths and weaknesses .
and we 'll obviously take things in a slightly different direction .
i 'm also looking for a version where ruby takes control .
bravestone might have all the strengths but spencer is a shy nerdy geek who 's completely smitten with the girl he 's now got to spend all his time with .
he 's also got all his real life weaknesses which in this case include and obsesses with breasts and cleavage and a big fetish for hypnosis and mind control .
and once ruby realizes how much she 's got him wrapped around her little finger she ca n't help but start experimenting a bit to see how far it goes ...
i 'm open to all genders for my other writer but i 'm looking to play dr. smolder bravestone spencer and want somebody else to play ruby roundhouse martha .
and feel free to message me if you see this much later .
i 'm often looking for new scenes and i 'm open to this or anything else i 've posted .
with the entire mining craze i am trying to think up new ideas amd can alleviate the problem .
how about putting their mobile vega dgpu that was recently announced 24cu with hbm2 4gig onto a x470 motherboard soldered ?
the mobile chip will have its own fan and perhaps even turn up the tdp to 100w with higher clocks connected to the cpu via 8x pci-e .
the lower tdp allocated vega gh part can overtake 1060 maxq by 7 13 per intel and maxq 1060 is 25 slower than a desktop 1060 .
so an overclocked vega 24cu should be 1060/rx580 grade performance .
you can toggle this part on/off in bios so you can upgrade when you want and use it as a backup when you want .
i think at times like this even die hard intel fans looking for a gaming pc would consider making the switch if a 1060 cost 600 dollars .
the only way to save gamers from miners is to make gpus un-scalable .
i have a sizable sum i 'd love to invest into sia £10k but am unable to sign up for bittrex .

in seasons 6-10 of red vs blue it 's revealed that one of the prominent characters church is an ai called alpha modeled off of the mind of the enigmatic director .
every other ai in the series at that time was revealed to be dissociated fragments the director had created by psychologically torturing alpha with simulated scenarios .
another character tex is also an ai called beta .
but it 's established that beta existed before the fragmentation experiments started .
what 's more is that beta is the only other ai to resemble a person .
beta was seemingly around since alpha was first created which was still years after allison 's death .
the series never makes it exactly clear what beta is or where she came from .
but now i think i know even if the series creators did n't .
if the director had such an unhealthy obsession with his loss such a degree of preoccupation that he developed a tulpa based off his idealized memories of allison .
if that was the case when his brain patterns were scanned to create alpha his tulpa 's patterns would have been scanned as well .
except after the two were translated into ai they would n't be bound to each other anymore .
so to recap one of the primary characters of red vs blue tex is an ai copy of a tulpa .
an unintended byproduct of scanning a brain that already had more than one mind .

i am wiiling to do all kinds of trade but i prefer pure keys
so i do n't know if any of you remember my late night vein-poppingly angry rant about a month ago regarding a geekvape medusa reborn rdta from 3fvape that promptly broke within 5 minutes of my opening it .
i bought it only for the fact that it has a squonk pin and as soon as i tried to screw it in the entire top half with the threading snapped off right at the spot where the threading begins and needless to say was completely fucked .
fast forward 1 entire month and i 'm still dealing with the idiots over at their customer service department .
i 've actually had 2 different people on 2 separate occasions tell me they 're sending it out within 3-7 business days and then nothing .
i replied to each complaint thread asking why it had not been sent out yet even though it had been 2 weeks which was an entire week after the latest said shipping date but got no reply after that until i went and started a completely new complaint thread asking why the hell they had n't replied to my message and where the fuck my squonk pin was .
and then the second person that answered my complaint email went and did the exact same fucking thing .
so basically if you are thinking of buying stuff online and going the cheap chinese vendor route do yourself a massive favor and just do n't use 3fvape .
fasttech has been nothing but amazing every time i 've had an issue and i ended up just buying a whole new medusa reborn rdta from them so hopefully it will be here soon .
i 've also contacted geekvape directly but they 're just dicking around stalling and taking forever to reply to every fucking email i send .
i do n't work for fasttech or any online vendor for that matter so i have no reason to bad mouth any company except for the fact that i feel like i 've been completely screwed over .
i know it 's not an expensive product but it comes down to common courtesy and basic customer service .
if you say you 'll do something then just fucking do it and do n't run me around for 4 goddamn weeks lying by telling me it 's been sent when you 're clearly just saying it to shut me up .
i 'd recommend heavengifts too but they 're a little higher priced and i 've not dealt with them personally .
there 's a reason their prices are like 3 cheaper than fasttech on a lot of things because that extra 3 ensures that if you get defective shit you might actually be able to do something about it .
tl dr 3fvape customer service might as well be non-existant for how much they do and on top of that they blatantly lie to customers to shut them up .
do yourself a favor and use some other company like fasttech .
the crystal towers of krypton rang out in a clear piercing noise that shook the clouds out of the sky .
glass shards tumbled from the skyscrapers above hailing the ground in a lethal rain .
the around kara turned black their bodies disintegrating into grey ash that floated away under the red sun .
she turned to her parents but their skin was melting away revealing a green and steel skeleton beneath the flesh .
a man watched from the crowd his eyes bright light stars .
to one side stood clark in his red and blue costume .
to the other side tali sat on a grassy hill .
she knew either of them could save her if only she walked over .
no '' she hissed standing her ground between them .
the dream around her shook and sundered breaking open as the planet did and kara jolted away on the computer desk .
nice you of to join us '' winn said his fingers typing away on the lab computer beside her .
you know this group project is due in less than 36 hours right ? ''
why do you think i 'm so low on sleep ? ''
kara retaliated the remnants of the dream evaporating as she turned to the code in front of her .
in reality she 'd found herself falling asleep at odd times since poison ivy 's attack .
not often but after four months of no sleep and over a year with barely any sleeping at all was odd enough .
her subconscious mind had been quick enough to remind her of the nightmares that awaited in the wings .
in an odd way she almost missed the dream-state from the black mercy before robin 's pesticide had turned the dreamland back into a horror .
sleep when the assignment is done '' winn said still unwilling to make eye contact .
we need a solid base on this project if we 're going to pass this course . ''
enough sniping '' babs said from the other side of the computer desk typing away on her laptop and the lab computer nearly simultaneously .
there 's still one whole day to go before this is done we have more than enough time to get some sleep in as well . ''
kara was n't quite sure that was why winn was being testy but she decided not to push the matter either .
truth was the relationship between them had been a little tense since new years when she 'd taken winn to clark 's party .
he 'd kissed her when the clock struck zero and she ... had panicked .
dick had teased her for a week about running away from that kiss until she threatened to tie him to a cell tower with his own grappling hook if he did n't knock it off .
but listening to the hurt in his voice she had to think he was right .
she 'd really hurt winn 's feelings that night by running away .
the only problem was she had no idea how to fix it .
babs is right '' kara said stifling a yawn .
i 'm going to grab a coffee and walk it off .
a few muttered requests for sugary caffeine later and kara was outside the computer lab on the snowy slushy sidewalk .
a sundollar coffee shop was just on the other side of the walkway already populated with students buried in laptops and loaded down with books but kara avoided it for now taking the path further from the bustling crowds and into the darker alleyways .
once she was out of sight of the people she took to the sky flying up into the clouds where the sun shone .
instantly the foggy haze of sleep slipped away along with the dark spectres that haunted it .
she sighed a breath of relief reclining back a little against a passing cloud bank .
it soaked through her sweater instantly the chill making her curse rao .
great '' she muttered to herself craning her neck to see the wet spot on her shirt .
now winn will wonder what the heck i was up to . ''
maybe the sun could dry it out as thin and cold as it was up there .
she flipped over reclining like she was on a bed made of air and pulled her phone out of her pocket .
her last messages with dick were still on the screen .
supergirl he just keeps claiming he is n't upset about it .
nightwing he might just be embarrassed that you keep bringing it up .
he put his feelings on the line and you ... were n't gentle..
unless you have n't told me about your new bf .
but i 'm just not interested in him that way !
nightwing seems to be a common trend with you you little heartbreaker .
supergirl i will tie you to that cell tower .
kara sighed dropping her head and letting her blonde hair dangle in the sky .
she thought about trying to remote into a lab computer from her phone but working on code on the tiny screen sounded awful .
instead she tabbed over to her voicemails listening to the first saved one .
i wanted to tell you this in person but you ran off and no one is quite sure where you went .
there 's a league emergency off-world something called warworld is heading for earth and it does n't sound pleasant .
i think green lantern and martian manhunter may end up following me so hopefully we can handle this ourselves but if we fail it 'll be coming for earth next .
i 've passed your number along to the remaining league members in case an emergency happens on earth .
kara groaned thumping her head into the imaginary ground below her .
intellectually she understood that he was possibly the most capable person on the planet to handle the threat and that he 'd had other teammates beside him .
batman had confirmed that martian manhunter and green lantern were behind him .
emotionally she felt abandoned by her last bit of family and convinced that he 'd already died off-planet weeks ago .
if he 'd waited another hour for her to get the message she could have gone along with him or at least told him everything she knew about the warworld .
but now she had nothing to do but worry .
frustrated but feeling restored she dropped back down to street-level walking into the sundollar 's line-up for coffee .
despite the length the line-up moved fast with the slowest part being while she waited for bab 's drink to be made .
her phone buzzed in her pocket and she rushed to answer it hoping clark was on the other end .
see if you can get to a more private location .
more important than my project due in 2 days ? ''
she asked tucking the phone under one ear to take the coffees from the barista .
she nodded a thank you as she headed out the door .
passing college students shot her strange looks as they walked by .
i wo n't say more while you 're in a public area .
get somewhere private and call me back on this number .
the phone went dead and kara cursed trying to juggle it back into her pocket without dropping the tray of coffees on the ground .
they nearly splashed all over her only for someone to grab the tray just in nick of time .
whoa careful there '' the girl said holding her tray while kara looked on sheepishly .
do n't want to be wearing your drinks . ''
i must be making a great first impression between today and new years . ''
your first kiss with a guy can always be a little overwhelming . ''
especially when you are n't expecting it '' kara muttered .
well in that case maybe you can help me out ?
i was in the computer lab with him but i just got a phone call and it 's really important .
do you think you can bring these drinks to him and the redhead beside him and tell them an emergency came up ? ''
want me to pass on any details or ... ? ''
kara asked costumed and flying high across the country .
the sun and the wind woke her up more than the coffee ever would have .
she 'd needed this more than she 'd even realized .
we have reports of monsters attacking the dome '' bruce said .
nothing consistent some witnesses are saying it 's demons others are claiming giants i 've seen one tweet claiming there 's a dragon in the air .
the only consistent thing is they seem to all be gravitating towards the dome .
i 've got the rest of the league already on scene but due to circumstances ''
the league ranks are looking a little thin ? ''
flash is on scene and he should n't even be out of bed . ''
nice to know i was so high on your list of emergency contacts . ''
were n't you the one telling me about the huge project you have due in two days ? ''
kara grumble was indistinguishable from the roar of the wind .
winn was going to be so annoyed at her especially if babs insisted on helping out in the wings .
but unlike babs and winn kara did n't need to sleep .
a couple hours worth of monster killing would get her brain ready to tackle that group project again .
san francisco was coming into sight now and kara could already feel a pit forming in her stomach .
plumes of smoke had already formed a dark cloud over the city causing lightning to crackle and arc through the smoke and grit and strike against the purple dome .
six months the dome had stood in the middle of the city and no one seemed any closer to knocking it down .
it seemed like humans really could get used to just about anything providing it did n't threaten their way of life too much .
the thought reminded her of poison ivy and her dangerous rhetoric but kara shook the thought out of her head .
there were people in danger here and now the worries of climate change could be a long term problem to solve .
speaking of the people kara swept down into the city streets her ears tuned to cries for help .
she found the voices quickly enough zipping through streets to find a building being crawled over by long-limbed gremlins .
inside a dozen scared faces pressed up against the glass staring out at the monsters that roamed the streets .
kara knocked the gremlins off the building smiling at the relief that now reflected on the faces .
the streets were crawling with more monsters leaving them nowhere to run and she was n't sure how many were already inside the building .
she motioned the people away from the window giving herself room to get some proper momentum .
the fear was sneaking back onto their faces but they moved off leaving her a clear path to smash out the window coming to a stop just inside .
one of the men in the crowd stepped forward .
or perhaps the rest had just huddled backwards a step kara was n't sure .
the fear in the room was palpable she had to find a way to defuse it .
i think the office is closed today due to monsters '' she began trying to inject a little levity into the situation .
a half-hearted chuckle was the best she got out of the group .
batman i have an office building full of civilians .
do we have an proper evacuation site for them to go to ? ''
sending the coordinates to your phone now '' batman responded .
kara checked it quickly then relayed the address to the man in front .
i 'm going to go ahead and clear out any more monsters '' she said once she was certain he knew where he was going as well as try to find anyone else in trouble and send them your way .
you 're going to lead these people to this address .
um yes '' the man said glancing around nervously .
she asked trying to set the man at ease .
well jefferson i 'm about to head downstairs from here .
in two minutes i want you to take these people and follow me . ''
she barely waited for the man 's confirmation flying down the staircase in search of more people ... or monsters .
but the building seemed mostly cleared save for a couple workers who had n't managed to leave in time .
she sent them to wait by the stairs for jefferson before checking outside .
even from the ground she could hear the wail of children the beating of wings and the clomping of hooves on the pavement .
and it did n't sound like pigeons or horses either .
a loose circle of gremlins was forming around her none of them looking too happy about their fall from the building .
kara stretched her arms out in front of her cracking her knuckles with a grin on her face .
i was worried i 'd have to go looking for you guys . ''
as if in response three of them lurched at her their movements awkward and gangly while still moving fast enough to catch the superheroine off guard .
despite that she managed to snatch two of them by their tails yanking them away as they clawed at her with dirty nails .
she snarled knotting the tails together as the third climbed up her back pulling her hair and cape reaching for her eyes .
she jerked her head to the side feeling the claws rake across her cheek leaving warm wetness behind .
she tossed the knotted gremlins aside knocking a fourth one out of the air and snatching the third one off her face by the scruff of its neck .
you made me bleed '' she said staring at the bloody claws .
that explains a lot '' supergirl replied ducking low as the loose gremlin tried to dive her again .
do we know how to get rid of them ? ''
flash has had some luck destroying them simply by running at them fast .
seems like a good impact will do it . ''
i 'm really good at hitting things hard . ''
there was a pause on the other end of the line and then .
kara smashed the gremlin into the pavement below her .
it did n't poof away like she 'd hoped but it did squish into the ground the ground wrapping around it like a vice .
i 'll be good '' she said turning off the com to look at the other gremlins around her .
the two with their tails tied together ran to either side of a lamppost comically bumping into each other before squabbling to choose a side .
but one look back at kara 's dangerous grin convinced the pair to work together climbing up the lamppost before leaping away onto a building .
kara called out an all clear taking to the sky to look for any other immediate threats .
looking down she noticed the small group of office workers had armed themselves with fire-axes table legs and other makeshift weapons .
they fanned out of the building looking ready to face anything .
i 'm not hearing anything dangerous between here and the refugee shelter '' kara said dropping down lower so she was n't shouting .
the civilians moved out cautiously watching all sides as she zipped ahead .
every block or two she 'd pick up the sounds of another human plucking them out of their homes and dropping them off with the growing group .
more monsters patrolled the path gargoyles and things she did n't have a name for but most were easily disposed of even if she could n't hope to completely defeat them .
a length of rebar from a nearby construction site proved useful for restraining the more ... persistent foes .
on it '' kara said looking at her ragtag group of survivors .
they were only a few blocks from safety and she could n't hear anything nearby but she hated to leave them all the same .
when she could see the survivors from the camp she flew off warning the workers there of the group coming in .
she headed towards the flash 's last known location .
she 'd only delayed a few moments but already she could see a pack of dark wolf-like creatures advancing on the flash 's red costume .
they growled at the fallen man their body language showing fear and anger at the same time .
these must have been the ones the flash had desummoned by running into them .
it seemed almost criminal to not give it a shot .
she ramped up her speed pushing to move as quickly as she had versus bronze tiger one fist out in front of her .
time almost seemed to slow down the beasts moving at a crawling pace as she landed on it .
her impact turned the monster into a dark smoke poofing away satisfyingly .
the other monsters stopped their growling looking to where their packmate had stood moments ago replaced by a girl on one knee her fist to the cracked pavement below and blood hair settling around her .
found the flash '' kara huffed into her headpiece .
so she could replicate the speedster 's method of disposal ...
but the effort was almost too exhausting to make it worthwhile .
breathing but unconscious '' kara replied checking the man over for bleeding or other signs of trauma .
bring him to central city hospital then get back here .
that almost felt improbable to kara but then she 'd only spotted a handful of the creatures reportedly in the area .
despite her best efforts to hurry it was already dark by the time she got back to the dome .
not a speedster like him supposedly the rest of them had run off to africa to handle a giant gorilla .
but a possible contact for her all the same with talk about pulling her in to help with situations .
the dark storm clouds above the dome crackled ominously purple lightning striking the dome at regular intervals .
it looked even creepier in the dark somehow the clouds blotting the stars from the sky making it dark despite the full moon .
she arrived just in time to knock a charging centaur off its feet just yards before it crashed into batman and a group of civilians he was leading to safety .
she slammed into a nearby garden with the centaur uprooting an entire tree .
i had that '' batman said gruffly as she walked over .
in response bruce gestured to the black line tied around the base of the tree wrapped around a fire hydrant on the other side of the street at thigh level .
had kara not arrived the centaur would have tripped over the line unable to stop on time .
do n't you have some place better to be ? ''
he 's our best chance at ending this permanently .
and i 'm eager to hear what 's been taking him so long . ''
on it '' kara said taking to the skies .
ahead of batman she spotted another monster between him and the refugee camp a golem made of steel .
she focused her eye beams on it melting its feet and legs into a pile of slag on the ground before flying off .
no reason to let batman have all the fun .
she found john constantine beside the dome in a rare space of quiet beside a dead man smoking a cigarette down to the bitter filter .
but with her eyes on the ground she had barely noticed the scene in the sky .
it looked like the storm cloud had opened up pouring forth a legion of beautiful winged men and women .
it looked like a scene out of a church or a movie .
that took you awhile '' constantine said as she landed .
yeah i asked bats to send me some volunteers to go fight that heavenly host we 're about to face . ''
he chewed the end of the cigarette as he spoke spitting it out into the grass when the plastic began to burn .
no sense burning down the last patch of green grass in the city .
i think i 'm all that 's coming '' kara said .
she had spotted the other hero moments earlier as she punched the dragon that had been flying over the city .
kara would never admit it but she felt more than a little jealous of her .
and heaven might not like negotiating with another pantheon . ''
kara cocked her head curiously inviting a crazy grin to the man 's face .
kara shrugged grabbing the man under the armpits and hauling him into the air towards the heavenly host .
kara shrugged grabbing the man under the armpits and hauling him into the air towards the heavenly host .
constantine yelled pointing at the angelic nun who stood in front of kara .
not that the man had been terribly clear what to do next .
she did the first thing that came to mind flying forward to punch the angel in the jaw .
she cried in the name of our lord ! ''
her vision filled with white wings and feathers buffeting her about in a dizzying flurry .
perhaps the angels did n't believe in aliens either like constantine had insisted .
even still she was hardly the only refugee from off-planet hanging around .
she 'd met one just last month at clark 's new year 's party .
assuming they both got out of this alive she resolved to prove that she was n't from earth to the man .
it was near impossible to fight back against the onslaught of angels but luckily she did n't have to for long .
she was n't sure what but the sound of it was so great she thought she was deaf at first until the quiet was replaced by a buzzing ringing noise .
the angels were blasted off of her and in the wake of the sound all she could see was the purple outer shell of the dome falling away leaving the pink interior in place .
and then even smaller beside it she saw john 's falling figure .
she took off pushing herself to fall even faster than he was faster than gravity alone could take her .
even then she was worried she was going to be too slow that he was going to hit the ground before she could reach him or worse that she 'd reach him and have no time to slow his descent .
that he 'd hit her arms and be neatly sliced into three even parts .
the ringing in her ears got worse with the roar of the wind and she found herself having to course correct to stop from veering into the dome and setting off another ringing sound wave .
she caught him just feet from the ground grabbing at an arm as he fell .
she felt the bone pull out of the socket but he was safe .
even as she carried john to the nearest encampment she could see all the monsters leaving some evaporating where they stood others just running away from the dome instead of towards it .
a cheer was going up in the crowd just as daylight started to break over the city .
winn was going to be so mad at her .
i 've heard base speed does not affect finisher speed but that info was from a while ago .
i 'm talking about ps4 here so it might be different for pc
i was trying to exclusively use this gun since the update and found the hitscan way better than before usually if you feel like that shot has to hit it will .
however the gun still feels weak and clunky to use on console at least the scope barely gives much view and the damage is outclassed heavily by all other ar 's even the common one .
this is just my opinion i 'm sure some people are having great success with it especially on pc as i 've heard it 's really use to use a scope with m/kb .
feel free to add me or send me a trade offer !
iv'e tried all sorts of different weapons and doing little to no damage
any tips before i 'm running out of cash ?
or if any one want 's to jump in and lend a hand that would be nice
why was carm trying to get furio a girlfriend when she was crushing on him so hard ?
was it just a way to innocently interject herself into his life in someway like with his new house ?
i bought a new case and transferred all of my components into it last night as well as replacing my psu with a 650w modular and my stock intel cooler with the hyper 212 evo but now i 'm getting very annoying stutters in games that were smooth yesterday .
for example before i did my upgrades i got a very stable 60 fps in assassins creed origins but after my upgrade i 'm getting drops from anywhere to 5-40 fps every few seconds and it 's very annoying .
did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise ?
it 's not a story the jedi would tell you .
darth plagueis was a dark lord of the sith so powerful and so wise he could use the force to influence the midichlorians to create life ...
he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying .
the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural .
he became so powerful ... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did .
unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep .
he could save others from death but not himself .
my second ken follet after fall of giants so i had really high hopes i did n't like it quite as much as giants but it was still a great read .
my favourite character was aliena and i really enjoyed reading william 's pov as well what a complete bastard !
i have just discovered historical fiction and loved going online to check which bits were fact like the assassination of the archbishop of canterbury nice detail having william hamleigh fictional character take part in the real life assassination with the real killers .
the payment process for youtube is done through cpm clicks per mille so you 'll get paid x for every thousand people who viewed the video playing the advert .
with the new policy essentially reducing the amount of monetized profiles .
would this cause a change in the average cpm ?
i 'm having an issue accessing the web ui for qbittorrent from any computer on the lan save localhost where the actual qbittorrent program is running .
every attempt to visit the page from another computer/device on the lan is met with the rather standard host took too long to respond '' message regardless of whether i route the qbittorrent traffic through a vpn .
torrent connections work fine whether standard or through a vpn but ideally i 'm trying to set this up so that i can run torrents through the vpn but still access the web ui from any computer on the lan remote access via internet is not important .
any ideas what the stumbling block here could be ?
it may be a charity auction but really you need that electric toothbrush for 60 !
so earlier y'all helped me decide a tarp over a water proof bivy .
y'all are so helpful i 've decided to ask if anyone has experience with the mld monk tarp it seems like a good deal .
i am mainly curious if there 's a better priced option out there for a cuben fiber tarp .
i 'm about ready to pull the trigger so any advice will be appreciated !

i used to love graphic design art guitar but i found when my ex girlfriend left me also an artist i no longer had inspiration .
designing was 100x harder bored of guitar didnt feel creative at all .
the thing is i didnt see she was my muse until she left .
since then i have realised when i have a great connection with a girl i come alive and when i dont have a girl in my life its like im dead creatively .
i have always been a creative person but now being single and grown apart from my mates i have no inspiration to keep my creative juices flowing .
i used to be surrounded by people that inspire me and its only in the last few years ive realised most people suck the fucking life out of me .
i realise i dont need a muse for being in a creative field i need one for my soul on a day to day basis .

have to go through school with all the couples ' handholding and stuff .
and also the putting red paper hearts on peoples ' lockers '' thing .
last year i had to sit on the train for almost an hour while the couple next to me were making out and moaning like they were inches away from taking their clothes off .
it 's unbelievably depressing that some big commercial campaign can make me feel so lonely and depressed .
so for as long as i remember 7 8 ish when i go to sleep i can hear a very high pitch wine .
one night it was so bad i turned off and unplugged all electrical items in my room and it miraculously stopped .
i some times call it the sound of silence or the sound of electricity .
but some times i ca n't help but focus on it as i sleep and it gets louder .
just wondering if this is a asd thing or something else ?
grandmas and grandpas are aware of our views but we have a symbiotic relationship with them .
when my daughter asks me why i do n't go i simply tell her that i do n't believe in god that it 's a choice .
i was raised a catholic and found my own way .
i am a fervent atheist but how do i proceed from here ?
i love to cook and usually add a bit of something yummy but dog-healthy to their dishes when i feed my beasties .
one thing that guarantees that those bowls will all be totally spotless after breakfast or dinner is if i make a thai curry they like red yellow and green and i have n't tried other types and pour some of the broth on their food .
not too much my gf has a far lower spice tolerance than i but noticeable .
the current batch was spicier than intended gf could finish her bowl but it took her a while .
does anyone else have dogs that like spicy food ?
it does n't seem to upset their stomachs and they 're all pretty old and in fact the eldest dogge seems to have fewer problems with incontinence after curry than after ... well almost anything else .
do dogs even taste capsaicin spice like humans do ?

anyone having issues with pop up ads after a race ?
these would normally be tolerable but they will occasionally not load a close button .
as for me i 'm a bit exhausted and busy these days i could barely post or even write a comment here as frequent .
too busy that i did n't even have the time to watch the latest boruto 's episode let alone the latest manga chapter lol .
but do n't worry i 'm always lurking around here as usual and i think i can participate in this sub like before asap once i 'm getting used with my new work

how do i bounce without accidentally landing the wrong way on his dick ?
also it kinda hurts my knees like really bad ?

like it makes me feel like the equivalent of a twisted ankle but my knees ?
i have had this problem with multiple sones some being because they are old and a set tempo is n't required just so long as they are together and some being because the song is supposed to sound dumb .
an example of the first one would be dancing in the moonlight by king harvest and an example for the second would be the derp song .
the issue is that they both do n't stay on the tempo and i need them to .
is there a way to even the tempo be it through a daw or a program that does it automatically ?
edit i should add that i am using lmms for this song .
not the best software to use but it 's free so i like it .
i 'll preface this by saying i 'm unfamiliar with the fob system .
i 'm infiltrating on the support platform but i do n't know how to finish it .
i get past the first three platform and make my way to the objective .
it says it 's underground but i ca n't find a way to access it .
is there a button or an elevator i have to get to ?
my pc has stopped posting and i 've determined that somehow my mobo died so i 'm in desperate need of a new one to pair with my 4790k would like to get something comparable to the gigabyte z97x gaming 3 if possible .
not looking to spend more than 100 but hit me with offers !
have n't heard anything in 2018 yet and i 've been seriously itching for an update .
is there anything new going on since the post in december/2017 ?
it all works no leaks but with one odd thing
i could try to post a youtube if that helps you .
i do n't really mind this just want to be sure
i 'm not going to suffer later by ignoring it .

people i 've talked to have told me to start with books on pagan and wiccan witchcraft and that it 's very complicated the pagan sources i get and are somewhat familiar with through mythology and things like the odyssey and iliad but wicca while seemingly similar seems to be its own thing .
admittedly the only exposure i 've had with wicca is reading on some websites and i knew some wiccans in high school .
some of my pagan friends now years later obviously also practice wicca as well and have been very helpful .
i 'm all for getting my hands on every piece of information i can to do this right but the ancient greeks were n't wiccan .
while i do n't doubt there are many things involved in worship it seems easy relatively to learn but hard to master not complicated .

he is focusing in on the historical scholarship surrounding those letters which most certainly did concern themselves with protestant thought since many of those scholars and english translators were protestant .
i do n't think he is intending only to discuss the current state of academic interpretations of paul .
that 's just my reading based on having read the entire intro to his translation as well as a good bit of the translation itself .
i think the only opponent '' he is working against in this case is the soteriology found in historic protestantism where justification '' is found in faith intellectual assent and further in a manner predestined before birth .
this point is only to serve as a tangible and well understood example of how theological commitments can impact translations and textual critique .

looks like a shutdown may be imminent here so what would a government shutdown mean for equities ?
although a government shutdown sounds scary the reality is it has largely been a non-event historically for equities .
going back nearly 40 years the median return during shutdowns has been exactly flat .
not to mention the last shutdown in 2013 saw an impressive 3.1 gain in the s p 500 .

a they 're not psychologically ready to go back to work so may well need some sort of financial help if possible and
b as i said there 's no evidential basis that giving them financial help negatively affects their mental health outcomes .
you 're welcome to believe otherwise and i 'm not going to spend the time convincing you as it 's clear you have some kind of ideological opposition to providing a wideranging financial safety-net .
yes some people fall through the cracks and live in misery and every time that happened it fucking killed me .
but nobody is encouraged just to sit at home and fester and if we had more mental health resources we could do a lot more to intervene in those cases i.e .
more home visits more individual therapy and so on .
but we do n't mental health is tragically underfunded and deprioritised and sometimes we fail .
unless you 're saying we should just tell everyone just deal with it '' and pick up the pieces for those that ca n't then the least we can fucking do is offer the same terms to everybody .

i think the hepatotoxicity risks of cassia cinnamon get over hyped a bit i 've been guilty of this as well .
if you look at one of the sources from that video toxicology and risk assessment of coumarin focus on human data '' only a small subset 1-10 of the population seems to be susceptible
the published data is consistent with the existence of a
subgroup of the human population that reacts sensitively to coumarin with hepatotoxic effects .
if recurrent blood sampling is used to monitor liver enzyme levels this group may amount to a single-digit percentage of the population much higher than in drug responses often classified as ‘‘idiosyncratic '' .
no clear-cut dose-dependent increase in severity of the effect was observed within the subgroup although liver failure was observed only in patients treated with high doses more than 100 mg daily . ''
and given that the average coumarin content out of 170 cinnamon powders they tested from a market in the same study was 2.68 mg/g cinnamon with a max of 8.79 mg/g that would require 37g of cinnamon/day for the average and 11g/day for the maximum to reach 100mg coumarin/day .
i think it 's fair to say most people do n't reach that level of cinnamon consumption on a regular basis .

it 's a way of giving p2p guilds an advantage which is n't necessarily a bad thing for the health of the game .
for a long time p2p had no advantage anywhere f2p could hit max rank in arena and complete all raids .
p2p should get something for their money they pay for the game the rest of us enjoy for free !
rolo and ipd farming slowed because of tb decreasing frequency
imperial trooper mission in dstb is way too hard .
the intention was for tb to be relevant for a long time but guilds were ripping through the rolo mission and making progress on her too quickly .
so they slowed the cadence and increased the difficulty to give a small boost to p2p guilds .
once again this probably helps the health of the game while not preventing f2p from making progress on those toons .
vegans do n't claim to not be causing suffering .
i 'm not a self righteous hypocrite i 'm just someone that made small changes to my lifestyle in an effort to reduce my harm .
animals do die in the process of harvesting plants but vegans minimize this suffering and death compared to meat eaters since farm animals require tons of plants in order to grow to their maximum weight in order to then be slaughtered and eaten .
ideally we would find a way to farm that did not involve killing any animals whatsoever but for now that 's not possible on a large scale .
also i do grow some of my own food .
in any case i 'm not a hypocrite because i never claimed that i 'm completely eliminating animal suffering and death .
i 'm simply trying to avoid causing it whenever i can .
also sorry to hear about your crohn 's disease that 's not very fun .

your story is truly inspiring.. just read your first post my 2yr old son is named jackson too !
the most valuable part of the whole deal is the honor of something your grandfather had continuing to have ongoing practical use to you today .
there is a true inheritance and value to using the same thing your grandfather used before you for a practical purpose .
it functionally supported him through experiences we can only ever imagine .
the most reverent use it could be put to is performing the same use for the future generation .
to me this kind of symbolic passing and use of an item has way more intrinsic value than shoving it in a perfectly protected environment never to be made use of again .
the value of the object is in what it was used for and sidelining that use because you want to keep it safe insults everything that object went through to get into your hands in the first place .
nothing lasts forever so why not make it mean as much as it possibly while it lasts instead of sticking it on a dusty shelf and saying good 'nough '' ?
i forgot to add that the waste was general waste .
so they have old packaging boxes etc taken away by gregg 's themselves .
then food waste goes somewhere separate and i know some food places if not all have a wastage sheet that they fill out at the end of the day .
but it 's still edible food so different places have different things they do with it i suppose .
so the bins out side are bagged rubbish from inside the shop .
and most likely comes from the bins in the back of the shop like the kitchen area or behind the counter .

yay you proc it for less damage than you could and then you sit there and auto while any other champ who actually has benefits for staying in a fight like jax irelia or darius shits on you .
lets not forget that even the adc will 1v1 you with less trouble than they would have against actual sustained damage dealers .
if you are assuming full ad means go in get a kill and die than you are missing the point of talon .
if the republicans do n't have enough votes to cloture debate then the shit show intensifies .
thank you for taking the time to refute that bullshit .
conor walks to the octogon and the winner of khabib/ferguson is expected to fight again right there and then
yes the concorde traveled faster but that was supersonic requiring huge amounts of energy and therefor money which is why they do n't fly anymore .
on top of that super sonic flight is only allowed over uninhabited areas like the sea mostly .
if you would allow it everywhere on a daily basis you could say goodbye to your windows and eardrums probably too .
i think he means the replay file not the highlight file
not because their ship was attacked by a hostile force .
not because they were preforming an inherently dangerous training mission .
they died off the cost of a friendly county .
they died while waiting to enter a friendly port .
they died in a collision with a friendly ship .
they died in a collision that investigators called preventable .
as long as it is over 5 the dog and i get bundled up and go for a walk .
anything below that and the dog does n't like to be outside .
relationships where one party is gone for extensive periods of time is not for everyone especially people who are in a fragile place who need daily support .
not your fault but maybe just not the right situation for her
i feel like the hornets always needs at least one plumlee on their roster .
producing counterfeit usd or euros is a real good way to earn yourself some serious economic sanctions .
in the end unless you 're already a pariah state like north korea it just is n't worth it .
can someone also see if onondaga stickmaker alf jacques is there ?
you 'd be getting like 3silver per quest in the beginning
you could only farm that gold amount if you get to max level or close .
so do n't go for it if you are not planning to subscribe .
there are tons of other games that will fit you but not wow .
anyways alot of this realization is after the fact since discovering this sub .
but the point is after i showed empathy towards his experiences he was able to show respect towards asian women in response .
it 's one of the shocking things that opened my eyes to this whole issue with white worshipping and ingrained casual racism to people of asian descent .
i assumed there would be gas lighters or people downplaying core issues addressed in hapas but i was shocked by how much .
it was sickening how so many wm and aw especially asian activists completely dismiss or often outright insult issues hapas face .
it was n't even criticizing the tone or the methods some hapas express themselves by .
it was the fact that they were asian men .
completely ignoring that many have white fathers dismissing the fact that the issues they speak about come from their own personal lives and the complete lack of empathy from wmaf who will have hapa children themselves .
it 's truly telling of the inherent toxicity of the wmaf dynamic .
some players might use more than one knife or i might have noted them down incorrectly .
i did it just as i watched the matches so it might not be 100 .
some players did n't get shown as much as others so they might have used multiple knives or a different knife depending on the side .
happy to get feedback if i am entirely wrong on any of them though i doubt i got every single one right .
i did them by sight so i must have mistaken shahzam 's fade for a doppler sorry .
needless to say it is a better composition than the wd .
rats are fed hyper-purified diets that are similar in certain respects to the western diet but are worse .
they 're typically fed protein powders refined oil refined sugar some cellulose powder or other fiberous powder for the fiber intake as opposed to veggies and some vitamins .
there is nothing resembling whole foods in these diets .
even the people worst diets eat some non-hyper-processed eggs fruit meat veggies etc .
there 's a listing of ingredients here that google wo n't let me copy .
hmmmm i will consider it ahhaha.have to train it to 120 first but thanks for the suggestion !
itt people getting really emotional and mike being the only one talking sense .
i assume you will be able to but i ca n't give you a definite answer
at some point in history someone squirted out some lotion thought hey that looks funny and posted the caption you see above it in this image skin so dry even my lotion is praying for strength .
the pic has gone around facebook for years and now this lady has seen it and added it to her shill post .
all i was trying to say is it 's not accidental it 's entirely on purpose .
i 'm not sure why my comment got you so defensive i was n't trying to be rude .
i tried making biofuel for my ia and got a 7 on it so that could be an option
i live in washington so i watch a lot of the hawks .
i think if you take away russ and give you guys almost any qb in the league you would 've been somewhere around 6-10 or 7-9 .
he slips out of so many sure-fire negative plays and turns them into big gains it 's incredibly frustrating to watch as a fan of a division rival .
my step aunt and uncle have one in myrtle beach sc that they like for the same reason .
they also let my parents use it if they are n't using it .
we always went there a lot on summer vacations and my parents still do so it works out well for them .
only thing i do n't like about it is the crowded beaches it creates .
we usually used to vacation a little ways south of there in a small town garden city in a house where you have a semi-private area of beach .
i mean it 's a public beach but not as many people right in front of your house .
i had n't been there in probably 15 years .
hi i 'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image
in my opinion it is a 'it depends ' answer .
i am going to start with 'cartridge ' games .
this falls under the firmware type software for fair use determination .
in this case it could be argued the license for use was on the hardware in the cartridge and therefore copying to other hardware represents placing on an unlicensed computer .
this is a grey area and would likely have dependencies on your ability to use the original cartridge in hardware as designed .
for instance original atari 2600 cartridges would be far easier to argue to copy/modification was necessary to allow inter-operability or operability .
a much newer cartridge where there is still hardware readily available to read it and use it as designed would have a more difficult time making this claim .
relative cases for this are lexmark v. static control components galoob toys v. nintendo and sega v. accolade industries .
this is more likely to be legal as it is a format change of the exact unmodified code base for personal use only .
since you do not have the hardware interaction of proprietary rom 's it can not be claimed to be licensed to a specific piece of hardware .
lastly if there is a firmware lock which requires specific hardware to run and you are emulating this without authorization or bypassing this you would be defeating the owners anti-distribution security methods and therefore run afoul of copyright laws .
again you may be able to make a hardware accessibility claim to bypass this but it would be an uphill battle .
disclaimer this is strictly my opinion and should not be considered legal advice consult your own attorney for definitive advice .
i ca n't really get off to something i know girls do n't find pleasurable .
this is n't wolf of wallstreet or the big short .
it is absurd that so many have to come up with some dramatic narrative to explain every bit of price action .
there is not as much institutional money as you might think right now .
while there are large players capable of moving the price and do just that that 's not what 's going on here .
buyers likely do n't find this price low enough and sellers are probably not sure if we 're about to have another bull run .
breakouts do n't happen until price approaches and breaks previous levels of resistance or support and we 're right in between right now so not much volume .
just an fyi i have an ultrawide 1440 and an rx 580 8gb and run everything on low to maintain constant 80 .
night and rain are the main stresses on the system .
anything worth doing is worth doing correctly and i believe this is absolutely worth doing .
not sure about a deer but cloud and antenna caps would be great !
if this sees fruition i plan on a looooot of novelties .
lastly ... in the key of c let 's say i want to find the secondary dominant to the ii chord right ... . this note is in the key of c. but the chord you play for that note is dm not a d. so i guess my question is why not build a minor triad with a seventh if you 're temporarily borrowing the key of the chord you 're playing ?
i love the guitar in the corner peaceful place to play an acoustic .

also open-faced sandwiches are just pieces of bread or not with shit on top they are n't even sandwiches .
trump has claimed repeatedly that he supports dreamers and wants them to say .
therefore he cant claim that this was the sticking point .
in fact its trump 's own doing that made daca an issue .
this would not be an issue if he did not do that .
he has had 3 fights at 170 and in 2 of those he got outmuscled and overpowered .
he is a career lightweight the vast majority of his career has been at 155 .
the only reason that fight took place at 170 was because nate could n't train and cut weight in 11 days .
it was n't conor fighting a legit welterweight it was 2 lightweights fighting without a weight cut .
there 's a difference between fighting at 170 against another lightweight and fighting a career welterweight .
it 's annoying how you can not go beyond your simplistic black-and-white understanding and think for a moment .
well we know hera survives post rotj so we can see her for a while .
she 's actually gon na be in an upcoming issue of doctor aphra .
sabine could easily be a prominent character in a mandalorian centric book/comic .
and is n't there still gon na be a new animated show after this ?
that would be a great budget ce for tamamo .
i fell down my 2 story house 's staircase when i was 6 and had to get 4 stitches in my chin because i busted it open .
this is the reason i talk about veganism with next to no one in real life .
literally none of those are reasons to dislike him not liking someone for what their job decides to do for them and how they actually in their own time is fucking stupid
i the stronger your immune system the less symptoms you get ?
so 20 year olds would have less severe reactions than 40 year olds right ?
a big thing i want to bring up is the trials mode .
even though volume one and 2 may not be completely up to date they 're worth going through .
my advice when you do though is to ignore the jump attack almost all of them start with at first to get a hang of what you want to do when you hit the ground .
minkah will play deep and peppers towards the line so get your meme out of here .

i have actually not tested that but im pretty sure that it would work well .
you can cut the thing from belows the mana tide totem one feral spirits and one azure drake .
that would transition the deck into a full aggro list and you probably wan na squeeze in finley too somewhere .
that 's what i would come up with without testing though

yeah i think courtney is the only other hope to win .
i 'm just thinking of bear 's win this format loves this kind of character ...
u/lotus_blossom this is the second time that one of your comments has made me scoff out loud on the same damn thread

he knows content extremely well i think he just sees the type of videos say chaps or pft has put out going to games and does n't see quality or numbers .
he knows at the least throwing this out on the radio will create clicks posts and content if he does it or not .
dave gets bashed on here a lot but he clearly knows content better than anyone there
paywave is just a fancy term for payments using nfc .
if applepay works i 'd imagine you are fine because samsung pay does both nfc and magstripe emulation not just the latter .
it 's good that groups like this exist that let people who have fallen for mlms work together to try to get out of the hole and exit the mlm scheme .
are any people in these groups discussing the idea of mounting a legal battle to get the companies that have defrauded them taken down ?
i mean if you 've got a facebook group full of people who have been defrauded by a particular mlm and they 're not all in denial then you already have the basis for organizing a class-action lawsuit .
you have the plaintiffs all in one place where they can discuss and organize .
honestly going to a elite school isnt that bug of deal .
i hate this whole idea that all that matters is test scores and gpa .
i went to a top highschool in texas with a graduating class of 1200 .
so many of these kids fought like it was literally life of death to make the top 10 of their class .
it was do stupid i had a lot of people like op here crying that they didnt make it to yale or mit and that theyll have to settle for georgia tech ut or rice .
a lot of them went as far as taking drugs and by the end of highschool a lot of them ended with so many health problems .
a few of them couldnt even take it anymore and ended up committing suicide .
im not a lazy bum but im also not a genius .
i graduated in the 51 percentile of my school with a 3.33 gpa .
not once in highschool did i give a shit about my gpa i didnt even look at it until i graduated .
i did take my time to enjoy what i learned in every class i took cause thats why i go to school for to learn something new that i wouldnt have the opportunity anywhere else .
i ended going to a community college took it slow got a 3.97 .
i got accepted to a few elite schools and now im still to this day enjoying everything i get the opportunity to learn .
i still work hard but i dont stress myself out so much to the point where all that matters is have the highest gpa .
what he said about a disaster draft is true .
the team who suffered a loss of more than 15 player would be a disaster '' but if it 's less than 15 it 's a near-disaster '' and no draft is held .
from wikipedia it says for a disaster '' the commissioner would determine whether to cancel the team 's schedule for the season .
if the team 's season is canceled the team would have the first pick in the next regular draft a special draft would also be held in which each team would be able to protect 32 players ''
i had a similar bit of fortune a few months ago the company i was at was starting to turn shitty and i started looking elsewhere including a long shot application that ended up coming through .
now i work on battle.net as a senior sde .
as much as i want the decoupling to happen i am okay with it waiting until after we have scaling .
when eth takes the lead i want it to be functionally kick ass as a first impression to those outside of crypto .
first this is a budget resolution not a daca deal or immigration reform bill lol .
no such immigration bill or bipartisan daca deal exists yet .
senate democrats and republicans already passed a budget resolution .
the house democrats have zero objections to the budget resolution passed by the senate but they want to do a schumer shutdown for de-facto amnesty .
the president has yet to get any final budget resolution on his desk .
fuck the democrats screwing the country to ask for last-minute de-facto amnesty to be tagged onto a damn budget resolution and refusing to at least pass a continuing resolution to keep federal employees paid .
edit now to be fair the republicans did the same shit in 2013 screwing the country to pull a last minute demand to defund obamacare .
it 's bull shit then the republicans did it and it 's bull shit now when the democrats are doing it .
so where 's the dudes who were preaching btc was going to hit between 7k to 8k usd before going upwards ?

that 's why there is youtube as i did check some other romances as well which i find yukiko the best .
just so you know crypt is n't a lvl 85 area just mausoleum .
yeah i always think the horror genre is the most feminist of all genres since it has by far the largest number of female protagonists and so often has strong women and generally does n't follow most of the sexist tropes you see in other genres .
so it 's not surprising women like it so much .
i love horror movies to the point that i do n't really watch any other genre of movie .
halloween is the best because so many new horror movies come out .
you know there are tons of sub genres of horror maybe you just have n't given it a good chance .
i 'm gon na downvote this and all your comment
ca n't wait for the account to be deleted lol
that said running the thigh-high baroness would n't hurt either .
not many of us know how to do this .
we are so disconnected from ourselves scared of our emotions and we do n't even know it .
we learn all kinds of things in life except emotional and psychological self care and that 's a big problem .
i am so sorry you had to go through that .
and i am sorry your sister in law had no idea how to be there for you .
if it does n't and you are in an accident while doing those jobs it may not be covered .
too often people suggest doing jobs like that but do n't discuss insurance .
when my husband got a pizza delivery job years ago he had to get commercial use coverage that dipped into his earnings quite a bit but it was worth it to be covered .
as a ga if you can set your hours i would see if there is any sort of administrative jobs you could work just off campus where you could work on your research when you are n't answering phones or something similar .
then you could sell your car and have some savings in case any emergencies come up .

sorry but it 's very hard to p2w in this game .
the most you can do is to summon a bunch of high star characters and upgrade your whole team to 6-star .
use jades to buy gold and use that gold to buy a bunch of 6-star souls available in the mall from lv41 onwards .
spend a shitload amount of money trying to max 6-star speed soul set for yamausagi/kamaitachi to guarantee first move in pvp .
honestly other than summon it 's better to just grind .

any suggestions or things i could be doing better here ?
any tips would be greatly appreciated before i start the implementation process .
you wo n't be able to run any windows programs at a reasonable speed on the rpi3 .
not because it 's slow but because it 's a completely different processor architecture rpi is arm pc is x86 .
qemu can emulate some functions of x86 but not enough for a full-speed port .

i have n't seen it is that movie as hot as it sounds ?
yeah i did the flight was noisy but not to bad .
i tell you it feels nice to drive on the correct side of the road again .
tv is not like a regular job where everyone should get the same pay for the same role .
if one person is the star and the bigger draw for a show then they do deserve more money .
is anthony anderson a bigger star than tracee ellis ross ?
he is also the centre of the show as he narrates it and has more scenes such as the workplace ones .
it also does n't say how big the gap in their pay is .
if he 's earning double what she does then that 's pretty bad .
if it 's just a few percent difference then i think that 's probably about right .
that one space is extra special because it has free parking .
i turned 0.01 btc into a full btc but i did with shitcoins on coinexchange .
with bittrex it might take a long time but eventually you get there if you trade with profits only .
my argument is n't that in want everything to be easy but rather actually difficult all they have done is make things longer to kill which is n't difficult it 's just more grundy and for making a normal argument i am insulted .
i 've never used anything like this to meet new people unfamiliar with where i stand so any feedback on pics/profile would be massively appreciated !
sounds like you might be better off with a raspberry pi so you can run linux .

.59 was nothing like cod pubg tents-on-the-coast servers it was basically the same post-apocalyptic survival mmo '' we have now just without the new renderer audio and trees so i 'm not sure why you felt the need to bring all that up ?
i have also never said that dean 's quote or vision was irrelevant i have said that the hicks quotes are more specific and relevant in this context and i do n't see how the context of the quotes themselves changes anything really .
my original reply was intended to put your interpretation of deans vision that the loot levels of .62 may be reduced further '' into perspective .
my point with the mmo was that at least that 's the impression i got from you you do n't play it as an mmo but on your own empty private server .
i do n't want to go through your comment history to find something that i could try and make fit my lecturing '' accusations but instead admit that i went over the top with that .
i just did n't like how you low key made it seem as if op was looking for a cod pubg tents-on-the-coast experience .
it 's true that english is not my first language and your rating of my comprehension skills is a bit depressing .

tthe honest citizens of russia blew their chance at democracy and went right back to soviet light authoritarianism .
if trump were to say nuke northkorea we as americans would be and would be held responsible because we elected him and because once it was entirely completely clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was o unqualified we did n't remove him from office .
equally and for the same reasons the russian people are responsible for this shit that we 're dealing with .
if there was a way to take the country off of all the internet i 'd do it .
if the russiansdn do n't like being off line they can make a governmental change and we could let them back .
one day you will stop seeing women as things for you to put on a pedestal and realize that your misogynistic notions of honor make you a massive fucking dweeb and an asshole and you will cringe .
yeah i hesitated to point this out because i really appreciate you posting this i love the music and the animation but this cartoon came out in 1933 .

yeah it 's a scam ... .. a small group in the chat already get into the coin prior to them announcing it .
they give the go ahead and suckers try to get into their exchange as fast as they can and buy into it .
the guys in first wait for their point to sell and are the first to pull the trigger ... .leaving the majority buying in at a higher price and with the coin actually lower .
sweet move in an unregulated market if your the small group complete horseshit if you are n't .

one thought about the numbers though when written on things that can be viewed in different rotations price tags for example or a scrap of paper with just a few numbers on it it seems like 3,4,8 and 9 could be confused .

as far as i 'm aware the specific technology to achieve confidentiality on bch has not yet been publicised ... if someone else knows better please feel free to correct me .
it might be a combination of op codes with other features .
i believe nchain will be releasing a bunch of patents in the first half of this year which will be open to anyone to use as long as it 's implemented on bch .
also there will be presentations at conferences in march and may this year in hong kong and tokyo where there i 'm hoping that more info on the confidentiality might be released .

with enough bad luck you can experience it without moving .
jaylen brown will never be a top 20 player .
a wing who is as awful as him at dribbling passing and overall decision making will not be on that level .
kyrie irving will never be a top 5 player .
he is the most overrated player in the nba .
that is seriously practical for you though ... you do n't even have to change your last name !

😂 i did n't try cop any yet have n't had the cash gon na try for the lny though .
i think it 's cool that you want to discuss things with this person in order to help them understand you better .
by all means discuss away i do believe that sometimes it 's possible to change people 's minds though it 's not always so depending on the people and circumstances .
however i do n't think that you should date someone who basically considers you mentally ill .
it 'll wreck your self-esteem i 've been there .
if you manage to change their mind all right .
i 'm a psychologist and do not believe bdsm is a mental illness .
i do believe that like any alternative lifestyle it does attract a larger portion of unstable people than a more vanilla '' lifestyle does because a lot of unstable people find it an easier environment to manage their instability .
however in itself it 's really not a mental illness it 's just another culturally influenced way of fulfilling one 's particular needs and proclivities and the dsm agrees .
if it were a mental illness you would n't have kink-friendly therapists because you do n't have schizophrenia or depression-friendly therapists .
tell your guy that his mother 's therapy school is just one of many that most of them have different attitudes towards different things and that her opinion is not the end all be all of the discussion .
also tell him that it 's mostly people with bad mental health that go to therapy so it stands to reason that the bdsm-minded people who go to therapy will also have mental health issues .
if you just apply basic formal logic you 'll see that this does n't mean that all bdsm practitioners are mentally ill you have no premise to conclude that based on therapy experiences alone .
you are perfectly right at your observation this time .
is everyone getting this from pod save america or did i miss something ?

its the only tiler i 've ever tried that even made me consider leaving openbox .
sane config easy to mod impossibly powerful with nested tabs/containers stable and handles multiple monitors easily .
the only reason i stay openbox is because like all tilers i3 is n't exactly a joy using only the mouse .
i have some sessions where i 'm all keyboard and some where i 'm all mouse and openbox rocks at both .
i3 is even better at keyboard but all mouse is painful for me .
i 'm not saying the game is good or bad .
but if your game is n't finished with the features you want and few enough bugs then you have no business allocating enough time to complete an entire expansion .
if they can spam me with mail every other day ... they can inform me my plan is not offered any more .
it is a calculated decision to not tell people .
basically if you see someone over 30 with big boobs that have not sagged and are all perky and shit i 'm 99 sure they 're fake .
is that the notebook where you draw pictures of your dad naked ?
just because you disagree with someone politically it does n't necessarily make them evil and worthy of someone to demonise .
most people have justifiable reasons for their beliefs in my opinion .
these days it 's all to easy to just classify those you do n't agree with as the enemy .
i think this is a good example that being more open and willing to talk to others you disagree with is a good thing .
moviepass is a subscription service it does n't matter how you pay for the subscription it 's still a subscription .

yeah cheese more expensive than that comes from companies that let you know the name s of the moose you get your cheese from gullan haelga or juna .
and i doubt someone just drops a box of cheese like that near where an 18-yo will be working later and hopes for the best .
i feel your pain my experience is very similar .
the change to monolith in my opinion killed he game .
imagine all the time spent on monolith but spent on legacy instead .
oh man we could be in heaven right now .
i do n't know anyone in our racing club who has ever entered 7th on the track .
while it may just be another gear '' to you the reason we prefer it for racing is the better gear selectivity when having to rev match before a tricky turn especially with turbo cars and having to carry speed out of certain turns .
for example in some 5/6 speed cars there are some turns where coming out of the apex in 2nd will cause the tires to slip too much when the boost really kicks in .
trying the same turn in 3rd will be better but wo n't provide you with the acceleration you need in an actual competition .
but with 7 speeds the gear ratio is changed and usually 3rd will work perfectly for that turn and you are n't having to waste time shifting 2nd to 3rd making you lose boost .
this does n't apply as much for na setups than it does for turbo builds though !
just wanted to share my experience in case anyone else had similar issues in certain races .
i 'm under no obligation to speak to a trump supporter any differently then trump would go back to your shit*house you fucking right wing apologist .

this place is going to be a shithole in the next 10 years
so recently i got feeling for by 'bestfriend ' lets call her twinkles .
so there 's 3 other people in this story so let 's give them shitty names so she has another best friend that she 's known for alot longer than me lets call her nappy .
so we also have this friend who i met in english class he 's the one that told twinkles i like her let 's call him shropshire and there 's this other guy a fuckboy that likes her let 's call him twatface .
so a while ago twatface and twinkles started talking this was when i was not sure if i liked her and tired to ignore the feelings as being a hormonal fuck .
so twatface told her that he likes her and that he loves her after meeting her like once so twinkles rejected him .
not long passed and twinkles decided to tell twatface that she loves him i do n't even know why she even thought of saying that .
so i told her i did n't like him and that he is just a typical fuck boy and to find someone better .
so not long after she finds out that i like her and shit gets awkward but recently i told her that i like her and she 's fine with it and said she does n't deserve me aka rejected .
that night she told me she has n't relapsed in 3 months because of me i could n't of been more proud of her .
so yesterday i found out that i quote 'kind of dating ' him .
oh and guess what he cheated on her also guess what she relapsed ohhhh and guess what nappy and shropshire knew about this and no one never decided to tell me .
i asked that if the reason she did n't tell me was because i likes her and i said that i really could not give a shit about my own feelings which is true but nope apparently i do n't understand so i tryed to calm down and ask her why but nope she does n't want to tell me .
biggest part of this that fucks me over is how nappy and shropshire could let her even come close to dating this piece of shit .

been following this subreddit for a while and learnt quite a bit from just searching and reading .
i 've finally started to play around with some prototypes and i 'm at the stage where i 'd like to get some feedback !
this my design for a minimal wallet made from one piece of leather minimal stitching .
i still think i need work on my stitching s perhaps a thinner thread might make it look a little neater .
only with trickster 's patient reaper effect i can stop degen .
i want to stop degen normally so i do n't die doing lab .
i got roft amulet and rings with regen already .
i really do n't know what to do next because i struggle with resist on the rest of my gears .
i need directions this is my first time playing rf .
its battery overheats all the time and it causes the phone to shut down .
also mobile network signal is pretty weak and anyone sends a text message to my phone it takes ages for my phone to receive the message or it does n't at all .
also when my battery overheats i receive a notification that my sd card has been unmounted .
so please i ca n't buy a new phone at the moment i really need your help .
this is a thread for simple or common training questions that do n't merit their own individual threads as well as a place to ask injury related questions .
it also serves as a less intimidating way for new climbers to ask questions without worrying how it comes across .
when i select the traits of syncretic evolution species the strong '' trait is always in red color as if it is not usable for this species .
then when i hover the cursor on the traits tab it says strong requires one of the species archetype ''
i tried selecting different species avatars but nothing worked .
i also tried uninstalling all trait-related mods and reinstalling the game but still did n't work .
i mean in general dc comics tend to refer to characters by their names kal/clark diana barry hal etc .
batman 's really the only hero who 's consistently called batman and even he gets called bruce a lot .
there are currently 6 active earth gls not to mention thousands more out in space so it 's not obvious which character you 're talking about without context .
green lantern '' is n't a codename it 's an occupation .
you could call hal i_a green lantern but calling him green lantern is just ... awkward .
sorry for the mini rant just something that 's been bugging me for a long time .
this is the place for all of those pictures that you 're eager to share with r/snowboarding but that do n't actually depict the act of snowboarding .

disclaimer ii i have played smite on and off throughout the last half decade so yes i can judge it
i think a lot of you people do n't realize how many features paragon has that let smite look like a game from the last century .
i hope you got your eyes on the hp bar 95 of the time because there is no feedback at all .
in paragon you got so much hit feedbacks you can tell instantly if you are in a dire situation or if all skillshots just missed you .
in smite it 's either guessing or always watching your hp bar which is especially dire in 3rd person view if you are getting hit from behind .
your hp is being drained and you simply do n't realize it .
example true 3d yes a lot of people miss the verticality from legacy and i can completely understand it .
but at least we still got a bunch of verticality left .
example physics/feeling you are playing a powerful god in smite throwing around balls of fire conjuring lightning from the sky jumping into the fray blades bared .
well ... that 's how you 'd imagine it at least .
and i was just sitting there like meh '' .
even peashooter twinblast feels more satisfying to watch than all of smite 's abilities .
if you throw a meteor with gideon then you throw a huge freaking meteor !
it was released in 1.0 somewhere around 2014 i believe !
but what you guys tend to forget is it has been 2 or more years in beta at least from 2012 on and boy it has n't felt as polished '' as it might feel now .
yes epic/paragon has a lot of work still ahead but this doom and gloom around a game that is being compared to smite that often recently is just utterly ridiculous because if you really want to compare paragon to smite then compare it to the beta smite and suddenly everything is looking just fine .
especially if you have a game with way more complex assets/high poly graphics/etc that just needs a lot more time to work on .
i have two instruments with a similar range and pickups and i want to try using one pedal .
i have a viola to which i have fitted a generic piezo disc pickup .
i also have a mandolin which had a magnetic pickup which i have disassembled and replaced with a piezo disc .
i find the mandolin 's tone much more natural now if a bit shrill but that 's to be expected .
i have also put together a small 2-in-1-out converter to which i can connect both instruments in parallel to the input of the zoom g1xon .
i will later add a switch or a pan-pot so i can properly switch between instruments
the idea is i would set up separate patches for each instrument in the g1xon and simply switch the patch as i switch instruments .
1 has anyone used a violin or viola with the zoom g1xon pedal ?
2 has anyone ever connected more than one instrument in parallel to any pedal ?
i 've been using the diet calculator and it says that it gives 5 advs .
in the wiki it says it gives 4.5 advs per unused drunkenness if the effect straight-edgy is still active during rollover but the diet calculator says does n't leave any drunkenness left for this effect to work .
does it still give adventures if the effect is active during rollover and if i have filled my 19 drunkenness ?
here is my attempt at creating a character who has achieved mastery over it .
rakish audacity gained as a 3rd level swashbuckler and tactical wit gained as a 2nd level war wizard allow the player to add their charisma and intelligence modifiers respectively to their initiative roll .
jack of all trades gained as a 2nd level bard gives half proficiency bonus rounded down to any ability check that does n't already include proficiency bonus .
similarly remarkable athlete gained as a 7th level champion gives half prof. rounded up to any str dex or con ability check that does n't already include prof. bonus .
it is questionable if these two features stack but lets not split hairs .
stacking this all together would give you a 24 to your initiative at level 20 !
5 from dex 5 from alert 4 from cha with rakish audacity 4 from int with tactical wit 3 from joat and 3 from remarkable athlete
now almost nothing can beat your initiative and all will tremble before or rather after you !
what can you do with all this initiative you ask ?
you always get a round of combat likely no more then one with you 8 constitution but with alert giving you immunity to surprise your initiative will always shine !
you can burn out quickly like the brilliant flame you are !
due to your high initiative when you fall unconscious you will have your death saving throws long before anyone else can try to save you !
thanks to your high initiative you 'll always be the first of the block when the gun fires !
and with 30 base movement and 10 movement from the spell longstrider you can feline agility to double movement for a turn making 40 base move into 80 then use your action to dash for 80 your bonus action to dash for 80 and action surge to dash for 80 .
totaling at 320 feet of movement just shy of the 328 required to finish the race .
putting all this together turn and run at the first sign of combat faster then even the fastest dragon .
become immortal by virtue of your cowardly tactics and fast reactions !
you could also probably grapple things with expertise in athletics despite your 8 str but that would be bordering on useful and this build is n't about that .
live life in the fast lane with a high initiative after all if some initiative as good all the initiative should be amazing !
i will also point out that by getting 2 more levels into bard and wizard rather then 4 in fighter at later levels would allow for 1 more asi which could give a total initiative of 25
edit in light of joat not stacking with remarkable athlete 2 more levels in fighter rather then bard to get 1 more asi giving a total initiative of 22

zidane took to the media room at real madrid city on the eve of the team 's fixture against deportivo and the whites ' coach had the following to say about the first game of the second half of the campaign deportivo do n't deserve to be where they are in the table .
we 'll have to be fully focused look to make the best possible start and play with real intensity .
they do n't deserve to be where they are and it 'll be a tough game '' .
we have to keep doing the things we 're doing well and improve on those areas where we 're not performing .
we know that we 're at home and our plan is always the same to play our game create chances and get close to their box to score goals .
we 'll be going all out in each of our games between now and the end of the season '' .
i 'm not bothered about that and it 's not something i think about .
we 're a tight-knit group and the solution lies within .
we need to go out and show just who we are and we 've got an opportunity to do that tomorrow '' .
i 'll be fighting as i always do because that 's what i 've been taught to do .
i 'll never give in which is just what this club 's values are all about '' .
he should be due to return to training with the group next week .
that 's the plan and we 'll take it day by day .
he was out on the grass this morning and his recovery is going well '' .
the three of them will be in the squad but i 'm not going to say who 'll play .
it 's a positive to have players with the quality that they have and it 's good to welcome injured players back .
i 'm very happy to have these three brilliant players in my squad .
it 's important that they 're back and available .
they 're a real threat in attacking areas and can offer the team a great deal '' .
he 's really raring to be back out there to be with his teammates and offer the team what he does best .
he just has to play football and he 's keen to show what he can do .
we 're unable to control the criticism and the messages about him '' .
there will never be any issues between the club and myself .
we always do things together and if we 're discussing something it 's always with the club .
he 's happy and is pleased to be here .
the most important thing in this is my player and i 'm not going to give my opinion about what others say .
i 've spoken to him and he 's told me many times that he 's happy .
he must be focused on what he 's doing and concentre on being here .
he 's the present and the future of real madrid despite not playing much '' .
i ca n't see that anyone is looking down .
they 're all very hard-working and i 'm lucky enough to be working with them '' .
i do n't speak about players that are n't mine .
feel free to discuss possible line-ups tactics and anything related to the upcoming game .
i put together a system that was an enermax case bundled with an enermax revolution duo 600w psu dual fan psu .
within 3 months the rear fan which has a manual speed control started exhibiting behavior where it would start making noises after running for a few hours .
it 's finally getting worse so i 'm guessing the bearings in it are going bad .
i know i can rma it but figure for the time i 'll be without one it may be easier to just try and replace it .
any recommendations on what type of fan i may need to look for as a replacement since this one includes a manual speed control ?
i know opening the psu will void the warranty so trying to gauge level of effort versus just getting an rma .
look on your face when you pack an 80 rated player-priceless

i 'm in a very fortunate situation a lot of people do n't get to experience .
yet i find myself growing more and more depressed than i 've ever been .
and knowing how blessed i am makes me mad at myself for being depressed .
and on top of that everyone is getting married .
how do people just wind up finding someone to love ?
i 'm honestly so scared that i will be alone forever and just be here by myself day after day .
i do n't even know if this belongs here but i just needed to speak my mind for a moment .

i 've spent hours looking for projects a programming beginner currently a university freshman with one class of experience can easily do but literally everything i 've tried has been too hard for me .
a basic rpg game card games battleship etc all seem extremely basic but i 'm simply not capable of even knowing where to start with them .
the intro to programming class i took was extremely easy and the hardest assignment was creating an atm deposit/withdrawal system without the use of objects .
i read a textbook in my own time to further my knowledge but i have absolutely zero clue on how i 'm supposed to use my knowledge of what feels like arrays basic objects and for loops to create anything of actual value .
i 've spent hours looking for threads trying to find what to do but every single one has comments saying solve a problem you have '' or make a basic project '' but how am i supposed to do that considering i have absolutely no idea on how to actually do that ?
how am i supposed to know how objects interact with constructors of other objects if the extent of my knowledge only goes to looping through a 2d array to find a certain index ?
this is just ridiculously frustrating considering i ca n't even begin to understand how to use my knowledge to create anything.

so how will they make money if they 're not selling a new os every three years ?
the ‘as a service ' implies an ongoing payment .

do you think they really will stick to this being their final os ?

ballons in peoples ears kids dabbing and a jeff kaplan head that was coming in and out of screen .
the air in the inn room was stale and hung empty and lifeless .
it provided no warmth or chill to its inhabitants .
old and worn wood floors pounded flat by decades of traffic were only slightly more comfortable in their pulpy state than a wood floor should be .
the moonlight cascading in through the window highlighted every bump .
diath lay awake on his side on the floor too awake to sleep immediately though his body begged for it .
the run down inn only had one-bed rooms and only two rooms remaining .
diath 's eyes floated up to strix whose back was to him .
the pair often shared their rooms in these situations .
strix found she slept better with diath close by and diath preferred being able to keep watch on her .
no argument came from evelyn 'forced ' to share a room with her favorite bard who was usually too tired or inebriated at this point to contest .
a smile found its way to diath 's lips as he watched the tiefling 's slumber .
however as strix turned in her cot and her feet found the floor the smile faded .
strix closes her eyes shut tight and shakes her head .
strix 's stammered words and clear discomfort brought diath up to a seated position .
diath asked suddenly feeling the oddness of the room himself .
it felt as though he should know what was going on like the strange aura was somehow something he knew but with how tired he was he could n't place it .
i was thinking about barovia about being alone . ''
strix 's head turned down to the floor and her voice was so soft diath almost did n't register it .
the twinge of regret and sadness at the mere mention of barovia was amplified to a constant dull throb with the knowledge that it still plagued strix .
hey it 's ok. '' diath rose to his feet and strode across to the cot where strix sat hunched her hands twisting and fidgeting in her lap .
she shuffled to the side to give him room to sit down but something compelled diath to forgo the extra space and instead huddle in close to strix their hips right against each other 's .
he gingerly placed a hand onto her knee and strix turned to look at him .
diath asked compassion painted his face softening it 's scars and radiating comfort as though strix was surrounded on all sides by waffles ' downy softness .
strix 's hands twitched nervously her pinky rising and reaching weakly toward diath 's resting hand almost subconsciously .
something inside her wanted contact a connection to something real to ground her in reality .
it was a rare feeling for her and she often ignored it but something this time urged the rest of her hand forward .
fingers clasped around diath 's hand clumsily as if the motion was entirely foreign .
his eyes stayed focused on the person in front of him as her face flexed and she bit her lip slightly her eyes narrowing on her hand trying to get the gesture right .
this is weird i ... do n't do this . ''
she said again so softly that diath had trouble committing the words to the moment .
he may have failed to catch her meaning had strix not ever so slightly tightened her grip on his hand in emphasis .
the ones i gave you all and they were supposed to ... make me feel better about losing you all i guess .
strix 's launch into her words cemented diath in the moment for the first time .
i couldn't '' strix 's words caught in her throat .
something in her head told her not to say what she was saying there were still layers of uncertainty she had n't worked through .
diath twisted his palm upward without thinking and held strix 's hand as he stared on at her .
when i finally finished it it still felt wrong .
it was n't you no matter how hard i tried to make it be you .
and you were n't there and that hurt too . ''
moonlight caught the sadness that welled in the corners of strix 's eyes and caught slightly on the trail it left down her cheek .
the words strix found came slow as if each one was a heavy weight requiring all her strength to lift off .
her head turns to him little by little fighting to face him .
but but when you held me after you came back ... you felt real . ''
needing no more prompting diath 's arms quickly rose around strix 's shoulders and he pulled her close to him .
strix buries her head in the crook of diath 's shoulder and sniffles loudly .
diath allows himself to briefly enjoy holding the witch guilty for feeling any pleasure from her trauma he begins to form a sentence of comfort .
before he can however strix rises from his chest and looks him in the eye her face so close to his he begins feeling warm .
i do n't want to doubt that you 're real .
i do n't want to doubt that you 're alive and that this is really happening ...
i do n't want there to be any doubts ... ''
strix 's head comes closer too quickly and her nose crashes against diath 's .
the impact is followed quickly by her dry cracked lips pressing into his .
diath barely has time to feel the pain blooming across his nose .
diath finds that it 's his turn now to doubt his reality .
the same uncertainty she felt while crafting the doll boiled inside her .
she wanted to know that diath was real she wanted to ground herself in something .
grounding herself in the comfort that diath 's compassionate face had offered her moments ago felt as clear an option as any .
i do n't know what i was thinking ! ''
her heartstrings twanged like a plucked instrument as she wrenches herself backward .
taken aback at the broken contact diath 's eyes fluttered open with confusion .
i uhhh it it 's ok strix you do n't need to apologize .
diath 's heart felt so light it threatened to float right out of his body .
strix had already flopped herself down to the heavily trodden floor .
mphh ffmmm dunnhhh '' diath heard strix muffled mumbling from the ground .
he gets up from the bed and sits on the ground next to her .
strix i mean it it 's ok. '' he said laying his hand down onto her back .
she turned her head to the side to face him tears had stopped flowing from her puffy eyes now .
you ... probably wanted to just do something that would illicit some harsh reaction .
strix stared blankly into space seemingly mulling over diath 's words .
she finally said breaking the silence that diath allowed to persist so that he too could ponder what happened .
diath was going to get up and return to his previous position but he reconsidered .
if strix was feeling that way she may feel better to have someone close by so rather than get up he just laid down next to strix and closed his eyes .
eventually diath heard strix 's breathing slow and become calm .
i hope this did n't come out terrible because i was rushing or anything .
the dix trash conglomerate did a sad last night so i 'm counteracting it with some smooching .
i will probably do a followup as i do n't feel we 've been completely absolved of our sins .
getting a new mouse since my old ouroboros is dying on me .
was thinking of the two mice in the title .
i usually play fps like cs go and overwatch but i 'm also getting into rpgs like divinity along with league .
i like the swappable side-plates on the naga but the lancehead is more fps based .
the sensors are the same but the naga is a bit heavier and coming from the ouroboros at 135g i worry the lancehead is going to be light 107g .
if anyone could give some insight to these two mice that would be nice thanks !
i am going to play grixis midrange or mardu vehicles the rest of the season most likely since i already have the cards
i was previously on temur energy and i own about 10 botanical sanctum .
from draft mostly only pre-order a playset for use .
i also have all the green cards from temur energy that may not get played .
should i buylist them all or is the money just insignificant and i should keep them for frontier or some kind of future use ?
most of the cycle is around 4 is this just a long term hold ?
what did you guys do after the bans and why ?
regardless if i press the optimize button or if i press on setup later '' i ca n't get past it .
also just so we 're all on the same page i do mean streamlabs obs and not just obs .
so i dropped my honor 6x which resulted in some small cracks in the corner as well as the entire screen turning into rainbow stripes .
i 'm trying to mirror the screen onto my laptop or tv but prior to the screen breaking i did n't have usb debugging turned on if that 's even a thing on huaiwei phones .
is there some alternative way that i can access my broken phone or use commands to turn on usb debugging ?
the touch controls are completely fine by the way .
is there anything resembling a theory or metric for ranking all species including humans from least to most intelligent in absolute terms ?
i see that there is raw brain size https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brain_size and the encephalization quotient https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encephalization_quotient .
but the above metrics do n't explain why an elephant or whale is bigger yet still considered '' less intelligent .
perhaps it would help if i explain why i am asking such a question .
i want to know what intelligence level would be required to outsmart humans in the same way humans outsmart and domesticate less intelligent creatures .
for example if an invasive foreign cosmological civilization invaded us what intelligence level would they need to be at ?
are there any books that write on this subject ?
long pressing the thumbnail to see the image or text post should mark ot as seen .
i love the idea of filtering out seen posts but my problem is that it only counts as seen of you either fully open the post or long press the title things that i rarely do .
i usually just long press the thumbnail to see the image or text posts so i ca n't fully take advantage of the feature unless i take the extra effort to long press the title .
i know it 's not that big of an ordeal but i find it annoying .
other than that i am loving the app i am new to it .
so excuse me if there already is a way to do this or have plans to implement it .
i feel like this anime/manga beg to have its own story where light is actually rational .
specifically when your opponent is already at the net .
i want to get better at charging the net after hitting a good drive and then follow up with an attacking volley .
im listening to lil peep because his songs are good but there so depressing
my wife and i have been reading through old emails from my mother to me some from more than a decade ago when i was first starting university .
i always knew she was annoying and had a tendency to nag but i saw it as run-of-the-mill overbearing mother stuff .
seeing those emails with what i 've learned in the past year or so puts things in a whole new light .
emailing multiple times a day about mundane tasks going through my bank statements to see what i 've been buying a personal account constant lecturing and intervention about marks and social life reminding about birthdays and offering gifts for me to give to people so i would n't have to shop etc ...
i can now see the harm she did to me by raising me like this .
not treating me as if i 'm an individual human being just trying to insert herself into my life as much as possible .
so much of her behaviour that we thought began with our engagement has always been there .
manipulating me into breaking plans with friends to do something with her instead for example .
i could even see my responses change throughout time .
my incredulity at how she said my father was behaving at the beginning of their separation gave way to acceptance after awhile i 've now realized that a lot of this was just flat-out lying on her part .
the most insane one we read came after i learned that i got a job i had applied for when i was in my mid-twenties it is like a goddamn cartoon caricature of a narcissist mother .
i woke up this morning and was truly happy .
you are an extension of me so when something happens to you it is as if it happens to me .
i have all kinds of new stuff to talk to my therapist about now .
hello so i found this reddit a few hours ago where almost every post is about frostfang or evelynns viability .
i 've played eve for quite some time and had 90 win rate on my fresh account in preseason where i got to d5 in 30 games with evelynn .
the reason why you think her early game is very weak its because you do n't abuse her powers correctly this is probably because you rush your frostfang or rush your blue/red smite .
i can tell you that she is weak if you build for late game frostfang is n't early game related at all blue smite is not that important early either .
what i did all my games as eve is to get around 1050 gold 1400 if getting fb a kill but you cant get one every time by then you will be level 5 .
if i got a kill i would go hextect revolver dark seal because i am confident that i will snowball .
you can dive anyone you want so there is really no excuse to not snowball early game as eve if you build her the right way .
the most important thing with evelynn is how you position yourself if you know where the enemy jungler is you win .
i know this got a bit messy since i normally do not write posts so i am sorry if you have any questions about evelynn i can try to answer them .
it got cool abilities and it 's normal type for the normal gym we 're longing for !
this creature was created by humans in order to fight against ultra beasts which features prime number stats .
it has 0mp due to being cryogenically frozen but will lash out once it senses it 's target .
clvl does take into account a clvled beast may get away with the radar but other pokémon may also be taken as threat if they clvl into prime numbers e.g .
31 hyper sonic mew is very common now it ca n't save itself if type null hits more than 100
punishment is such a cool attack check it out !
you can also edit your own deck with prime numbers on purpose to lure this abomination out !
granting it semi-movement pursuing your own prime numbers thus clvl10 is not always the best decision in this sense .
rks still in development so we 'll take silverlly on hold for now and see how the others ultra beasts roll .
1. you can activate beast killer on the bench or field but not from p.c .
beast killers ' you mush then attack if possible '' clause is referring to it 's berserk instinct but you ca n't attack if there 's no adjacent opposing pokémon after relocating .
for example if your type null faces your opponents clvl1 type null their punishment 's boosting effect will be negated as 61 is a prime number .
actually i think all damage modifications happens during battle except for evolve/gym boosts correct me if i 'm wrong .
i have had this account for awhile and i do not want it anymore .
i am posting here because i do n't want to pay to sell it on another site .
recently my games have been filled with trolls feeders and you guessed it afk 's .
i watch streamers play and they never have the same teammates that seem like they 're trying to ruin your games in the way i have been experiencing .
so that being said what kind of mentality does one have to be in to climb and carry these people who do not want to win and why does this seem to happen so so very often ?
hey all you super moonrise attendees here is your very early reminder from your local ems provider not to lie to us about your indulgements or extra curricular activities .

seattleite here i am now living in the city and i am looking for a san francisco equivalent to the alternative weekly news publication i grew up reading in seattle known as the stranger www.thestranger.com .
it generally has current events city level political news and a surprisingly comprehensive list of all the activities going on in the city during any given week including who is headlining at almost every venue in the city that night .
i really miss having this resource for the place i live in .
this is n't really for me rather it 's for my wife .
she used to stream 2ish years ago and wants to get back in now that she has more free time .
she used to use obs and something called stream pro ?
i think we have them all still installed but wanted to know what 's changed in the past few years in regards to the tools and software used in streaming .
she upgraded from a ati 7700 to a gtx 960 so are there new settings encodings i should use ?
what else is new and popular in the twitch world ?
edit answered but i do n't care much anymore because my wife decided that she was going to go to bed 3 hours early after i spent all this time upgrading her computer updating applications and windows and completely moving her entire desk into a better streaming environment '' so we could spend a few hours with my parents watching my son .
and now she 's yelling at me because i did n't wake her up .
just a quick question about which i should major in considering 1 .
i do n't care about career prospects too much double degree eng paired with arts for personal interest and i 'm passionate about both subjects .
i 'm conflicted so if you could offer any insights into which subject is better at usyd it 'd be great !
if cryptokitties can clog up the ethereum blockchain would n't bat aiming to handle the ad transaction volumes of thousands/second have the same issue ?

i am the only user on the computer and i am listed as administrator under users .
however when i try to open the program it gives me the message

since i 've been homeschooled growing up i had no need for my own phone but now that i 'm almost out of highschool and just got my first part time job i 'm hopefully going to finally get one for myself .
firstly i know nothing about phones or the terms you use with them .
i do n't exactly know what a good price is for a phone but i 'd assume about 150 is my limit .
i do n't have any preferred brands because as i said i 'm new to all this .
if someone could explain the difference between unlocked phones and carriers i still do n't get it i would really appreciate it .
i do n't plan on gaming on it or anything .
i really just have budget but pretty good quality in mind .
it 's glitch and just show up as a big grey square .
it 's not just me played with random in squad and they usually complain about it as well .

so this week i 20m think i got rejected three times
i asked a friend out and she said no very nicely though haha .
my manager at work chose not to give me additional responsibilities .
some girl hit on me in a bar i think ?
we were both smashed and i got her number but next day she does n't reply to my text .
any one of these on their own is fine but all three in a week is getting to me .
i feel like i 'm not worth much to anyone .
i 'm usually the type to be able to move on quick from getting rejected but i feel like i ca n't do well in my social life or even at work ?
i should n't even be this upset it 's not like any one of those three things is a big deal really .
question should schools allocate more time under contract for teachers to complete their most basic of duties or is it okay necessary to expect teachers to work x extra hours unpaid every day simply to break even '' on daily requirements of the job ?
crunching my own personal contractual numbers is it reasonable to expect a person to prepare for 30 hours of presentation/teaching material split across three unique subjects when only given 5 hours that is also split between grading mandatory meetings and mandatory parental contacts in a single average week ?
looking at it from a logical and economic perspective i just feel it is illogical to pay a person for 8 hours of work then punish '' them for failure of completion when only given 1/6 '' of the time necessarily to do it properly unless they decide to essentially work for free out of their own pocket while not on contracted time .
i do know it gets easier over many years also i am not anywhere near struggling but i decided to run the exact numbers and it just baffles me that 30 of my week roughly 4 hours per day/16 per weekend is not directly spent on basic biological functions sleeping eating traveling and cleaning yourself or spent working contractually speaking yet only 24 of the average week 's time is covered under paid duty hours yielding nearly 40 of my week spent working essentially for free just to make sure i am ready for the next day/not behind .
i do not mean to make this a rant or complaint but rather a serious question as more and more expectations are being passed down year to year with seemingly less and less time to achieve them .
i just feel that if another job required you to work 20 hours to receive 10 hours worth of pay then that business would go under due to having no employees yet this in my experience colleagues experience is how the entire educational system is run .
i apologize if this complaint '' has been brought up numerous times i just feel that the expectations are at best institutional exploitation of good willed people .
i personally could quit any day and retire financially secured but i do love what i do so i do not mind so much but just thinking about the reality of the situation makes me feel so uncomfortable .
i do not want to equate it to slavery-esque expectations but truly it seems like that .
you can still put missiles and torpedoes on an alpha class star wing with xg-1 assault configuration .
it adds to cannons it does n't take it away
it 's easy to stop feeling lonely when you have just one good friend who 's around a lot and easy to talk to .
you are n't lonely when you spend most nights casually talking to someone right ?
and maybe it 's fine you do n't notice you do n't need them all that much .
but if it 's a night when you were really hoping to have someone around ?
what a reminder that you 're far far lonelier than you thought .
all i wanted to do today was play arms with someone .
it 's an event weekend so what better time right ?
but my friend was busy which is fine that 's not their fault but it left me all alone with no one to play with .
i could play on my own but then i do n't have that fun talk on the side .
i might as well just play offline against cpus .
i might as well just not play at all .
and it 's not my friend 's fault i ca n't expect them to always be around after all .
this would n't happen if i had more than one friend .
if i could find other people to get close to .
so every once in a while when my friend is busy and i need someone around i 'm going to go through another night just like this .
i now have at least 14000000 experience points in the dungeoneering skill .
now go bang your ex and get on tinder tomorrow .
do n't do it again bro seriously if you feel that the spirit is demonic or negative do not intentionally summon it do n't mess with it just leave it alone and avoid it that shit will be dangerous to you or your fortune
please be safe i 'm serious and tell your friend to light some sage around his house demons are nothing to mess with
he will literally pick off anything within 15 yards of him with that great speed .
i have been run over multiple times by bo jackson and marshawn lynch though today .
just so you know this vid was really helpful to me as a noob trying to get the hang of the charge blade i beat nerg in a group earlier and trying to down him solo now how many trys did it take you lol it can be pretty rage inducing haha .
i think i can get him down before the beta ends
personally i think mei and yuzu will work things out with the grandfather without hiding it and if not mei will let yuzu go so that yuzu can find someone that loves her as strongly as she loves them with no constraints attached
i was hoping the marchers might clarify but it looks like just another trump-bashing rally .
in addition to that they will only spawn where they player has traveled before
very sloppy possessions and passing from both teams this game
i could probably watch the review on mute and still think something sketchy was happening .
humans dont make micro adjustments so fast and precise they have to literally be slowed to 10 or 20 percent speed to see .
but im done argueing about this some people will always be naive enough to believe its impossible to cheat on lan when thats clearly a fallacy .
yeah i 've heard him say it a few times but most notably on the guy ritchie episode .
i 'm not sure why we play so poorly on control .
also sf is so much better with dhak on mercy and sleepy on mercy instead of dhak on mercy and sleepy on zen .
i would have rather kept neko on zen but i 'm confident the coaching staff will figure it out .
i know we lost in the end but i feel like we crushed them in the wins and were competitive in the losses .
just not our day we will get there though it 's a long season .
i forgot about i always ended up chromecasting to my nexus player because that app was so annoying the live streaming part was n't terrible but the search did n't work at all

last time they made a stupid change and called it a bug bounce back to the top of the mon list it resulted in people spending money to extend their storage to get by until the bug was fixed .
i do n't see how this can result in making them any more money though unless it 's a way to promote the go somehow .
i read that as origins lol i wan na going to say on my x i still get a minute of loading when i die

biggest downside of owning a prebuilt is that the manufacturer tends to cheap out on components that does n't affect performance on paper .
so the case would feel cheaper and harder to work on the psu would be lower quality with less clean power the hdd would be sluggish the mobo would be built with lower quality parts and less features fans are cheaper gpu cooler would be wimpy etc .
now how cheap depends on the make and model .
an hp envy that i used to have has a really powerful cpu but the cooler ca n't cool the cpu properly and the mobo lowers the standards for low quality .
psu is sketchy with amazingly thin gauge wiring that rivals chinessium quality psus .
my alienware is surprisingly built with higher quality components that rivals budget pc custom builds .
however the case is heavy cramped inside poor airflow for aircooled setups and somehow echos .
the fan controller wo n't speed up the fans and would let the cpu overheat .
mobo features are on par with budget overclocker 's mobos .
only reason why i have the alienware is because i got it for dirt cheap with multiple components missing .
bloatware is n't an issue recently since it 's easy now to reset the os and nuke the junk .

i just stated that having a smaller prize thats easier to get aka idle progression is better than having a large prize you work towards and nothing else when the prizes are the same .
i 'll try my best to explain my current 'problem'..
when i started terraria without looking up much information before i expected some exploring building.. a nice little world to do whatever i wanted with no stress.. something like stardew valley maybe .
i spent hours exploring my first world and i loved it.. but corruption now spreading so fast and destroying everything getting killed by pirates goblins and spawning mechanical bosses almost every night this is what currently ruins my experience/fun .
i feel so stressed by the corruption and i 'm afraid there will be nothing left of my world when i 'm finally skilled enough to kill the bosses on my own .
i did n't have any experience with gameplay-elements like this before.. guess i 'll need more time to get used to it .
i 've already started a new bigger world i 'm planning to prepare waaaay better before getting into hardmode take more time and so on .
i definitly want to be able to kill all the bosses on my own but not under this time pressure
thank you for your wiki/tutorial suggestions i have n't actually watched any tutorials .
maybe looking at some videos might give me more clues about what i 'm doing so wrong right now .
yeh i do n't think this is a nice guy just a guy making a joke which is pretty funny tbh
i got enough of that at my own place thanks .
they are still around the 200 range on here from what i 've seen .
honestly he could purchase one on ebay for that price .
my copy of animal crossing ww and pokemon black .
i only brought three ds games the two above and a littlest pet shop game for the plane flight .
the lps game was not among my favorites but i figured if i got bored of the others i could play it .
so after growing tired of animal crossing and pokemon i played the lps game .
when the plane landed i put my ds in my backpack but left the little ds carrier with the games in the seat holder .
my parents hadnt been sitting next to me on the flight so they wouldnt have been there to remind me when i finally realized what happened we had already left the airport .
we rried calling customer services and stuff like that but they never found it .

i am sure most universities in japan teach english as an elective .
also sure most college degrees in japan require you to pick a foreign language like most in us do .

it 's definitely some sort of disassociative state i 've experienced that exactly myself .
i did n't even slightly claim that i could n't possibly be influenced .
i claimed that it 's ridiculous to accuse dnc/clinton critics of just parroting fake russian propaganda .
i have a binned delidded version purchased it that way and i run it at only 4.7 ghz on all cores at 1.25v .
no game is cpu bound for me anyway and 4 faster encoding times or something like that is pretty much completely unnoticeable .
85 c blue screens or loud fans however are very noticeable .
radicals like the black panthers were an integral part of the civil rights movement for example .
that said the cth leftists are well aware of the negative connotations of the radicalize term and definitely get off on using it to describe themselves .

i 've done a lot of pizza deliveries like 10 's of thousands i have people every single busy day make things up inside their brains and present them as pure facts about our company .
no the internet estimation does not get you a free pizza if we go over it .
no your pizza taking an hour to get there has nothing to do with the temperature or quality of the food you received .
the most recent crazy story is someone ordering on christmas day receiving a pizza made from the general manager who has been making pizzas roughly 40 years .
they called up and said the toppings were stacked in the wrong order on the pizza note not that it was missing toppings or did n't distribute them .
the gm said well that 's how we 've always done them told them we could send them another but it will be the same and then did just that .
when the driver got back we had received a photo copy of their pins from our company from 5 years ago written all over with blue pen telling us the proper order of ingredients one at a time .
separate from that he wrote in pencil in between all of the pen lines really tiny messages of how his pins meant he was n't being rude and that his perfect gm made pizza would be thrown away by a company inspection and we knew it .
the tiny messages pencilled in were all about how his pins mean he is in the know .
before they changed the packaging it was somewhere around 250-260 i believe .
i used to take my own dressing because the dressing was such a high portion of the calories .
i 'm not sure if they 've changed much about the salad since the packaging changed but i hope this gives you a little help !
he got you your first ring in franchise history .

i understand that but i think we 're discussing two different things .
do other countries speak poorly of us and each other ?
but how many of those countries have their leaders on record or at least have heavy accusations levied saying other countries are shitholes ?
also a lot of the problems with us losing prestige on the world stage comes from africa south america and other countries that are on the precipice of becoming truly modernized .
they may seem like inconsequential actors now but in the future they 'll at least have raw materials and a labor force which can be put to use .
would you rather those countries see us as a bunch of stuck up dicks who think they 're shitholes ?
if we wo n't be cordial on the world stage someone else will be .
unless you do n't have any other option making enemies is a terrible idea .

it might make sense for things like that to make loyal pops whether defined by high happiness their faction or their ethic reduce unrest to symbolizes significant portions of the population going out of their way to support the empire and show their loyalty to ensure that their planet does n't get blasted .
it could also reduce the happiness threshold under which unrest happens to represent the fear of epic-scale retaliation but drastically increase the unrest of sufficiently unhappy free pops to represent the 'all-or-nothing ' situation they are being forced into .

oh well less salt for when the winner is crowned .
the issue is some of these weapons you have posted trade for higher tier weapons for example the mp-153 .
4 of them trade for an m4 from pk at level 3 i believe .
so if they were to become cheaper almost halved in price you will literally see m4s every raid .
but i promise there will be value changes throughout beta .
so let 's avoid injuries and give them the win .
i just went out for a bike ride texted them and went home .
ok if the spring ever does wear it fuck a 4 spring .
if you ever need them in any sort of situation or if shtf you are fucked .
every gun i own is loaded and is in some sort of ready-to-fire configuration .
that also depends on what you mean by downtown .
the rates usually go up 10-15 a quarter and have been for a while now so it might be closer to 1500 for that 1br .
he may have a lot to be proud of but speak8ng english is not one of them .
old tv show only 14 episodes but bloody hilarious .
to be fair though it looks pretty good on him 😅
ca n't find anything saying that they closed the case
thank you for your submission but unfortunately it has been removed .
one of the rules here is that submission titles need to objectively describe what 's visible in the photograph .

he 's had plenty of opportunity but he decided to just throw the ball away
emma never appeared through the portal that regina and original hook came through .
and that that emma we saw that appeared late might not be who you think she is .
most likely that is really gothel in disguise because of what we might see in ep 11 .
and because regina and original hook hinted and discussed about what really happened '' after hook lied to henry .
it was very unrelated to this so called pregnancy .
and also adam already spoiled we will earn real information on emma 's real absence .
logically you should look at things by circumstances rather than location .
if you 're a rich guy with seemingly lots of enemies the wise decision is to have some security .
better safe than sorry and sorry for this guy in this case .
a small deck box of mtg cards that had my sideboard and a few extras '' i had stuffed in it that someone was interested in buying from me back in 1998 or so
yeah thats about 20 grand in cards nowaday i believe ...
i left it on a table at a restaurant and it was probably just tossed in the trash .
always tough to adapt a book to a movie .
especially with a big cult following that spans different generations too .
i feel like that would get old after a while .
especially with how long some of the names of cities can get up north .
he mostly likes to just sit in it though i think he 's still so stunned by it all
traction control works by comparing wheel speeds at the hub .
it matters not the diameter of the tire only that they all maintain the same ratio .
miata comes 1:1 front to rear so you need to maintain that or the car thinks things are out of control .
read the owners manual i 'm sure it says something about this and possibly even has a disable procedure for driving on the spare donut ...
oh i have a 5930k ... uh ... just braggin ' .
someone who had the cd and uploaded the rips to skrillexmothership forum said the disc was just encoded with 160kbs mp3s so ripping flac did n't increase the quality
talking about fitness there is no training that improves fitness ?
i mean about the season itself not specifically in a game .
something that could help some players to restore it 's power better in the season sequence .
chips does n't change the fact that each point of atk is worth 1/3 of a point of hp .
so the march happened because women do n't have penises ?
i guess that makes sense nothing to get caught between the legs whilst marching .
this question is for those who feel that they should be able to bring their emotional support cat or dog with them .
what about people who do n't want to deal with your emotional support turkey http www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/01/15/turkey-delta-airlines-emotional-support-animal_n_8995458.html emotional support pig http www.cnn.com/2014/11/30/travel/emotional-support-pig-booted-flight/index.html emotional support lizard http www.reptilesmagazine.com/reptiles-as-therapy-pets emotional support llama/alpaca https www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/llamas-and-alpacas-put-an-adorable-new-spin-on-the-therapy-animal_us_568d9268e4b0c8beacf591a6 or other emotional support animals https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=qpatxvnxjli .
hmm to add to this maybe make it so those things only happen at night or something ?
otherwise might cause a lot of players to avoid the water ?
or maybe make them rarer then dolphins and stuff ?
the design is called perri so i 've been able to find them online with some variation of sam edelman perri loafer/slip-on/slipper
looks like you can get them here http www.solematesinc.com/product/sam-edelman-perri-slip-on and here .
you can also try poshmark and mercari to see if anyone in selling them used .
i 'll use him as a quick scorer off the bench
acquiring mayfield will at least make the season worth watching .
even if he does n't start i 'd love to see real competition at qb rather than just gifting the job to tannehill .
i 've only read vol 1 2 of supergirl rebirth and i much preferred 1 than 2 .
2 felt a little rushed but 1 was really cool imo .
ffs mods you remove the game thread that 's linked to in the subreddit header ?
did n't see that coming but gohan did good and i 'm happy with it .
kinda disapointed with golden frieza transformation 's reused animation and the you may not have noticed this the reused animation of u11 god who made the same face as when talking about kaseral .
but the fight choreography was great and frieza 's character is still one of the best in the top .
could have been a 9.5/10 if they increased that budget so that the animation and artwork were as smooth and fluid as vegito vs zamasu but at least last week did have amazing art .
they seem to be only using good artwork for goku 's battles only .
goku vs jiren goku vs kefla and goku and vegeta vs jiren are prime examples of this .
at least it 's not dragon ball goku time aka gt and gohan and frieza had this great battle with dyspo to begin with .
so you don't believe the president is to blame since you used his quote sarcastically ?
hi i 'm not so great at reddit could you help me understand ?
is it in my signature or do you mean my entry about amazon pantry ?
i feel disgusting saying this but i feel like trump has probably gotten enough gold-digger pussy to at least be sort of competent .
ca n't just say how many wins you have ?
can pk dagger cancel the second half of her zone ?
i swear to god i 've seen it happen so many times on console but a buddy i had test it on pc said he could n't get it to work with any variation of timing and that it must have been done cancelling into a heavy and then a dagger cancel ... ..but i know the difference between the second half of her zone and her raw heavies and what i 've seen is not raw heavies being dagger cancelled .
i take selfies in random situations because it 's cool to just view from someone else 's perspective .
i am not narcissistic in the least but am fascinated by my reflection .
barely related but one time i took acid and stood in front of a mirror for about ten decades .
seems crazy to me there are places that leave safety standards in the hands of the general public though !
hi i 'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image
this guy 's entire account is dedicated to hating on all sbg fighters yet he calls people pussies lol
i 'm really not sure how many people hate this but i love the sound of construction and the constant background noise it makes .
i mostly like it when it 's cloudy which i like too .
one time my next-door neighbors ' house burnt down and at the time i liked to spend time outside in the cloudy weather and the sound of reconstructing the poor house for months on end was comforting for some reason .
i am saving l d for last but will definitely do them as every bit helps .
i feel like this is later in his career..he looks a little older .
if anyone can offer any help or direction it would be much appreciated !
edit i 'm leaning toward after 1981 because of the kangaroos he 's rocking..
so you ignored the post that did explain how you were misrepresenting any context with that quote '' and instead replied to the one that did n't and when i pointed it out you still did n't reply to that post .
lysander grins back and gives his idiot yet another kiss .
imo lizardmen fit the neutral category best they care about execution of great plan and if it requires razing a couple of empire city they 'd do it with no qualms .
insert meta discord reference that no one on here would get
if you have dark hair laser hair removal is usually the best option .
if you have light or red hair electrolysis is your only option .
i was googling about for the same reason and the consensus was this is just unfinished content .
sanders lacks allies and connections and has never shown experience in crafting and executing policy plans .
i doubt sanders would be more effective than trump although at least we can be sure he would n't be antagonizing our allies or the kims .
a desperately-needed £5.1billion would go straight into the health service to end the winter crisis .
so he is seriously claiming that just chucking money at the problem would solve the problem and end the winter crisis '' ?
low staff levels mean existing staff are already working beyond their capabilities .
what are they to do with it which will end the winter crisis ?
longer than the winter crisis will last in all probability .
why did he have to fuck it up with that massively exaggerated claim ?
maybe to take attention away from the fact that he plans only to tax the most well off a sign of things to come perhaps .
and also the fact that he 's not addressing cuts in social services food banks or a the myriad of other problems that the tories have created .
the shadow chancellor 's nhs budget would be just that .
so the very next time that corbyn gets up to criticise tory spending on anything other than the nhs may can return his easy lob with a smash every single time the hon gentleman criticises my policies but as we all know his own shadow budget from his own shadow chancellor gave no new money to this area .
you 've failed to answer either of my questions .
i was downvoted because cars are considered cool '' so my comment appears to have been made with malice .
my question is do people into expensive keyboards have expensive tastes in general or are they really just into the keyboards ?
to me it seems like it has to be just the keyboards despite how frivolous a nice keyboard is to me .
he carries around too much muscle to ever have much of a gas tank hills or not .
if i didnt know better i 'd say she 's just trolling him to expose how huge of a bigot he really is .

its almost like shes the perfect troll shes everything he either 1 hates or 2 wishes he was .
servers go up and down from time to time .
i dont know who runs them but they dont seem to watch the server all that much they get over loaded or crash or what ever and takes them a few days before fixxing it .

played about half of this list yes i am an old bastard .
i think the old adventure games are my all time faves indiana jones sam n max day of the tentacle and of course monkey island though you forgot the original .
i think that despite their age the storylines and writing in these games would still hold up today if younger people wanted to check them out .
how do you get the units with the purple tags ?
keep a candle in the window for her and be there for her when she checks back in .
democrats made a funny meme arguing that this is all the republicans fault so it must be true !
nice just picked him up on my waivers on a 13 teamer even without an ir spot i would never drop him lol thinking about getting mllsap too lol
nuh uh i bet it 's only like 120 years old max .
well let 's get this out of the way you 're wrong .
we do n't want to have another monika incident .
like how the goal was not to lower the rates of people being killed in concentration camps but to stand up for the rights of the people being killed in them .
getting rid of the concentration camps and freeing the people was n't a goal ?
not if you soak in a bath tub full of lotion like mr. danaher
sounds like it 'd be terrible to get fixed .
one-hundred-fifty-six leagues of treacherous sky so far in distance that not even tempests of solar wind would reach the other end .

it 's a great community who have dealt with a ton of situations in a blended family and give great advice .
even if you are n't the step parent in this situation they 'll welcome your story and provide great advice from their experiences !
fun facts the pyramids where not built by slaves https www.usnews.com/science/articles/2010/01/12/egypt-new-find-shows-slaves-didnt-build-pyramids
the builders came from poor egyptian families from the north and the south and were respected for their work — so much so that those who died during construction were bestowed the honor of being buried in the tombs near the sacred pyramids of their pharaohs . ''
i 'm a big career mode guy so i do n't mind playing squad battles every week .
it 's possible to root the verizon variant but quite complicated .

debating whether a the jesus of the bible existed .
if by the jesus of the bible '' you are refering to the guy that performed miracles then you are very wrong .
the debate about a historical jesus is between two positions .
1 a real person is not the basis for christianity .
2 a real person is the basis for christianity .
there is a third category of jesuses but it has absolutely nothing to do with this debate the supernatural jesus .
if a historical jesus did exist he did not perform miracles he was not the son of a god he was not a sacrifice that saved everyones souls .
the position that you put forward is in line with the historical jesus position .
i wanted clarification on this so i asked you so you believe in a historical jesus ?
so i will ask you again do you believe in a historical jesus ?
and just to further clarify a historical jesus is just a man .
when passed up on them take them all and make your own kingdom .
tfw you 're banned in a default sub you never post in .
instant cast is awesome i use it on situational abilities or to make a quick getaway .
use insta cast on abilities on the gods you are confident on .
it really steps up your game and is worth every bit .
like thors 3 is knockup immune while channeling so if you have an incoming baccus flop pop your 3 to immune it .
then use your 2 to stop him from burping and youre good to go .
i would love to see the old talents used .

it 's been a while since i messed around with ortho but you are right i 've been using the builtin mesh .
in some regions all i ever got from ortho was ocean .
for instance down town cape town would be completely flooded .
i thought it was due to an elevation mismatch that put the new mesh inder sea-level but i 've had the same thing happen in the swedish mountains .
same result with different sources and using the built in mesh .
it 's really hard to see what you 're referring to especially since stone is irregular and can be spotted naturally .
can you describe it better or zoom in on the spots ?

'' an annual survey conducted by the federal reserve board found that 44 percent of adult americans claim they could not come up with 400 in an emergency without turning to credit cards family and friends or selling off possessions .
when this reality combines with healthcare bills the consequences can be financially devastating .
to a european it 's a horrifying thought to have to sell possessions to be able to take my child to the emergency room .
spoiler the clue for getting the joke is to taking in account the negative values as well .
whatever the situation is i 'm so sorry you got a call like that .
i got a similar call a year and a half ago and confirmed on my way to the airport that yes my dad was dead .
if his wife mentioned what hospital i highly recommend calling them because i would n't expect them to notify you if his next of kin is already there .
to answer your question i do n't have a particular waking-up moment in mind but i love the process of waking up in a hotel on vacation .
waking up a little disoriented by strange sheets and unfamiliar walls then remembering where you are then remembering that there 's nothing you have to do besides finding some tasty food and enjoying yourself .
you have to decide which you prefer the discomfort of breaking out of your shell and cultivating some social skills through exposure therapy and repeated rejections and making slow inchworm-like progress that slowly accumulates over time like compound interest in a savings account until you find someone you like that deems you a suitable member of the opposite sex or the pain emotional turmoil of being foreveralone .
there 's just too much competition and dating makes me feel like i 'm something i 'm not .

to be honest given that almost all countries start off with a fairly high amount of estate privileges i think that a blanket 5-10 corruption for all countries would allow the game to represent the situation more clearly rather than having to wait 50 years for it to reach that point .
though maybe it 'd cripple the aim too much as they 're not particularly good at handling the mod as it is .
i 'd do anything just to get you by my side ...

honestly though if btc finds support at the 200day ma around 8-9k that 's good for the long term stability of crypto .

nah fuck off he was happy to sign a 5 year contract for 125k a week 5 months prior declaring his love for the club and hope he wants to stay .
then as soon as we turn shit he puts in absolutely no effort and refuses to play again with no talk of an unsettled family .
he even asked for a pay rise after brexit because of the exchange rates .
i wish it could 've worked out but he 's a cunt who threw all the love the fans gave him back in our face .
the only mentions of him going back to see his family are rumours you 'd have thought he 'd have come out and said it .
he was causing so much disruption in our squad that even kouyate had him up against the wall and noble said he had n't spoken to him in weeks when he left .
he also went on record to say he knows how to be an arsehole and force his way out of a club with a smirk on his face .
absolute cunt he can fuck off even if it was family issues it does n't excuse what he did .
my highlight of the english summer will always be bairstow chasing balls going down third man/fine leg in his keeping gear .
this reminds me of a girl i went to middle school with .
i did n't find out just how crazy her lies got until later .
the story of how i came to know her and her stories almost seems like a lie itself .
where sheltered 13 or 14 year old me took something someone handed to me for my headache ...
so i do n't exactly remember all the events of the night .
so when she came to me saying that we had started dating at the party ... me being a huge introvert and scared to argue just went with it .
now it may be just the passage of time messing with my memory .
maybe it was months later but i feel like it was only 2 weeks or so later when she claims we had sex at the party and that she is pregnant .
i 'm an introverted sheltered idiot kid with ultra conservative parents .
the accidental drug use is enough to make my dad kill me .
getting a girl pregnant and not even remembering my first sex ...
a month or so go by with us pretty much only talking at school .
she tells me some stories about how her uncle works for nasa .
her mother is in the witness protection program and i would know her real name if she told me .
i 'm just still scared about having this kid so this stuff does n't even phase me at the time .
so a few months later it is the end of the school year .
once summer starts i do n't see or hear from her for weeks .
a couple more weeks into the summer i find out her father 's job moved out of state and they had already packed up and left town .
my dumb ass is still scared about this pregnancy .
even though i 've thought about it and with her stories it just does n't add up .
when the next school year starts i talk to some of her friends '' and that 's when they tell me she was a pathological liar .
that at least 2 of them saw us talking .
then proceed to tell me some of her stories she had told them .
her uncle was in the mob not sure if it 's the same one that worked for nasa
her dad was working for the phone company because he was actually installing back doors for the cia to monitor a specific family a semi influential family locally in this small town because he was a spy of some sort .
her mom had discovered a way to cure something maybe cancer ... maybe that 's why she was in witness protection ?
she had already graduated but her parents made her go to school so she would fit in '' with kids her age .
they told me there is no way anything happened and not to worry .
it all seems silly now and that means i would have a 24 to 25 year old now if it were true .
tl dr girl claims to have family in the mafia the cia and curing disease .
also that i got her pregnant when we did n't have sex .
just been to check them out they have some interesting plants i 've never seen before .
this depends on whether it is cornish or devon clotted cream .
the former is generally pretty solid more like soft butter .
the belittlement is more towards op who i 've messaged to in another post here .
from the short time i 've been here i 've seen quite a bit of post of people who abused kratom and got themselves addicted then try to blame kratom as the devil .
but in the scope of all that 's in the sub i feel like there is much more extremely positive this drug is a miracle and has no bad things '' posts than there are these overly negative ones .
personally i just believe that regardless of if people will listen to the advice we should keep trying to help them and offer support no matter what .
i think that will serve as a better warning call to new inexperienced kratom users .
as a former addict myself i understand the anger and attempt to deflect blame from oneself .
sooner or later they 'll have to face themselves .
i agree that their intent is probably not to spread harm reduction but i do n't believe their real intent is malicious either .
in my experience the public outcry of an addict towards their drug of choice is usually an open plea for help .
same and ppl told me pine is n't apex level when he had to play for lw red in the tank meta days .

they definitely legally can and morally will justify advertising lower impedance headphones based on the logic that low impedance headphones usually produce a higher volume with less voltage so even with a voltage drop due to output impedance they are listenable past the point of hurting your ears .
so altering the headphone intended sound signature can almost be considered a health benefit dropping the volume that lower impedance headphones can produce while still producing a lot of volume for higher impedance headphones that wo n't experience as much of a voltage drop .
but as a consequence a lot of headphones will have emphasis where they have higher electrical impedance and wo n't sound as designed .
u need to have been a follower for 3 months to chat now i think atleast in the variety stream yesterday .
i 've hold morata for a long time waiting for his goals ... thanks for that red card ...
because if you do you 're applying for pac coin to be removed from cryptopia
they do n't swallow the shit like pac dev team does .
they remove pac in a blink of an eye .
in that case you 've just made your and other 's investment worthless all by yourself .
i 've never used one of these but there 's a design principle that if you need a workaround to use the device then the device does n't work properly .
just saying not to belittle the preferences of others and to seek out varied experience really .
i have gynophobia which is the near of sex more specifically vaginal penetration .
because of this for the longest time i desperately wanted to be
normal '' and so i would convince myself if i just tried and tried to get stuff in there and have sex it would solve things .
so my vagina gets very tense nothing can really get in there .
after so much of feeling like and disappointment and broken i feel really sexually drained and go months not feeling sexual or aroused .
i am slowly working on it with a therapist and exploring my own body so i have one day have a healthy and happy sex life which is what i want .
i 'd suggest your girlfriend talks to a therapist .
she might need that without you at first to help her figure out if that 's something that is happening .
i think that 's exaggerating but they all talk like they have n't watched an arsenal game this season
some people just are n't dog people so that should n't really be a big issue .
in saying that of course you have a say as whether or not another person moves into the apartment you and your sister share .
the other side being that your sister has a serious relationship and is looking to start a life together with her bf .
that usually involves moving in together so if you do n't want him to move in then your time living with your sister may be coming to an end .
you need to take risks but do n't forget safety first .
i manage it pretty well so i come across as ‘normal ' which is double edged sword .
tell them that more people are really good at overwatch than people who are really good at football .
but football has more professional players than overwatch does .
it is literally easier to become a football player than be coming the next seagull .

dodge tank kind of lost its charm in season two .
good for you for not letting things keep you down .

i used double gold card 8pm day 1 meaning 8pm day 1 5am day 2 i have 1000 gold cap .
after reset on 5am then from 5am day 2 to 8pm day 2 resetted cap is still 1000 .
it will become 500 gold cap after it expires .
not sure with this but if my assumption is correct then if you 'll use another double gold card 9pm day 2 .
you 'll have 1000 gold cap again with only 500 being used .
i wonder if that guy 's just pretending to not speak english now that the jig is up .
you can find them on amazon for around 40 bucks .
hey that would take a really long time to explain in depth .
but the general gist of it is when you see that she likes you you gradually start talking about increasingly sexual topics ramp up intimate touching get her thinking about sex with you show her that you 're a sexual person without any judgment keep intense eye contact with her and so on and so forth .
would take a whole separate article to explain how to do it properly .
have n't really decided yet or a secret deal with the allies or the axis but still have n't decided .
a lot of labour also voted ukip it was n't a tory only affair .
11 of ukip voters voted for labour in the next election .
45 of ukip voters voted for conservatives in the next election .
nothing is black and white but to say it 's comparable is misleading .
labour had ending freedom of movement in their manifesto that clearly showed they were not going to stay in the single market .
you can read their brexit policy at the ge 2017 here .
you might be able to forgive people for confusing that with not leaving the eu .
it 's basically leave the eu but keep everything the same .
they either do n't care as much about brexit as other things

i think gladiators red eyes and ancient gears are the best candidates for tier 1
cheap arguably the most effective deck at keeping card advantage and can be run in a myriad of ways .
red eyes is easily now the most consistent and effective beatdown deck that can get out big monsters fast and usually carries decent backrow removal .
ancient gears are the cards that work best with electro that alone makes them very good .
idk about t1 with them i 'm fairly certain the others are t1 but certainly t2 imho .
to play optimally it needs your opponent to attack your facedown while you have fki out which almost never happens vs a good player .
it bricks more than average and usually has a turn where they are wide open for an attack because phoenix is dead .
hazys are a tough one to place but i 'd say tier 2 .
they are inconsistent but are probably the hardest deck to beat one they get a beast rising off on a sphynx .
the best things about glads phoenix hazy and ags being played more is that burn is played less since it is n't ideal vs any of those decks .
it 'll still be around because it 's still a good overall deck but less seen since it 's no longer a hard counter to the meta like it was during the ca and ninja days .

i 'm pretty sure to surpass the azeotropic limit 96 you need to use the fraction distillation method .
this relies on many rounds of vaporizing/condensing to optimize the distillation .
could be wrong though it 's been a while .
this is harder to do on a larger scale so it 's easier to just cap the alcohol production at 96

this https ufixers.com/d/1020-i9195-sandisk-emmc-data-recovery is my recent case still waiting for someone else to confirm or help to pick correct settings but this is either 3rd or 4th s4 mini i9195 in my case with failed emmc that i ca n't get data off after chip-off .
it 's impossible that all of them failed after extracting and i 'm doing this on weekly basis .
each one worked fine then powered-off and could n't be turned on again pc sometimes detectes them as qdloader 9008 which suggests the issue .
there still might be a way to get data off from such a chip but it costs much more and require to you to get into the nand chip inside the emmc bypassing the controller something like monolithic sd/microsd cards data recovery and ofc no warranty that you 'll be able to get the data correctly or at all .
completely agree ! i never understood how can people look at halving kids so casually .
if you 're not a retard then you should have a plan b incase something happenes to your job .

i 've recently been playing blake stone planet strike my interest revived by my steam controller and am absolutely loving the soundtrack especially plot .
it does a great job at providing gravity to the situation and gets the player pumped to start the mission .
and it does this with very limited channels and opportunity for the wide expression that we hear even in today 's retro influenced games .
so what are some of your favorite tracks or entire soundtracks from dos games ?
if you could only choose 5 drugs for recreational/therapeutic use what would you chose ?
these drugs have both therapeutic and recreational use depending on the dose .
i love them all equally because they are tools like hammers drills saws crowbar etc .
all of those drugs are unique and have their own purpose .
they can be mixed to feel like an entirely different drug .
this is what r/drugs fails to understand for them its only lsd and weed .
but these 'hard drugs ' can be used responsibly and i have been able to do for 3 years now once every 7 to every 14 days .
1 gram of pure 90 lab tested heroin or meth lasts me 4/5 months and a lot of the times its used in low doses for therapeutic use for my mild adhd and to help my bad social anxiety for job interviews dates etc or to get very important work that needs to be done .
so i use them for both recreational and therapeutic .
its removes the harsh edge without dulling the trip i love this combo when walking out in nature .
visuals are of pretty things instead of ugly things this combo is best taken out in nature .
heroin forces good vibes regardless of set and setting .
ego death becomes painless and you just accept it as opiates are shown in studies to block the 'fight or flight response ' which gets kicked in during ego death as the ego wants to desperately hold on heroin taught me to not fear having the ego ripped away from me and being ego-less without fear is a very interesting experience .
it helped me trip without the use of opiates as i was shown how to not fear ego death .
pardon the walls of text i 'm on some gear right now after a 7 day break .
i am all about conserving some money/getting the biggest bang for my buck so i am trying to find a company that sells full-spectrum cbd vape items .
most of the ones i 've seen are cbd only unfortunately disappointing because i really wanted to order from johnnyapplecbd and it appears that they 're cbd only !
what 's your guy 's opinion on kendrick 's most underrated song ?
imo it 's sing about me i 'm dying of thirst '' .
i know that any person who 's listened to gkmc will say it 's a great song but i think it 's the best song on the album and deserves more recognition .
keisha 's song '' or ronald reagan era '' come to a close second for me .
i only play the java version of minecraft and host a server from my home .
my friends and i find it hard to continue playing the game after a few days into a world .
we have infinite resources so quickly and there 's no motivation to explore the rest of the world because it is too large .
i recently saw the minetest video where a spherical world was created .
my friends and i all agree that minecraft would be a lot more fun for a lot longer if there was an option to play a world like that .
we even discussed a world that remains flat but as you reach the border the other side is loaded in .
this would create the illusion of a sphere world and still allow players to walk entirely around it .
do n't blame the other townies if they lynch an innocent and the vote is like 2 to 1 .
if you 're repeating offenses expect a probation period to take effect .
if you 're on probation everything goes up a level .
time of probation will be determined by issue frequency and severity at that time .
so if you 're doing lots of minimal offenses you 'll be told you 're working on a higher level and then everything goes up a notch .
zero tolerance for flaming name calling trolling or disrespectful comments to others .
i ca n't in good conscious have a zero tolerance here .
1 we all have a moment where we get a little tense in a heated debate and might call a name or step over the line .
jumping right to ban is an over correction i ca n't justify .
2 some people will use this to goad people into a fight just to get them banned .
as a main post however this jumps all the way to high .
i 'm not going to have internet drama plague the sub .
you 'll get one warning and i 'm removing the post .
the new wording of the rule will be attack ideas not people .
if i come in and things are way out of hand and you 're breaking the rules too ... event to defend yourself enjoy being lumped in with the instigator .
no naming and shaming '' meaning do not call out any member of the sota community players developers support personnel moderators etc .
with the intention of ridiculing shaming or making them the subject of public accusation .
this also falls under the attack ideas not people rule .
posts need to be about the game or something the community can participate in .
your specific experience be it banning quitting a sweet new sword you got or whatever is n't really constructive .
the subject of the post needs to be about something other than you .
1 there is almost always a more constructive way to get the same info into the forum .
example recently there was a post about a banning .
this leaves the community talking about one person and one event .
it would be better if there was a text post about let 's talk about forum bannings ! and the first comment is the submitter and their story .
this opens up not only the ability for people to talk about that event but add their own stories and contribute in a more visible way .
2 when it 's about you it 's really really really hard to not end up at some point talking about you .
or attacking the person who did this to you .
seriously this should n't even need to be said .
please participate in subreddit discussions and do not only post links .
it 'll still be a request but honestly if you just want to post some good links and duck out i 'm not going to be upset .
if you 're posting trash i 'll ask you to stop .
the mods reserve the right to remove any material that is deemed offensive illegal inappropriate off topic or low effort .
the mods reserve the right to remove any person or post from the sub .
i am not going to get dragged into days of debating my decision .
i will try to talk to you about why i made the decision but not going to argue about the meaning of a word or the way i moderate for endless amounts of time .
this gives me the leeway to not have to debate the nuance of every time i find someone breaking the rules .
do not repost any material that has been removed or moderated .
support issues need to go through the official support system .
this was where most of the bans already in place came from .
i will enforce it with a high rate of punishment .
in addition to just being offensive it really damages people wanting to enter the community .
any slur of any kind at any group of people falls under this .
if you 're not sure if something constitutes a slur in my mind message me and i 'll let you know .
i will post these rules tomorrow at the latest .
three matches my team has been steamrolled with point differences of 5k .
why is there no team shuffling in a modern triple a shooter ?
after a few months of absence i 'm really hoping to connect with a few of you lovely ladies .
i 've really gotten to explore my kinks on here with some of you and i really want to keep exploring and talking about this with people that are genuinely interested or turned on by it .
this can take the form of a conversation or a role play which i am still pretty new to but hoping i 'm getting better at !
my names khaliya i 'm 25 black and very curvy .
i 'm probably what you would call a bbw and i 'm pretty tall 5'10 '' with an hourglass waist .
for those of you interested i do have the earth mother '' figure a big round ass and a 40h bust .
my boyfriends is a big sweet friendly guy tall and while not a body builder very strong .
the thing is he also has a massive cock .
i do n't mean big i mean a real honest to goodness hung like a horse giant floppy dick ... .and i spend hours every day thinking about other girls playing with it .
it 's become a fantasy focal point for me and i love talking about it .
ideally i 'm looking for another curvy woman to talk to someone fun and friendly open and playful kind and caring .
i 'm not looking for a supermodel or anything ... i just want to chat and have fun ... maybe some sexy fun .
if this catches your attention i 'd love to talk to you .
rule one please write more than 6 words i want to have a real conversation that we 're both interested in having i do n't just want to talk about what i want him to do to you .
rule two no boys i 'm not interested in him sharing me that 's not my fantasy .
rewatching the show or just listening to this https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zxkkdp-hace index=12 list=pliezgr60tx3x2g1z_51zkxt9xbdr3uq1u makes me want to cry .
this show was what i watched whenever i was in a bad mood .
when they made that easter egg in rick and morty it just made me depressed that we probably wo n't see the cast together again at least until the movie ?
i 'm graduating this semester but had a personal emergency recently and had to switch my whole schedule last minute .
i just need one more class to fill in and found these capstones .
i was wondering if anybody has taken them and know how the class professors are ?
i 've had my nipple pierced for about 2 years and they will do fine for a while and then out of nowhere they will start getting crusted and such and occasionally they will get what look like little pimples on the side .
i 'm not able to take a picture because my camera is messed up but wanted to know if anyone had dealt with this or had any advice .
it only last a couple days and i live out in the middle of nowhere so when i make it to the city to see piercer they do n't look bad .
none of my other piercings have had these problems .
so i have never golfed before but i 'm really excited to start getting into golfing .
already signed up for a lesson and i 'm looking to buy a cheap set of clubs just to start out with and to take to the driving range .
i found a nice set of powerbilt golf clubs on craigslist barely used .
i 'm a beginner obviously but i have never heard of powerbilt .
since i started drinking wine months ago i 've been keeping my unfinished wine in the cabinet for over a week sometimes .
i do n't like drinking my wine cold do most people drink it cold ?
also i have a half bottle of dry riesling in my cabinet and it 's been there for over a week is it done ?
i wanted so much more a repeat awesome last minute win for you .
normally if it was the lions yeah i 'd like that .
but this was pretty much the opposite of what i had in mind for tonight .
as a lions fan it 's unknown territory to have a win mean that much this far into the boss levels .
i was really looking forward to a vikings home rampage of the patriots .
nothings worse than a smug pats fan ... . other than maybe a cheesehead .
so you have a pretty rare event here with the eagles coming in to town after this disgusting loss .
they made you look bad and now they 're inviting themselves over to use your stuff ?
i 'd probably just gripe about it with other fans but it 's enough to make me root for the packers if they were hypothetically the other team ... . maaaaaybe .
now it 's an honest question here do you as vikings fans boycott watching the superbowl cheer for the eaglets or cheer for the pats ?
assuming most fans feel the same way about the patriots being something of a super ftp situation .
we got into the village at around at 0800 what we saw there will stick with me forever .
it was no man that did these things no man can crush a person with a jeep laying on top of them wrecked to hell no man can take a person and tear them apart no man can do the things that no normal person could imagine in their right mind .
i was never a godly man but if i was..i 'd say the devil found that town and when he did god turned away from it
19th of june 1944 i james barnes and 11 others buried more than 100 people .
over 40 of whom were children of various ages .
in the middle of the village we came upon a tall oak tree but the nature of this tree was not practical as it seemed to have been there for a time much shorter than the age of the village .
before reaching the tree we had came upon multiple scenes of violence of where it seemed people were butchered where they stood but were dragged away like the prey killed by the lion .
all 124 people.. all of them were dragged away to that tree .
19th of june 1944 we have just secured the village we sent out a detail to inform the colonel of our position and status .
they was none too happy to have to make the trip twice but they guessed it was better out there than in a village with a lot of blood and a lot of bodies .
i feel we are going to need them because god help us all when whatever slaughtered this village decides to come
21st of june 1944 our detail still has n't come back their a couple days overdue.. we 're all starting to get a little restless waiting on the krauts or ... something else..
22nd of june 1944 we 're all getting kind of antsy bakerson and mansworth found a kraut on the edge of town it semed like he had been there for a couple days .
what was stranger was that his gun was empty likely broken he was hungry ... . and scared .
i ordered the men to keep an eye out for any more krauts that might wander into us .
23rd of june 1944 we are getting ready to leave and move on to the next town we 've been here too long already .
mansworth last night he said he had a nightmare something about monsters and demons .
i think that time we spent here has gotten to him we 're packing and saddling up in an hour .
sanders and one other are scouting the road ahead i 'm hoping he can find us a way out and we can continue on with the mission .

but do not worry for this whole universe will be expanded upon so stay tuned

in all of torbjorn 's victory poses he is in some way physically or mentally harming his turret .
in the pose sitting pretty '' http i.imgur.com/psojm5e.jpg he is sitting on top of his turret with a menacing grin on his face he 's proud to punish his turret and it gives him pleasure .
in take five '' https i.ytimg.com/vi/vtma2zxooau/maxresdefault.jpg toblerone is shoving his turrets face to the ground to lean on him .
again with an evil grin that shows he feels no empathy towards his turret .
in hammer '' https i.pinimg.com/236x/48/90/80/4890806098b68e391200184069b27422 cosplay.jpg he holds up the tool he uses to beat his turret in a triumphant pose .
in his default pose you can tell he 's reminiscing about the times he whips his turret .
his medal http i.imgur.com/qiesilx.jpg pose is probably the worst torbjorn is strangling his turret to steal it 's medal .
yet again while smiling as if he receives pleasure from this .
torbjorn also hits his turret to make it work harder instead of actually talking to it and motivating it kindly .
i would like the devs to change this the poses the mechanic of using his hammer to beat turret as it brings back some painful memories i do n't want to relive .
i just had a player on the enemy team disconnect for about 8-10 minutes and just join back like nothing happened

so far the sub has appeared in wired on npr and on the yanss podcast .
snorrrlax has mentioned several times in the cmv podcast that he 's been in contact with academics interested in mining cmv 's delta system for research .
not only is this a breach of users ' trust in a politically fraught world it could also expose them to serious backlash .
in addition the increased attention has exposed it to hordes of shills and trolls from both sides of the aisle who daily violate both the rules and spirit of the sub with impunity seeking only to out-echo out-trigger and out-delta each other .
if this nonsense reaches critical mass the mods will feel greater pressure to use heavy-handed curating that could easily devolve into censorship if it has n't already .
i know when players in ultimate team games get injured they have a percent chance to get overcome that injury and become healed .
if they do heal are they still injured after the game and require healing cards or no ?
hey there everyone much like a lot of you it 's been my dream to go to a top business school although i love penn state and from my experience i think the education is great i wish i made into a more prestigious school but i was during a tough time of my life during high school.i think i 've done a lot then but i 've come a long way i understand i might be thinking about this quite early but i ideally want to do my mba soon after i graduate due to some circumstances .

in the update notes and in reddit it says 127
this is the best tl dr i could make original https www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-21/turkey-attacks-kurds-in-syria-as-u-s-warnings-ignored reduced by 79 .
turkey pushed ahead with a ground offensive against kurdish forces in northwest syria in defiance of the u.s. to create what it called a security buffer along the border .
the move pits turkey against a u.s.-backed force that played a crucial role in defeating islamic state in syria .
turkey considers the ypg a terrorist group linked to kurdish separatists fighting government forces at home .
turkey says it is invoking self-defense under international law assuring syria that the offensive was solely targeting quot terrorists quot and that its forces would pull out after meeting its goals .
turkey has been outraged by plans to include thousands of kurdish fighters in a border security force being created by the u.s.-led coalition against islamic state .

long story short the dealership called me and told me that there is a salvage title on the bike that neither they or the guy they bought it off of were aware of .
turns out he probably dealt with a shifty insurance company whenever he laid the bike down .
the bike runs great and is in perfect condition save a couple of scrapes .
asking how much money i should renegotiate for in the price of the bike .
my insurance is sure to go up now that i have a salvage title .
so we 've been married for 13 years now and our sex life has diminished significantly over the last few years up to the point where we have done nothing at all for the last seven months .
my wife has been dealing with a lot of varying emotions about the issue but has recently firmly identified as asexual .
this was difficult for me to accept but i have begun to as divorce is not an option since we still love each other very much .
i guess the first question is basically what do i do ?
i 've tried the friends with benefits thing with one other woman and found it unsatisfying without the emotional connection .
my wife understands this and is even comfortable with me finding someone that would be on par with her on an emotional basis .
the second question would be how easy have any of you found bringing this up in a conversation with other folks ?
i 've tried to look on dating apps and all i seem to find are people who are just dtf and do n't mind that i 'm married not for me or are poly themselves but inconveniently far away .
the third question is that since my wife is very firm in that we have very little to no chance of any physical relationship in the future is it appropriate for me to still look for someone who would be physically monogamous with me and does that still fall within the polyamory spectrum ?
i 'd really appreciate any advice anyone might have or even answers to questions i may not have thought to ask .
this is also all pretty new to me so if any of what i 've asked is inappropriate i very sincerely apologize .

my buddies and i just started playing today and we loved our first session but i just need help clarifying my personal goal which involves killing a certain number of monsters . ''
does monster '' mean any opponent we come across in a dungeon or only non-human or is there some classification of what a monster is ?
i do n't want to be counting the wrong things and then be retried too quickly .
maybe 13 years ago i remember seeing a screen cap of a pc game on whichever internet board i was scanning through at the time where users would post in game screenshots of what their pcs at the time could handle .
it was a shooter perhaps very dark themed office building cactus plant on the desk and an in-game character that somewhat resembled newman from seinfeld .
the graphics at the time looked phenomenal for a kid growing up without a pc capable of hardly running the sims .
i 'm sorry i have absolutely no further knowledge of how to explain what i 'm trying to remember seeing the screen cap of but this has literally bothered me for years now .

i 've been slowly creeping up there but i rolled a 576 tonight 181/193/202 !
only opened two of the thirty frames and hit every ten pin .
so i 've been playing tarkov for awhile and i ca n't stand factory .
i 'm not a bad player by any means .
i do n't have gear fear i 'm capable of holding my own solo and against groups .
but the kind of emergent game play i get from tarkov just is n't there on factory .
i never realized why people bitched about 'hatchlings ' in this game most of the other maps i play i run into geared and pimped out players customs shoreline have very few hatchlings that i 've encountered and while they may pop in from time to time they 're not that prevalent .
jump to factory had to play it to complete a mission .
i open the door to see three hatchlings bolting for the main three story room then i see a guy with m4/fort beginning to mow them down in single file .
i picked a shotgun because you know close level maps typically a friendly shotgun enviroment not versus a forted player .
i died so i respawned rinse repeat it seems at least 3 out of six players sport hatchets and i know why they 're doing it they 're trying to complete the same mission i 'm doing .
although some guy that absolutely jerks off to this map sits camping the catwalks with an m4 ranking his exp up .
you can go in and mow down scavs in single file .
it 's so tightly packed that nobody plays it safe and they just bolt down hallways trying to complete their objective .
lingering in one spot too long some guys going to round the corner and put a bullet in the back of your head .
and that 's fine i just hope they do n't make more maps like it .
because the survival hardcore element feels lost to me in it .
it 's just a bunch of low-tier guys trying to complete a mission while high-tier guys just want to bump their rank and k/d up .
there 's not much to loot safely most boxes are forgotten about because they leave you extremely exposed only one solid safe .
jump to shoreline most unpopular map due to people claiming it 's laggy for me it plays just fine .
the loot is fairly spread out spawns more so .
it 's more difficult to determine where players are going to bolt too .
and while there is a very 'popular ' area players might try to farm if you bolt down hallways carelessly you sound the alarm to other sneakier players and they will punish you for that .
it 's a completely different kind of gameplay style .
it 's a more strategic ' style of gameplay .
customs is similar if you can make it through the first five minutes it 's generally anyones game .
it 's spread out enough you can choose to engage or bolt the other way .
doing hatchet runs on factory is simply just to bump up your trader score because to be honest there really is n't dick to loot .
i hope they expand factory make it less of a deathmatch and more of a tactical supportive game .
all in all it makes engagements with other players seem more special .
you get worried that there 's a guy you know is a pmc and has a good chance of killing you .

i 'm a daily smoker and have been for 3 years i decided to quit and the first night not smoking i had my first lucid dream !
it only lasted about 30 seconds it was so random too which was weird i did n't do a reality check or a wbtb or anything it just happened i suddenly became aware !
i could n't believe how real it felt and all the details around me !
i was at a caravan park i looked around which was an amazing sensation and saw cars parked i could see the registration plates i could see people walking around and each person had a different face !
i got all excited which then unfortunately woke me up !
i did n't know lucid dreams felt this real !
i know they 're on a spectrum and this was probably on the lowest level which is amazing !
i wonder how they feel when its on the highest level of lucidity !
so ive got a track and it samples pretty extensively but im planning to put it out for free .
if im not using it for any commercial purposes do i still need to clear the samples ?
was light sensitivity ever mentioned as a trait of terrans prior to discovery ?
at its heart the socialist perspective sees labor as exploited by the forces of capital or at best as another special interest group unwittingly in the capitalist dogfight .
to this end man is seen as more free and flourishing in systems where he has an actual voice power and control over his circumstances of work and livelihood .
most often it is through some form of direct democracy .
in essence socialism can be seen as an extension of the political mechanism of democracy into the economic sphere the power of our dollars made subordinate to the power of our votes 1 vote for 1 person regardless of wealth or class .
i will exclude the post-scarcity folks/enlightened technocrats from this analysis as that would be another post .
there is no clear consensus on the precise form which these political mechanisms will take .
yet so long as you are a socialist that eschews state capitalism '' state planning the recurring themes seem to be the following
systems of voting in which leaders are directly accountable and immediately replaceable
i want to consider a system of democracy in which the above are made possible .
our current system depending on your country or locale holds elections yearly or every few years with the occasional referendum .
now we can all see the problems when we can only vote so infrequently as our needs and circumstances are always subject to change .
ideally we would have some political mechanism whereby our votes and the demands behind those votes are immediately received and implemented .
consider how often we would need to vote to accurately reflect this .
it would seem that not even this would be enough to account for the dynamism of human activity .
individuals in complex societies are constantly processing new information and adapting at the micro-level .
the best system would be one in which we are quite literally voting and communicating our preferences on everything every moment of every day .
what democratic mechanism could possibly be capable of doing this ?
the answer is a counterintuitive one for it is only in the market where we vote every moment not at the ballot box but through our actions .
it is not simply how we use our money but also the communities we embrace or reject the skills we develop or cast aside the belief systems we subscribe to .
socialists are quite correct in saying that our decisions are bounded by the limitations imposed on us by our circumstances .
but our actions do not exist in a vacuum every action transmits information among a vast network of relationships between human beings .
if we are bounded by particular circumstances as we all ultimately are our actions our votes '' will be a reflection of our preferences '' given those constraints .
this knowledge this information indicates to others where time energy and resources are best utilized .
the more efficiently this information is relayed the more quickly we are able to actually create the conditions that enable higher '' human preferences .
now contrast this with the democratic '' political realm .
if we wish to address a problem here we must operate through a middleman politician lobbyist legislator .
this requires a great number of additional steps on our part first we must familiarize ourselves with the legislation that affects our area of concern .
then we must research prospective leaders to see which ones are keen on implementing our policies .
but our vote here is only a loose approximation of the preferences revealed in the multitude of market decisions we make every day .
in fact by further extending the political realm into human affairs we actually dilute the information that must be utilized in order to effect the change we want to see .
amidst all this we must remember that political leaders are in the business of making promises for people .
by the political capital money connections prestige which is directed towards them .
the poor the marginalized the downtrodden are precisely the least likely to have the resources and connections to navigate the political process .
but each of us engages in the market process all the time .
it is simple direct and as democratic a reflection of our sometimes flawed preferences as possible .
it does not require lawyers politicians or lobbyists only the capability to make decisions about our lives .
socialists detest the market for placing a price on at times very difficult human decisions .
but there is always and will always be a price .
the goal is to discover the most accurate one .
to do this we must accept that human behavior is fundamentally economic https www.reddit.com/r/capitalismvsocialism/comments/75gxix/human_behavior_is_fundamentally_economic .
we must reject the idea that prosperity can be planned and instead allow the decentralized efforts of many to coordinate the welfare of all .
the alternative is to slowly whittle away at democracy in the name of preserving it .

imo i do n't have a most overrated album but i think either binaural or riot act is the most underrated album .
so i have been acquainted with sgi for nearly a full year now .
i use the term acquainted '' because truth be told i am not sincerely committed to the belief or practice .
the following is a short description of my story and introduction to sgi .
please scroll down to the next all-caps link if you wish to skip the details
a year ago out in another state for business i met an older woman who was in the same work-program as i was and who needed help with her luggage .
i assisted her and she appreciated the gesture and this lead to further conversations .
eventually she informed me that she was part of sgi and that it miraculously benefited her life and liberated her from her attrition .
being the skeptic and scientifically-preferential person that i am i informed her that people often fall into faith and ascribe benefits to their faith when life has been mercilessly cruel and unrelenting .
nevertheless she insisted that chanting nam myoho renge kyo nmrk really does work and that it has indeed really changed her life for the better .
add to that she told me nearly all of her life story from her early childhood sufferings to her struggles of making a life in america she is a naturalized citizen of more than 30 years .
she noted that when she chanced upon sgi nearly 35 years ago that her life began to change ever so positively the fear of her being unable to obtain her us citizenship or passport in time with the claim that it may take her 5 years to receive was suddenly shortened to 2-3 years the infested apartment she occupied no longer did she have to remain for she got a better household offer the dead-end job she had to contend with top it off with a hostile and disparaging boss she no longer had to bear with for she eventually became the manager of the job and soon obtained a better offer with greater pay you get the idea .
i admit despite my skepticism from her frequent narrations and encouragements that i began attending meetings when we returned to our state .
i attended a ceremony for the youth division and some home meetings and met other people from hard/trying backgrounds who also narrated similar stories of success .
not once did it seem like there was much discussion on traditional ideas of buddhism .
everything was about conspicuous/inconspicuous benefits '' and that like mentioned before sgi has improved their lives better than they were before becoming members and that chanting the mantra of nmrk was the sure way to achieve what you want .
it seems like everytime i attend that i hear these emotionally-challenging yet persistent stories and that i am also mostly made the center of attention .
the guests tell me to try out the practice and to be consistent and see for myself .
just a summary for anyone who skipped the details of my story and who needs to know in order for my follow-up questions i met an older lady i 'm a young guy got told about sgi through her and her challenges and how her life 's all better because of sgi was encouraged by her to attend home and convention meetings met fellow members heard more similar stories of success and now get text messages from time to time about upcoming meetings .
all this and i 'm still skeptical and only attend because the group has good energy yet they insist i continue chanting .
knowing that i attend these groups for their challenging yet positive stories but that i am inquisitive and skeptical of chantings/sgi should i even bother continuing the meetings ?
should i just quit or maybe stop responding altogether from some sgi members who text me ?
do the people who claim their lives have improved by chanting mostly just coincidence ?
could it also be possible that good fortune would happen regardless of chanting ?
also as a result from attending these meetings a fellow member has told me that my name came up from some sgi convention held a few days ago and that it would have been a perfect moment to receive a gohonzon .
i 'm still skeptical and the member and others told me that the gohonzon represents my mind and life and that i must not lose it and i will have to look after it my whole life .
i felt uneasy about these statements and i did not attend that convention despite all their chanting for me to hopefully appear .
my few questions regarding the gohonzon details are why do they encourage me to get a gohonzon despite telling me no pressure '' to get one ?
it seems they tell me each meeting about getting a gohonzon .
another question is the more i attend these meetings but still decline getting gohonzons will something bad happen eventually in respect to me attending these meetings ?
i look forward to any input possible and really appreciate your time and attention to my descriptions and questions .
through raging fires and rumbling storms i sailed across the seas
so that even when i 'm gone the world and you would still be at peace
i raised my sword and sliced through the enemy 's crowd
i felt warm as the blood of my enemies coated me inside and out
okay so i truly hope someone can help with some sense of direction as to who i should see ? .
i have seen 4 different doctors and have had about 25-30 blood tests done in the last few months which have all come back fine .
and after my third child two years ago the symptoms started .
first i could n't swallow and i would choke on my food .
then i lost an unintended 30kg in under 2 months .
i get 8 hours of sleep a night but still i can barely keep my eyes open .
so below to make it easier is a list of my symptoms .
chronic fatigue unintentional weight loss shooting pain down spine that sends chills comparative to when you get a needle and can feel the initial pain through your veins .
tingling in legs shooting pain in legs chronic nausea sever muscle ache tingling left side of face numbness left side of face swollen lymph node behind ear hard does n't move irregular shape and painless .
disorientation confusion anxiety frustration restlessness my eyes not my eyelids shake and twitch .
blurry vision ca n't drive as my eyes feel like they 're about to shut feeling of passing out light headed body feels light and non-existent when i walk .
shooting pain in toes massive loss of appetite massive gain of appetite and the list goes on .
i feel like i 'm just going to drop dead and be another statistic of someone who died of unknown causes .
any kind of direction as to where i can go would be great .
i am hoping one of the revolut team see this and are able to help me .
i withdrew funds to my revolut account and have not been able to access them as it wants me to show my paperwork for verification and limits .
i submitted multiple docs on the chat and was advised would be passed to the team and nobody replies to me .
i paid to be a premium member as it offers 24/7 support and i have had none .
i am feeling very disheartened and hope you can help resolve for me asap .
i am just playing some games and i would love to listen someone while i play .
so you can come and talk about whatever you want .
i can download whatever app you want so feel free to message me and talk about your day or something .

hey everyone so i 've been compiling a list and i have narrowed down my top 3 brands and top 3 flavors for each of those brands .
i was skeptical at first solely because of the name but i figured 240ml for 23 what do i have to lose ?
needless to say i was blown away with the speed i received my order .
i literally got it the next day i did n't know they were in florida which i can safely say has never happened to me with a vape company .
i put these guys at 1 for their shipping speed and service alone the juice was icing on the cake .
think lucky charms with a delicious bowl of milk .
this was a pleasant surprise for me as i love fruity flavors and this one is over the top .
payday they call this one adult milkshake '' i have to agree .
it 's a pretty complex flavor but is highlighted by banana butterscotch bourbon and cream .
i guess that sounds like an adult milkshake to me !
fuggin is a gem in the cheap juice realm .
as we all know you really do n't know what you 're getting in terms of quality until you take the dive for yourself .
i ca n't remember the rabbithole that sent me to fuggin but i do n't regret my purchase one bit .
shipping was a bit delayed but i bought one of their kits and saved about 30 bucks on something i was gon na pay full retail for smok veneneno got my order in about 4 days and really happy with that .
fuggin donuts this is a really good donut flavor .
most companies i have tried havent really got it right but the guys at fuggin clearly got their act together and nailed this one .
i know what you dripped last summer tasty strawberry rice crispies treats is what they should have called this flavor .
really good stuff not an adv but a great one that i keep coming back to .
the silence of the clouds i am a blue raspberry fanatic and they hit this one out of the park .
really gives you that cool sensation with the sour blue combo is a one two punch for me .
price 24.99 for 120ml or bogo if you do it right
humble was the first company i found in the cheap juice realm so i have to include them as their flavors are top notch .
i liked their branding and the price was really good .
my only complaint is they advertise bogo '' everywhere but if you dont buy a separate bogo '' item and try to buy 2 of the same flavor you get charged 24.99 per 120ml .
still a good deal just felt like they were trying to trick unsuspecting customers .
a near perfect balance of strawberry and bananas that is definitely an adv for me .
pee wee kiwi i was n't ready for this one but i loved it .
it has a very strong watermelon flavor which you dont expect or at least i did n't since watermelon is normally very tame but i could n't put this one down .
hop scotch one of the best butterscotch flavors you will find .
good mix of toffee and vanilla but it 's definitely butterscotch !
i know there are more than these three so let 's hear in the comments what your favorite brands/flavors are .
if you have a well thought out review i will include them in the list .
i 'll be updating this list throughout the year !
it 's a standard up/over door few gaps around it pretty old .
the floor is also unfinished concrete which will be worked on in time but for now need something cheap to cover that door
solo asws probably wo n't get a crawl the same as ro .

with dale retiring there will no longer be a 88 flair selection for him so a classic flair must be created .
he already has a 8 so we need to add some 88s .
in the comments below choose three flairs from the image above https i.imgur.com/beslvof.png that you vote should be the classic 88 flair selections for dale earnhardt jr .
comment with the numbers next to the 3 flair images you are voting for in order of your favorite selections where the first number is the image you want to use the most .
i 'll use the data from the comments to choose which flairs we 'll use in the classic flairs section of the 2018 flair update .
please use this thread to discuss anything you 'd like !
i have no background in programming whatsoever but was always curious about it .
so after doing a lot of reading/watching of basic literature on programming python specifically for about a days worth i realized i had made the rookie mistake of not doing enough implementation of my own as i went along .
so despite me being super anxious about it i downloaded some python app on my phone and started coding .
took a lot of deleting and rewriting lines for my code to follow correct trails of logic before i even attempted to run it .
i did n't expect much when i ran it tbh expected lots of errors but somehow everything worked like it was meant to .
ever get that feeling of having 0 hopes for something but then finding it to be the most perfect thing ever ?
that 's how i feel right now about my baby code .
granted this probably is n't something that warrants this much pride and definitely not worth the post but i just ca n't help it haha .
any bits of code i can add or remove ?
my biggest concern was my ability to implement functions .
even during my readings and watching of videos i struggled most to grasp the concept of functions .
i think i finally understand them to a degree now but i could n't figure out how to use them in my code .
i did start off with them but eventually after failing to figure it out i just ditched it all together .
even though the 2016 new year just hit i still had no idea what i was in for .
my boyfriend of a year then and 16 months in the spring would leave in the middle of finals week .
summer came i stuck like glue to a guy who i met .
b '' was very pushy and at the time i was scared of being too much '' which ultimately led me to do many things i did not want to do or really consented to .
after he left for school his demeanor only worsened but i still felt attached .
i was beyond aware of how he manipulated and gas-lighted yet i thought i could be above it .
so when in comparison when i meet a guy who treats me normally and respectfully starts talking to me he seems perfect in my eyes .
that 's when i finally began a relationship again .
when things were on and off until the summer of 2017 due to things that were out of my hands mental illness it was finally over .
i felt crushed as i invested my all into one person and i helped them over so many hurdles just left .
it left me still thinking was i too much ? '' .
this fear and the fear of spending summer alone once again led me to talk to b '' once again .
i explained this to him and we spent summer together .
i have no idea if it was the weed klonopin or desperation but i felt like i grew very close to him .
i knew i exchanged a lot of myself to get this far giving into whatever he wanted essentially i was afraid of being too much '' so i became incredibly submissive .
he would always tell me how much he wanted a future with me even past the point where i thought it was too fast .
turns out that 's a bad way to handle things .
i failed to reach many personal goals i had for myself .
i still was close with b '' even at school and still talking to plenty of girls .
my sleep my plans my friends my money my time .
it was so bottled up and i just short-circuited .
i was planning to kill myself by new years .
i truly could not face that what i had been doing was a waste and no matter how i tried with everything people would always have it better than me .
if i gave up now i would never have a future with b '' .
i forced myself to do things and i took it past the point i could return from .
i do n't remember much of it because i was too doped up on klonopin but i did tell him multiple times that i wanted to be with him exclusively .
christmas eve i spent alone getting high and crying my eyes out .
i did n't know how bad things could get .
i talked to some guys in between but i never felt anything for them .
they would always end because i denied their advances to be a relationship .
i feel like i 'm probably trying to compensate to be with b '' subconsciously .
fast forward past new years i 'm on bed rest for a viral infection .
i had begun becoming more and more positive trying to accept my emotions even become progressive from it .
b '' has spent barely any time with me since my break barely even uses me either .
out of spite i 'm guessing since everytime we facetime he gaslights me and says that he 's the victim .
being on bed rest has led me to become severely depressed .
i feel like i 'm back at square one .
whenever a guy texts me that 's not b '' i 'm disappointed .
i hate to say it to because they are pretty nice i just ca n't force myself to even talk to them anymore .
i 'm trying to change my emotions the best i can .
even a relationship with b '' at this point is n't something i want .
i feel like me being in relationships is pathetic '' and cliche '' .
i do n't want a relationship with anyone anymore .
i feel like i just ran out of emotions for other people .
do n't get me wrong i feel like i love b '' to death but nothing can really fix the memories at this point .
i just want to catch up in my classes get my license get ready for college .
i want to quit my shitty fast food job to work at somewhere less toxic .
i want to be happy enough to create art and be motivated enough to do the simplest of tasks .

why we are doing solo/duo in ranked matchs instead of flex .
we are blaming our team mates salty players trolls afk 's etc .
and it affect 5-10 of our game win results .
playing with random 3-4 people is gamble.. low elo 's are far problamatic than plat .
2-3 people is known each other and probably they have communication .
2 smillar experienced sion player one of them doing only 100 matchs on flex and other one is only doing 100 matchs on duo both have 60 win 40 lose at the end of season .

hey guys im looking for friends to play lol again .
i have been playing for 5 years now i would say i am gold level .
last week i finally made the switch from my 2 years old iphone 6s ios 11.2.2 to the pixel 2 .
everything went nice and the transfert was smooth as i don´t use imessage or facetime and took my time to read what i should do .
overall it was ok. my first impressions were the screen is awesome and better than the 6s .
i had three apps that kept crashing ... facebook and twitter along others like amazon that were lagging .
and at my surprise the 6s with ios 11.2.2 supposed to be buggy kept on with the pixel 2 .
i´m not a hardcore user i just want to use the general apps everyday and call my family .
during the time of using the pixel 2 i found myself keeps sneaking to open the apps on the iphone .
i read alot about how great the pixel 2 is and it was compared even to the iphone x .
i´m thinking about returning it but maybe i´m doing something wrong and i don´t want to regret the decision later if i´m missing something with this phone .
hey guys i called freedom mobile support about potentially blocking this feature they have where they remind you how much you are being charged monthly .
unfortunately they claim they wo n't be able to turn this off or help out .
i have multiple lines for family members and i would prefer to just stop these messages coming in from freedom mobile in everyones phone some family members freak out over how much the bill is overall .
it 's an android phone if it helps looking for someway to block this off .
hey guys i just started playing jhin and i want to know what to build on jhin because ive been seeing different people building different things

pretty soon i think china will make enough of their own content and will no longer import korean media .
china started an unofficial ban on exported sk entertainment late 2016 .
it has only recently started to ease up a little .
china 's ministry of public security went as far as to caution the public about the dangers of watching s.korean dramas .
k-beauty will prob take a hit just from the loss of the chinese market .
south korea 's economy is being punished by china over the thaad row .
their automobile and tourism industries also took a big hit .
im not an ambassador and i do n't feel that it is n't fair..you took the initiative to complete the necessary steps and wait to become that title ... no shame there
was there ever a deal that had no chip but daca ?
every deal was chip and daca and one time a ridiculous wall .
we ordered delivery and it came fast and everything was packaged nicely in a reusable branded bag .
in some cases they simply write the character out of the show .
maggie roswell who used to voice maude flanders on the simpsons asked for a raise once and they responded by killing off the character with a t-shirt cannon and sacking her .
the geico gecko was originally voiced by kelsey grammer https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6qc1h2smk1s then they later switched to the current actor jake wood who does a completely different voice .
aside from that finding a new voice actor is trivial .
there are lots of actors out there who are versatile enough to closely imitate an earlier voice .

anything other than a fender-bender should be reported to your insurance company
anything more than a fender-bender and you should get a lawyer .
you should get checked out in the er lots of injuries do n't show up right away .
there are lots of things you should do that most people do n't because assholes like you tell them it 's ridiculous .
i agree with most of what you are saying the only thing i would say is debatable is his lyrical value and flow his first two albums and even some of graduation lyrically are about as good as it gets in terms of good cohesive story telling .
as for his flow the things he does with his voice bridging the gap between rapping and singing pop and rap are far ahead of their time .
i think that as he has come along in his career he has faltered lyrically as his focused has shifted more to fashion and family but his beats are still great if you listen to yeezus purely as instrumentals it 's phenomenal .
tlop is not as ambitious or ground breaking but still very polished and well done .
just cuz they fcked up does n't mean someone else will .
does n't hurt to lowball if u do n't want to pay a premium
i dunno to me chi chi seemed to react genuinely when thorgy came in ?
the cabals are informal factions and there are a lot of unaligned or eclectic archmages in the archcouncil .
the magocracy has just been theough 20 years of a radical heterodox dictatorship .
a coalition of civilians mages both orthodox and moderate heterodox prosecuted minorities and foreign powers managed to topple the regime through a revolution and this coalition placed the most senior magician a moderate heterodox as the current grand vizier but he 's too dependent on his allies to exert real power .
the previous prevalent current of heterodoxy was a radical near-communist tyranny while the current prevalency could be considered socdems or socmags i suppose .
although they were prominent orthodox mages who supported the toppled heterodox regime .
cabalistic matters are not the inly thing defining allegiance in magocratic politics other factors such as family ethnicity regional origin and personal goals are to be considered .
both cabals have varied their approaches over the years .
the fallen heterodox regime was militaristic and invaded the nesiotic league and republic as well as nomadic desert tribes prompting their intervention .
the current orthodox and moderate heterodox are fsr more cooperative as they relly on foreign funds to rebuild their nation .
it definitely more of a pain in the ass now .
if i do n't have my rocket immediately available damage will be done lol
i 'd argue their miscalculation happened in taking a more hands-off approach to ukraine 's future by losing the battle for soft influence with the west rather than their actions during 2013-2014 .
at that point they already knew they have lost ukraine for decades and it was in essence an asset-stripping '' and putting foot in the door '' kind of operation .
my first reaction was to wonder how much did they risk to capture that wealth
as far as i know variables are never automatically rounded by gamemaker .

do they literally disable the print screen key by ripping it off every single keyboard so nobody can do it w/o a phone ?
yes it 's just water and i found it so odd too .
and you 're right about using water in other ways that was something i had n't considered we often have to refer to water when brushing our teeth going in the ocean showering etc. and we certainly would n't be doing those with juice !
another point of confusion as far as i 'm concerned .
maybe oprah has a beetle but she also has a tesla and probably has a few others .
also side note i ment win a tourtnament with those 4 .
not beat them cause plup has already beaten all four but not win the tournament
commercial edm is on its way out as it is and your average edm fan could care less about purchasing music and/or sound quality .
i would recommend you start listening to house/techno as you can find almost all great releases on vinyl though many are decidedly difficult to acquire .
going back to 1980 all the way through today there 's a plethora of excellent electronic music available on wax .
as of now it looks like they 're only selling breez .
would you seriously categorize subnautica as an overall horror game or are you just referring to a couple big scary things that happen ?

look i do female photography and i work damned hard not to be a creeper and i will admit it 's hard .
as a guy any time i get a camera in my hand i feel the urge to take a picture of hot chick but the thing is i can also control my breathing not sweat profusely and kinda keep my shit in check so that i do n't convey the ultimate picture of a guy who is going to go home and knock his gong around the minute he gets that picture into photoshop ''
not that they 'd have sex with you anyways .
they would n't know what to do with a live penis .
i have not personally had sex with a cosplay girl but i have friends in the age group who have and the general consensus is that the girls respond to a cock in their hands in roughly the same fashion as they would if you were to hand them the throttle stick on a mig jet rocketing towards the ground and ordered them to pull out of an active tailspin namely confusion bordering on terror . ''
a few weeks back i was at the club and some girl is going off on what a nerd she is .
i had to point out that being a gamer is not the same as being a nerd but she just kinda looked at me as though i told her gravity was a liquid and it tasted like gummy bears .
great dumbass you think playing video games makes you an intellectual elite with a taste for high quality fantasy ?
lastly anime i got ta say it ... one thing you probably do n't realize is that anime is n't a brilliant art form .
you think it is because you have no frame of reference aside from flipping your shit in groups of 10 at the san rio store but it 's actually kinda crap in japan .
if you had ever been to japan you 'd know that pretty much everything in that place is accented with drawings so cute that they shit cartoon cats . ''
at any rate if you agree with this sentiment feel free to cross post it .
if you hate it and want me dead because i insulted you and your group of squeeling companion cube loving friends feel free to direct your friends here to give me what for seriously burst your hearts hot shell upon me .
i can imagine nothing better than a frothing group of cosplayers attempting to accost me at the next sci-fi convention with their giant tape swords and hand painted mavaricks with pressure gauges hot glued to them . ''
ayy good luck man but not too much luck cus you know..

we had a mountain lion on our hunting property as far south as ga. of course being the new guy i assumed they were screwing with me .
even producing game trail pictures i thought were found off the internet only when i searched myself several different ways and looking through hundreds if not thousands of images none of the pics matched any of the pics they showed me .
i played along anyway thinking they could have got them from anywhere .
two weeks after i am hunting in my climber and i hear something moving up the hill behind me ... sure as shit there was a mountain lion staring down into the ravine doing the same thing i was doing .
thankfully it moved on and i insisted a few of the guys come to get me to ensure i was n't alone .
one of the guys was a big time tracker ... he found several prints that belonged to the big cat .
one of the scariest days i have ever had .
since then i have been hunting the same property for 6 years .
no one says much about it except when sitting around the fire and drinking at night .

us driving laws are pathetic american drivers are uneducated and the accident rate per capita is fucking sky high and miles higher than somewhere like the uk .
american fatalities per 100,000 people is 14 uk is 5 world average is 15
also the uk is the 7th safest country to drive in even though our population density is crazily higher than most other places .
the us does not make the top 50 list of safest places to drive .

but fps loss and increasing heat arent good news .
it might not be dead now but it will probably happen soon .

let me tell you the story of mrs. x and i .
mrs x is a lovley elderly lady very nice very well dressed very well mannered .
she comes to me to check in asks me for help with her bag and when its settled i see its 27kg instead of the allowed 23kg .
so i tell her its too heavy and she will have to pay or leave stuff back .
so she says she has no hand baggage pointing at only a small purse in her hand and she is an elderly lady and its presents for kids the whole shabang .
so i waive the cost and she goes her merry way .
as fate has it i have the gate she travels on .
with a huge carry on bag thats way above the allowed 8 kg .
and yes i made her pay for the 4kg overweight and the second bag since her carry on was too heavy .
played me like a fool and used my good will .
and you really wan na know why we enforce rules ?
cause if we dont suddenly everybody is going to funerals weddings has made honest mistakes and so on .
and just rebook since its an honest mistake and people make those .
so there will be a post here or in some other travel forum saying hey airline xyz is rebooking me free of charge cause i said it was an honest mistake '' .
how long do you think does it take for people to jump on the free rebooking train by buying cheap tickets for times 3 months in advance then going to the airport and using the omg i made a mistake '' shtick to get transportaion on a date which would have cost them much more ?

master riku will be the judge of that ... sure you beat the evil clone team but how do you think you 'll fare against sage donald guardian goofy and king/master mickey ?
he 's using a saber card which mean his appearance/weapon will be that of king arthur .
so my point about that being arthur full armor set is still stands .

i believe this one i do n't believe there was more than one shooter but i believe there was more than one shooting and for some reason no one is talking about it .
sargon does a pretty good video that covers it but there were people at the hotels over 3 miles away recording shootings on their phone and the police scanner from the night shows that they were responding to shootings at multiple hotels .

pode citar uma análise mais apurada do motivo pelo qual o nazismo é de extrema direita ?
eu digo isso porque o nazismo '' é como chamamos o partido nacional socialista dos trabalhadores alemães que implantou um regime que previa a coletivização de bens privados e forte intervenção do estado na economia .
inclusive na questão da economia do mercado é raro ver alguém lembrar '' que era o governo alemão e não o proprietário privado nominal quem decidia naquele regime o que deveria ser produzido em qual quantidade por quais métodos e a quem seria distribuído bem como quais preços seriam cobrados e quais salários seriam pagos e quais dividendos ou outras rendas seria permitido ao proprietário privado nominal receber .

it is more about processed foods vs whole foods i think in terms of deciding what is healthy and what is not .
eating plain table sugar or drinking a glass of juice will spike your blood sugar faster than eating bananas .
this article does n't give any useful health information and it is really stupid to say sugar is bad '' and fat is good '' or vice versa .

let 's look at the top decks affinity would n't run it .
neither would elves gw company tron eldrazi tron burn humans storm maybe but they do n't run many fetches and remand would likely be their spell of choice living end dredge infect scapeshift and i could go on .
jeskai control/tempo would love it and grixis shadow prolly would stick with stubborn denial .
basically you have to look to a deck that wants to have uu on turn 2-3 .
jeskai and storm and again remand fits their plan better .

i think the problem lies with fear 's hero i believe he could do much more with different hero .
maybe give him some solid mid hero like sf and other heroes that could scale well in the late game .
the problem with eg is that they have 2 greedy carries in the game sumail and rtz .
even though sumail is playing as an offlane he requires so much farm compared to universe which mostly needs level only so their trying to give fear a less greedy pick cause its hard to win with a 3 greedy carry
in america you can absolutely drink at the beach .
you 're forgetting about the game planning that goes on before every snap .

look i 'm not going to argue on the purpose of technology but my personal belief is that technology should be pointed to tackling all basic services .
ideally members of society can spend those 8 hours a day working on projects that actually give them a sense of purpose and fulfillment .

those are n't scissors inside your ass are they ?
yeah you do n't agree with them and they do n't align with your viewpoints so everything they say must be invalid and just bs propaganda right ?

also you could just use a bit of leadtape inside if you want weight .
i think you 're right but still that 's the most dumb thing ever
i wanted to start tweeting back about stolen valor but i did n't think anybody else would think it was nearly as funny as i did .
so a scientist brought mispractice by fellow scientists to the attention of the public ?
i mean not that the other scientists were attempting to put misleading information into their report but it 's cool to see the checks and balances of modern science at work .
see this is why i dislike the practice of banning things on the grounds of it got overused '' .
just because some people use either gif or sound unimaginatively the people who might come up with something good risk getting their work taken down .
but at least the 11 small children had a neat pool raft for a few hours .
so they actually want you to leave tinder and go to their more profitable apps .

you 'll be surprised how the less better hand quickly adapts to things when the better hand goes numb .
so i just get 10 free fp summons after reset everyday and i do n't need to spend any fp ?
i read something about that but was n't sure if it was a jp version only thing .
also is there multiple reset times for like log-in bonuses and events or is there only one reset time ?
a redistribution would lead to less feel-bad situations after making the cut to top 8 .
depends strongly on the game obviously but i would prefer that the core mechanics map equally well onto everything .
what usually irks me is when all the skills in the game resolve the same way save one where rolling acrobatics and disguise and science use the same kind of roll but then hacking or sailing or charioteering is this elaborate extended thing with all of its own weird shenanigans when it really could just work like everything else .
of course the annoying pbta evangelical in me says your game should n't have ship combat unless it 's going to feature prominently and be a core mechanic ! but that 's me having an endless lust for hyper-narrow designs .
where people disagree is whether that amount has gotten too large .
controversial idea here no one is entited to the product or service or money of another .
i saw the worst article for people who work with general programming languages .
wanted to kinda learn js now i do n't wan na touch it with a 10 ft poll .
so the description of recover combo partners mp '' pretty much means infinite ss3 spam ! !
did he say he is n't back for stage 2 ?
it makes sense he would be eligible to play but he definitely will have to make up for all that practice time lost .
i have had that book for close to 10 years now but never got around to reading it .
it 's been one of the easiest investment reads for me except little book series .
if you are a long time investor you might not find anything new in it but its a good overview on lynch 's investment style .
edit also if you are starting with taleb i would recommend reading fooled by randomness first .
he considers his books as different chapters of the same core idea/philosophy beautifully explained in the beginning of antifragile .
that 's my personal opinion though many people consider that the order is irrelevant .
try doing some research on the movement if you do n't understand it .
your website made so much money that you just let it die ?
as for how 's that bitcoin doing ? ? ''
well considering that up still up almost 20k on an intital 18.5k investment its doing pretty awesome for me .
my btc returns are about 60 amazing for about 10 weeks
and litecoin is about the same rate of return or perhaps shightly better overall compared to eth
so to answer your question hows my btc and crypto investing going ?
and make a note i 'm betting it will hover around 11-12 for a bit but by end of february/march there will be another big increase in value personally i 'm actually hoping it will dip down to about 9k for a bit which will be another buying opportunity for me
but whatever the case unless something big happens i 'm just going to hodl until next november at least on to what i have to avoid short term capital gains tax rates on the profits i have seen already .
but either way i feel so happy to have gotten in when i did and i cant wait to see how much higher this can go .
of course youre just sitting on the sidelines now out of the game and not even a player anymore .
oh well ... . real btc investing is for big boys you just relax and play with your imaginary websites
are you talking about character creation in the livestreams ?
well the stick figure creation is just one of the methods you can use to create characters .
or you can choose to build it from ground up and then start coding the logic which would eventually lead to the stick figure first and then build your character specific animations there .
besides the characters in the campaign have really good quality animations as well from whatever i have seen .
but they have mentioned that they worked on the campaign for 2 weeks before showing it at psx so i expect the quality to improve closer to release .
when i was a kid i realized you could look straight at people 's faces and not be uncomfortable if you just slightly cross your eyes so you ca n't really see them .
i did n't realize this meant other people saw my eyes crossed ... until my parents took me to the doctor .
the scenario you describe is entirely different than saying they were recruited '' there .
however i think the article misleads the reader on several occasions .
by the way what have i said that does n't add up ? ''
i 'm simply doubting the validity of the details given my personal experience .
i 'm sorry but it was his job to calm down the players after such an emotionally taxing win .

funny how the automoderator asks to keep things civil yet the hate boner for the republicans and in some comments even religion flies with bright colors to no repercussion .

season 5 episode 13 episode 99 blame it on the bellboy 1992
join ian dylan and david for the 13th episode of season 5 where they review a film that really really tried to be one of those fun movies that are built wholly on misunderstandings .
the only problem is that those are hard to come by and this is n't one of them .
yes we watched 1992 's blame it on the bellboy '' starring dudley moore bryan brown patsy kensit richard griffiths andreas katsulas and featuring bronson pinchot as the titular bellboy .
this movie fails in a great many areas but the one thing this movie does not fail at is being an intricately crafted comedy of errors predicated on a mass misunderstanding it merely fails at being as good or entertaining comedy of errors predicated on a mass misunderstanding .
call me crazy but i think that it 's just a smidge important that the movie ends up either good or entertaining .
the darkest timeline is hosted by david ian and dylan on a weekly basis and ian dylan and someone else maybe david for a monthly podcast on patreon https www.patreon.com/dtlpodcast with a movie chosen by our patrons .
during a regular season they review bad movies and follow an actor from that movie to another one .
but during a themed season they simply pick a movie that falls within the theme .

i think how matchmaking works is the game uses the server closest to the quest leader and everyone connects to that .
as the game is developed in japan and actually has the largest following in japan i 'm pretty sure a server nearby you exists .
why the hell ca n't they put the tax-added price on the dang label ?
i would but i 've committed to reading multiple books on a daily basis in order to keep myself committed to the one-chapter-a-day thing .
a lot of people who say it 's much easier/addicting than they expected are reading the p v including myself but i wonder if that is true across most of the translations .
also it sounds like that new effect could be really good .
even if it 's only little mp restored it can still be good for very low mana cost units like princess sinon .
dear god i think we just collaborated on a new kdrama
yes he had 23 goals for fulham that season before spurs snapped him up in the summer .
calorie-wise they 're about equivalent when it comes to fullness for me .
that 's why i eat both bacon and broccoli but stay away from the bread pasta and rice .
i do n't think they will feel as involved if you are advancing the world without them my group thoroughly enjoys debating each scenario we undertake each event decision etc often leading to a dramatic coin flip when we are 2-2 on a decision ! .

a quick wikipedia/google search yields me something called radix economy '' and that e is the most economical choice of radix β 1 '' .
this is not something i want to practically use but rather to develop a realistic alternate system for a fictional race to use .
it would be great if i could be all fancy-pants and use e but i also want to be able to have some kind of grasp on it .
i could hardly get over the way it looked to try it the first time .
it 's not awful but i do prefer brown gravy .

for me i 'd say the anime has some serious pacing issues that can really detract from the experience in some arcs .
if you 're enjoying it so far definitely stick with it .
it 's a long investment sure but it means you 'll always have some more to watch !
if i were recommending anything i 'd say stick with the manga as it gets rid of the pacing issues but then you wo n't be able to see some of the best scenes animated unless you specifically watched those ones .
there 's also a fan project called one pace that 's fixing the pacing of the anime to better fit the manga but as far as i know it 's incomplete .

destiny should have just been that destiny no destiny with a 2 3 etc..
at this point there is no turning back d3 will be a thing .
but it should end there at least for some time .
restore all the content from d1 and d2 into d3 along side what is new in d3 .
improve d3 with dlc events updates etc.. from then forward .
if the current engine ca n't handle easy access of adding new tools and content use a different engine or build one .
update the engine like wow as its life cycle goes on .
yes i know this is way easier said then done and harder with consoles .
but being how consoles have upgraded versions eventually your gon na have to say sorry people but the next expac will be only on the xbox one x and ps4 or the w.e it is at the time .
obviously that will be at the point when most people have moved on to the newer consoles not right when the console launch a or your sells wo n't be very great .
graphics do n't make a game we played d1 for 3 years i never once complained about how it looked .
i 've got a few entertaining youtube channels i can link if you like .
you have the whole internet at your disposal and that 's why you 're a virgin .

in theory over a long enough time span all pools are equal .
irl some pools will do better than others but you ca n't determine that prior to results .
choose your pool based on features real time stats etc price fees lower is better and network robustness avoid joining the largest pool .

i used to live with a close friend who was a policeman .
he told me people telling the truth do it generally liars do it specifically .
the example he gave was when accused of killing lisapocalypse the murderer would say i did not kill lisapocalypse with a fork at midnight last tuesday !
whereas the person who did n't kill me would say i 've never killed anyone ! ! ! ! ! '' .

turkey pushed ahead with a ground offensive against kurdish forces in northwest syria in defiance of the u.s. to create what it called a security buffer along the border .
the move pits turkey against a u.s.-backed force that played a crucial role in defeating islamic state in syria .

sure it 's not lasting damage but it is still a sign of disrespect .
it wo n't stay there forever but you 're probably going to be pissed .

if she 's worried about you looking at kids that 's her problem .
you should n't need to convince her of anything .
i do n't remember hearing anything about flyquest practicing early or bootcamping so they 've had the same amount of practice as we 've had .
it 's bo1 on week one and though i was n't too concerned about the tl loss it 's worrying to see our lack of proactivity .
yeah this ended up removing the loop to read the characters into the array thank you
the jags played a hell of a game i wish bortles played that well consistently .
i approve though i would have loved to see his reaction when he could n't find you anywhere
i would n't cover it up just because i have chinese ancestry .
is it due to institutional power that discriminates native filipinos from getting rich ?
or a media that only markets light skinned asians and the least filipino looking asians ?
i would n't know because i never grew up in that society .
chinese filipino are also pretty kucked themselves from what i have heard .
probably one of the root cause of letting white worship entering filipino society .
i do n't know what is the solution but i welcome you to talk about it .
i gave the farmer 's market as an example .
there are literally hundreds of other places in los angeles worth visiting the next time you go to los angeles on vacation you really need to try them .
but and more importantly the comment i left elsewhere is more apropos
but here is where all this shit goes off the rails .
unless you 're retired or are independently wealthy or unless you have a job where you are guaranteed that you can work at home or you own your own business at some point you 're going to wind up switching jobs .
and when you do if you are in an area like los angeles you will either have to limit the geographic area of your search to an extremely small subset of the entire city at which point you may as well live in santa barbara or san luis obispo both of which are also extremely walkable .
or you 're going to have to acquire a car to get to work or you 're going to have to move .
not sure why you are being obnoxious but thanks anyway i guess .
i actually won the french filet beans in a give away raffle and i had no clue that they are special in that sense .
given it says 1cm wide i decided to wait longer .
size of seed does n't correlate to size of mature plant or size of the mature plant 's seed pod or fruit .
my point was i know the pod must grow wider than what it has done so as to accommodate the larger seed tis all .
i was confused as to why they do n't seem to be bulking up .
it can cause std 's or pregnancy or sometimes it 's consider abuse .
also there are such things as addictions to sex .
so like with most things you have to learn how to use it correctly .
raids doesnt require any teamwork and is plain and basic .
have you even completed 1 raid or have you just watched some on stream ?
youre pretty much the only person here who would disagree with me so i dont give a fuck you seem like a lost cause so go back to rs3
lol no lies saddam had wmd that 's how he gassed 200k kurds .
and there were 8 other un sanctions iraq was breaking .
and if lies were part of it all why not just fake a truckload of wmd to justify it to the world media ? ! ?
this expansion was alright other than the fact that it seemed like a firesale of old lore they slapped us with the emerald nightmare and then we destroyed the infinite legion without trouble .
what i feel they did right gameplay and mechanically with the game they really dropped the ball story wise .
tsm always gives people high opinions of bad players .
it 's a biological thing that has flown over the radar despite tsm 's amazing reignover the na lcs .

hey my friend invited me to this site and i was told that i get a free cat if that 's real how do i get it ?
i want to preface this by saying that i 've played all 3 games in the series and that i do not feel special in any kind of way .
a lot of people have done it and other crazier things looking at the yhorm torch guy .
the other day after getting stomped by gankers in my first few invasion attempts in this game i thought what could i try to make me feel even more depressed ?
i know getting to dark firelink at a low level ! '' .
getting ready for the boss fights dancer oceiros champion gundyr was actually the worst part of the run .
dark hand buckler crest shield cloranthy flynn lloyd 's shield ring estus ring and 11 estus 3 .
dancer took me around 10 tries and could pretty much oneshot me during second phase but i finally figured out all the different timings of her attacks .
i feel ashamed to say that i died more to her in my first playthrough than in this one .
i got insta cursed twice by his breath lunge attack .
a 100 phys shield trivializes him but since he 's got a ton of health and that i had to be extra careful because of his extremely dangerous charge attack the fight took me around 15 minutes .
champion gundyr however ... oh god what a fight .
i got completely annihilated for the first 10 or so tries after that i got down the parry timing for almost all attacks .
and then it happens parry after parry the champion is defeated .
in the end this was both a nightmare and a really fun experience but i ca n't even imagine what these bosses are like at sl 1 and/or without using dark hand .
although it did help me get a better hang of this game 's combat since i was used to ds2 's slower one .
and another thing parrying gundyr 's charge is one of the best feelings you can get in the series .
trading and sharing gear with others is too helpful .
if you want to play alone make a private game .
but between your solo questing for god 's sake man have a friend help with items !
even if your explaination is i just like sing '' no .
get on the realms and stop killing yourself looking for that one item or rune that a friend can give you for free .
no mither is a bad perk as of now the killer knows when someone has it and they never leave them on the ground .
so to fix that i have a few ideas .
spawn in uninjured but you ca n't go back to the uninjured state when you are hit .
do n't show the killer that the person has no mither
just these 2 things could make this perk a really good perk especially with tenacity and unbreakable .
i just woke up after two and a half hours of incredibly restless mind racing sleep and i feel great .
i have tons of energy and motivation like crazy .
for real though i do n't like being around others when i 'm like this because i scare them apparently .
i do n't want to end up back in the hospital this time .
is there really anything i can do aside from get a med adjustment and try to sleep well ?
hi im looking for some people to play with im getting bored soloing all the time !
so i 'm not completely familiar with all of the red pill theories and material but i 've done some research and it seems intuitive to me and is something i 've felt like i always agreed with .
originally this was because i was religious but i 've since left religion .
i 've wanted to have sex for so long but i wanted to find a proper alpha male to lose my virginity to and not just some random or beta male i 'd regret it with .
i 've joined some online chat groups recently and i met a guy .
he 's actually the one who introduced me to the red pill subreddits after talking to me and realising my vision on life and relationships is similar to the way trp works .
we clicked instantly i 'd say messaged very regularly almost daily .
we have a lot in common we 're on the same level of intelligence and we 've shared pictures .
we definitely have chemistry everyone else on the chat group has sensed it .
he told me that he has a very strong urge to sleep with me but also sees me as ltr material and would honestly date marry me with the only flaw being that we 're the same age so smv floats in my favour .
he 's saying we should meet up and do it sometime next month .
on one hand i feel like he 'd be the perfect person to lose my v-card to since he 's experienced and we click so well .
but on the other hand i 'm scared of losing my value '' and that i 'd regret it and i 'm worried that 1.5 months is a really short time before having sex esp for the first time .
but it feels like we 've known each other for ages and i trust him and i want him to be my captain so i do n't want to push him away by stalling and being weird about it and yet at the same time i 'm worried i 'm not making the right choice .
i 've told him that i do n't want to be another plate to be spun and thrown away and he told me not to worry and that he wo n't take advantage of that .
do you guys have any advice or tips you can offer me ?
im looking to trade my m9 fade 100 fade with 0,010 float .

i applied to the ucla bioscience graduate program specifically the immp concentration last fall and received positive feedback from the pis who i contacted .
since then i 've either been invited in for an interview or rejected by every other program to which i applied .
the lack of response from ucla has been making me more and more nervous and for some reason i ca n't find information on when their campus interview sessions have been in the past or when invitations will be sent out .
does anyone have information regarding either of these issues ?

often courts and commentators struggle to articulate why privacy is valuable .
privacy is a limit on government power as well as the power of private sector companies .
the more someone knows about us the more power they can have over us .
personal data is used to make very important decisions in our lives .
personal data can be used to affect our reputations and it can be used to influence our decisions and shape our behavior .
it can be used as a tool to exercise control over us .
and in the wrong hands personal data can be used to cause us great harm .
if a person has a reasonable desire to keep something private it is disrespectful to ignore that person 's wishes without a compelling reason to do so .
of course the desire for privacy can conflict with important values so privacy may not always win out in the balance .
sometimes people 's desires for privacy are just brushed aside because of a view that the harm in doing so is trivial .
even if this does n't cause major injury it demonstrates a lack of respect for that person .
in a sense it is saying i care about my interests but i do n't care about yours.
how we are judged by others affects our opportunities friendships and overall well-being .
although we ca n't have complete control over our reputations we must have some ability to protect our reputations from being unfairly harmed .
protecting reputation depends on protecting against not only falsehoods but also certain truths .
knowing private details about people 's lives does n't necessarily lead to more accurate judgment about people .
people judge badly they judge in haste they judge out of context they judge without hearing the whole story and they judge with hypocrisy .
privacy helps people protect themselves from these troublesome judgments .
we need places of solitude to retreat to places where we are free of the gaze of others in order to relax and feel at ease .
we also establish informational boundaries and we have an elaborate set of these boundaries for the many different relationships we have .
breaches of these boundaries can create awkward social situations and damage our relationships .
privacy is also helpful to reduce the social friction we encounter in life .
most people do n't want everybody to know everything about them – hence the phrase none of your business. and sometimes we do n't want to know everything about other people — hence the phrase too much information.
in relationships whether personal professional governmental or commercial we depend upon trusting the other party .
in professional relationships such as our relationships with doctors and lawyers this trust is key to maintaining candor in the relationship .
likewise we trust other people we interact with as well as the companies we do business with .
when trust is breached in one relationship that could make us more reluctant to trust in other relationships .
personal data is essential to so many decisions made about us from whether we get a loan a license or a job to our personal and professional reputations .
personal data is used to determine whether we are investigated by the government or searched at the airport or denied the ability to fly .
indeed personal data affects nearly everything including what messages and content we see on the internet .
without having knowledge of what data is being used how it is being used the ability to correct and amend it we are virtually helpless in today 's world .
moreover we are helpless without the ability to have a say in how our data is used or the ability to object and have legitimate grievances be heard when data uses can harm us .
one of the hallmarks of freedom is having autonomy and control over our lives and we ca n't have that if so many important decisions about us are being made in secret without our awareness or participation .
a watchful eye over everything we read or watch can chill us from exploring ideas outside the mainstream .
privacy is also key to protecting speaking unpopular messages .
we may want to criticize people we know to others yet not share that criticism with the world .
a person might want to explore ideas that their family or friends or colleagues dislike .
privacy helps protect our ability to associate with other people and engage in political activity .
a key component of freedom of political association is the ability to do so with privacy if one chooses .
we protect privacy at the ballot because of the concern that failing to do so would chill people 's voting their true conscience .
privacy of the associations and activities that lead up to going to the voting booth matters as well because this is how we form and discuss our political beliefs .
the watchful eye can disrupt and unduly influence these activities .
many people are not static they change and grow throughout their lives .
there is a great value in the ability to have a second chance to be able to move beyond a mistake to be able to reinvent oneself .
it allows people to grow and mature without being shackled with all the foolish things they might have done in the past .
certainly not all misdeeds should be shielded but some should be because we want to encourage and facilitate growth and improvement .
an important reason why privacy matters is not having to explain or justify oneself .
we may do a lot of things which if judged from afar by others lacking complete knowledge or understanding may seem odd or embarrassing or worse .
it can be a heavy burden if we constantly have to wonder how everything we do will be perceived by others and have to be at the ready to explain .
which tanks do you think are in serious need of buffs to make it competitive again .
tiger 2 has been overshadowed completely by new ht 's .
i am unable to play it as a frontline heavy or as a support tank.i really liked e-75 and e-100 in the test server but tiger 2 hinders my progression .
except the gun it is worst in all other departments .
wg should also remove pref mm for is-6 kv-5 and other heavies .
give them guns which has 210mm pen as people have bought it with real money .
years ago when i was in my 20s i 'm in my 30s now i used to have reoccurring dreams with this beautiful girl .
in the dreams we 'd just be hanging out and going to random places together every day stuff like getting food or taking road trips .
to clarify the dreams were ultra realistic and i 'd often wake up feeling like i had been somewhere else to the point where i 'd question which one was my reality .
maybe this is n't a typical glitch '' but i felt it was sort of relative .
the thing that always struck me as odd is i 'm fairly certain i never met saw her and often wondered if she actually exists somewhere in this world or possibly another dimension universe reality ?
in my own personal beliefs i do n't think the human mind can imagine '' or create '' a person so that was always in the back of my head .
i still clearly remember the last time i had a dream with her in it it was probably 5-6 years ago .
in this one we were in a big city i could n't identify by looks and were searching for a particular building .
basically we ended up finally finding the place and she gave me a big hug kiss and told me i have to go now maybe i 'll see you again some day . ''
i can recall waking up and actually being sort of bummed out because i kind of knew that was the last time i 'd see her and it was .
hey guys i m fairly new to the game rly loving it so far but coming from much more active '' games the lack of new content kinda bugs me so far i only saw the introduction of the new first order char and nothing else i have a lot to do right now so not rly complaining as i need to build a roster from scratch but an event running or some kind of catch up updating would be cool .
is just a stale moment or is always like this ?
hey i 've got about 50-60 games under my belt looking for some other players who love this game as much as i do in the orange county area .
la or north san diego county is fine too .
i got a couple players near me with varying degrees of experience .
i do n't claim to be anything special but i 'm no novice .
pm me or respond here if you 're interested in gaming .
i 've met two gamers here on reddit so far and they 've been terrific additions to my gamer circle .
however somebody that she knew through online friends thought it is a good idea to find her facebook through her steam username .
she 'unfriended ' him as hes an asshole anyways .
he tried to be friends again at around mid dec and she said no .
and now she is worrying because she didnt know if he wants revenge on the rejection .
she imagined that if he wants revenge he would make up fake chat history about illegal stuff and report to the police .
i know the eagles will try their best but in the back of every player and coach 's mind has to be that pressure that being up even by 20 in the 4th is not gon na be a comfortable lead .
i feel like the win last year could play a mental aspect in the game and make them force a few throws they shouldnt or make a really aggressive play call in their own territory knowing they can never let up off the gas .
imagine knowing that there is no such thing as being comfortable against bb and the pats
having known each other for years hell probably even longer then that we both have some stuff we can definitively say about each other .
whether it be personal or private we know almost everything about each other .
and one those things is very clear to us we are both 100 straight no ifs or ands or buts about it .
we 've helped each other get girlfriends we 've discussed our sex lives our favourite porn stars even given each other tips on how to make sex better for us .
we have no shame and while some people have found it weird to us it 's normal to the point were it 's become almost like small talk when needed of course .
but especially recently we have both been starved for sex .
and with both of us being roommates when we do bring girls home it 's hard to really do what we wan na do in fear of getting caught or making too much noise .
so one of us came up with a silly idea one that might just work while still preserving our love of women watching each other masturbate .
we wo n't even have to touch each other just a way for both of us to get our fill and also have a sexual encounter '' in a way while not also being you know gay .
i am thinking of buying a raspberry pi to mine garlicoin and i was just wondering if a certain type had a better cpu or something

ich suche fleißige texter die ab und an mal geschäfftlich für mich texte schreiben möchte .
i 've spent some time trying to figure out what happened to timothy gentry the sibling of one of my scottish ancestors see here https www.reddit.com/r/genealogy/comments/72srlz/looking_for_my_gggguncle_timothy_gentry_b_1825_in for an earlier post .
in that time i found that he became a miner in california where he settled in butte county then yuba county .
in 1881 timothy was granted a patent for a quarter of a section https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_land_survey_system survey_design_and_execution of land in butte county by the bureau of land management record here https glorecords.blm.gov/details/patent/default.aspx ? accession=cacaaa 20040728 docclass=ser sid=yxwixqrt.yxe .
i figure that since california did n't keep statewide death records until the 20th century and butte and yuba do n't seem to have newspapers digitized for this precise time period i do n't have a great way of determining when timothy died .
he does n't seem to have a probate file in either county .
however if i can figure out what happened to timothy 's land it may provide a clue as to when he died .
does anybody have any ideas how i would go about tracing the ownership of a parcel of land if all i know is its geographic location ?
or maybe somebody has another idea about how i would go searching for some record of timothy ?
i have a battery in the mail but i rather not be phoneless for x amount of time if i screw up .

this is some advice from a d1 day 1 player who has stuck through the high 's and low 's of the destiny franchise over the past 4-ish years .
this sub has enough hypocrites who cried like babies all through-out d1 about various things in both pve and pvp only to cry more in d2 then all of a sudden just pretend like they 've always routed for d1 as if it 's some perfect game .
let me just remind people not to listen to all these people who ca n't even keep a straight opinion about the franchise and their minds sway around from one end to another like little girls in their terrible two 's .
sure d2 has a lot of issues but do n't forget it 's only been out for 4 months and there 's going to be plenty of things coming in the future to fix these issues .
d1 has been out nine times as long i.e .
about 36 months and it still was n't close to perfect with a lot of people whining about it at the time .
d1 ended up with some of the worst meta in pvp like no-skill 1-shotting sticky nades that literally curved around corners people who never used their primary and just ran around crouching hiding going invisible around corners with sidearms that killed faster and more reliably than any handcannon in the game non-existent skill gap with people able to spam powerful grenades/abilities every 30-40 seconds .
snipers were useless because of the whiners who kept running into the most obvious sniping lanes like headless chickens .
ugh everybody on dtg complained about these things at the time .
while pve was improved by the live team over the years everybody still constantly complained about long content droughts and nothing to go after especially when a lot of the sought-after weapons or items hello wotm ship were locked behind total rng that most people could never obtain even after thousands of hours put into the game .
and for people who play d2 on pc returning to d1 only means being forced to go back to that abysmal 30 fps on consoles with slow loading times and slower clanky movement .
that in itself is enough reason not to play d1 if you 're on pc .
never again will i touch a 30 fps shooter after playing d2 on pc in 3440x1440 ultrawide at 120 fps and g-sync .
last but not least d1 is simply an old game .
it 's 3 years old now and its content has been played to death by most people unless you 're new to destiny completely .
i 'm definitely not going to be playing all these old raids that i 've completed 100 times each already .
i 'm definitely not going to be playing all these old strikes and pvp maps that i 've spent thousands of hours playing already .
hope my 2c helps the non-hypocrites out there in not being swayed by all the idiotic posts we see lately on this sub about d1 this and that .
d1 is being overrated by all these heart broken kids who ca n't seem to get over an old game in year 2018 .
i 'm not saying that d2 is the best and people should continue to play this game but going back to d1 is definitely not the answer .
if you 're not enjoying d2 then go play other games out of the destiny franchise and return to d2 once more improvements are made over the next few years .
good luck folks and let 's hope dtg will become a better sub rid of all these heart-broken hypo 's who ca n't get over a 3 year old game instead of looking to the future of the destiny franchise .
so i 'm half way through the second to last book in the wheel of time .
let me start by saying i 've never been more emotionally involved in a book than i am in this series .
that said is it just me ... or is the entire premise of the game of thrones series just some books about daes dae'mar ?
even the title game of thrones game of houses ?
you can even compare houses to countries and see striking similarities .
tl dr game of thrones ' entire premise for the books is based off a single aspect of the wheel of time .
i 'm curious as i 'm looking into creating base ban functionality in a unity game i 'm developing .

if you want to sell on an amazon listing but the current listing is out of stock '' for say a certain variation how can you list on the asin .
normally i just click the sell on amazon '' button to the side but when something is sold out it wo n't allow you to view that asin 's page until more stock comes in .
yesterday i was in aldi in houston and i realized the salmon fillet i always buy has a note on the package that says added sodium_triphosphate ''
they soak salmon fillet in this chemical so that the meat does not dissolve and stay intact .
also fda does not require companies to disclose it .
companies do not treat whole fish with sodium_triphosphate because this chemical does not penetrate the fish skin .
but it is not easy to find wild caught tasty fish cheap they are all expensive .
so i am in the search for wild caught salmon fillet without sodium_triphosphate in houston .
the salmon fillet on display in grocery stores and wholefoods does not have a label on them .
the clerks have no idea when you mention this issue so do n't bother
so i looked at the frozen section in wholefoods but none of them has a label for it .
anybody in houston have thoughts experiences on this matter ?

i know we got pacific rim but thats it we have n't really gotten anything else and it just seems like an obvious thing to do .
we are definitely there cgi wise and having humans in cockpits with cgi mechs seems like an easy thing compared to having a superhero look good .
and story wise there is alot you can do personally i 'm enjoying the fuck out of iron blooded orphans season 2 and it just makes me wonder why there are n't more mecha live action movies ?
after years of hearing both critics and fans praise the resident evil games i finally decided to try out the first game .
picked up the pc version of the re-make picked jill the hardest mode available from the start tough yet rewarding i think and jumped right in .
for playability 's sake i chose the modified movement system .
i do n't mind tank controls but was n't feeling up to it on my first run .
when i try out chris 's story i might give it a go .
i 've never really been big into horror games i think too many of them rely on jumpscares and fail to create a good atmosphere .
re-make startled me in a few places but what it did exceptionally was tension and dread .
the limited saves crimson head enemies and back-tracky level design with a few one way doors created some really tense moments as i struggled to find a safe room knowing any careless death would cost me progress .
i 'm the kind of guy who saves all the time when i play games so having to manage my ink ribbons really had me thinking tactically .
weighing the possible risks of charging ahead to preserve my precious save tokens .
not super simple but complicated enough to require a bit of critical thinking in places .
thankfully there was n't too much dumb adventure game logic and i often found myself overthinking puzzles instead of trying to put something together without all the pieces .
the mansion was satisfying to explore plenty of shortcuts and alternate routes .
i opted to keep a handful of the zombies alive so that i could save ammo and be safe from crimsonheads later in the game .
bosses were a bit easy but i horded grenade launcher ammo and only used it on bosses so they all went down pretty quick .
the dialogue was n't as campy as the clips of the ps1 version i 'd heard but was still pretty campy and i appreciated that .
the master of unlocking '' line was one i wish had made it to the remake though .
was surprised as to how much interesting flavor text there was .
i kind of expected a straightforward dumb zombie game story but the diaries logs and papers hinted at all kinds of interesting conspiracies and tragic stories .
the game looked pretty good aside from a few weird things like the aspect ratio not being widescreen on the menus and a few of the cutscenes looking a bit off .
not sure if it was some sort of filter but the outdoor cutscenes all looked kind of blurry .
quite nice being able to play at 60-fps though .
probably on the fringes of my favorites list maybe around top 25 .
certainly going to revisit this again and play chris 's side of the story .
i might try for some of the speedrun achievements too .
i think the 5 hour one is pretty doable seeing as it only took me about 7 and a half on my first run .
i 've got to finish out some of the stuff on my 2016-2017 backlog nier automata is next but i 'm very curious about resident evil 4 now seeing as it set a lot of modern action game standards .
if there are any big re fans here which other games in the series are worth trying besides 1 4 and 7 ?
let 's hypothetically say my portfolio is worth 100 btc .
also hypothetically my friend wants to buy in to it .
a year later i double my portfolio and i also decide to put in another 10 btc .
how much has my friend earned off their initial 1 btc ?
how do i calculate this while taking in to account the unnatural growth of me putting in 10 btc a year later .
i ca n't simply get the ratio of 1:100 and multiply it by the growth of my portfolio to get their return since my portfolio grew by 10 unnaturally but my friend should not get a cut of it .
would i subtract their return by my deposits growth ?
portfolio grew from 101 btc to 424 btc in 2 years when they want to withdraw .
the single 10 btc deposit grew by 424/202 21 .
to get their return would i take my current portfolio value 424 and subtract it by my deposit with growth of 21 so 403 .
how would i do this easily with many deposits ?
i mean how do you forget scars when they 're visible to everyone mental/emotionally ?
i 'm trying to remember the name of an anime in the isekai genre unfortunately the only thing i can remember is a scene in the beginning where the main character is drawing a big magic diagram on the ground in his schools sports field or something and he uses that to activate a magic that transports him to another world .
kinda similar to the beginning of the light/web novel return of the former hero .
i have been quite for a while and looking for a new friend to talk to for fun .
whereas thousands of emergency teaching certificates are in use in sacagawea .
whereas thousands of alternative and or emergency certifications are given each year .

b this course must provide information of a standard educational degree but may leave off minor details so as to fit the course into six weeks .
c the individual wishing to complete the course must pass with at least an overall score of 75

a if any part of this bill be struck down or amended the rest shall remain active
a this bill will come into effect 1 year after signing .
this bill was authored by u/silverbearclaw for the state assembly of sacagawea .

his name is ace and his owner was conned out of giving him to someone who said they would provide veterinary care .

seeing as how the top choices for the choose your legends events have higher bsts and come with more skills than those who come second it occurred to me that the winners of this round will probably end up being stronger than brave roy and brave lucina .
i understand that this would be hard to avoid but it is a little odd when you think about how the winners of this round are essentially the third most popular heroes and will likely outdo the second most popular ones .
of course with the advent of powercreep by the times these new cyl heroes come out they might even be better than brave ike and brave lyn .

i 've been on board since bf1942 and i disagree with you .
it 's nowhere near as complex as arma squad rising storm or dcs a-10c warthog when it comes to aviation .
however the thing i believe to have noticed is that the community has changed with every new battlefield game .
people care less and less about orders and objectives which indeed makes it feel like a call of duty game with bigger maps .
i get your rant op but i do n't think the game itself is the culprit .

or maybe because it was working the same way on bfront 1 ?
i cook all dinners and almost all weekends lunch and dinners .
to be honest most of the things i cook at least those for myself have very few ingredients say steamed vegetables with a little of olive oil or a little of butter .
in any case i have a passion for numbers and math so logging is not a problem .
i add the recipes i use most often in mfp .
unfortunately it seems that i can only indicate integer servings '' in the results of a recipe .
since i like to weight precisely what i eat i use 10g as a serving .
since they are negligible i do not log spices .
example i did cook a simplified chicken tikka masala be patient i 'm italian .
i created in mfp a recipe with 120g of onion 50g of cream 400g of tomato sauce 11g of olive oil 150g of greek yoghurt 1050g of chicken breast .
i did not log the spices ginger garam masala cumin fenugreek paprika turmeric etc .
nor the garlic nor the half of a lime juice very little amount .
i weight the finished food and it is about 1220g so i enter 1220/10 122 as the number of servings '' .
when i eat say 250g of the cooked thing i log 250/10 25 servings '' .
if i do this recipe again i either follow exactly the amounts i 've used in the recorded recipe or i simply modify the recipe changing the amounts but i can leave intact the list of ingredients and the resulting number of servings .
sometimes i follow my own recipe to use more or less the same proportion of ingredients but i do not change the recipe nor do i weight the cooked results i simply know that if i have used more or less the same proportion of ingredients my dish has more or less the same calories per serving '' .
so first of all you can ignore the spices and in general all the ingredients that have little calories and are used in tiny amounts in my case the lime juice in the marinade .
then if you have a lot of different vegetables and you do not want to log them one by one you can look up the most caloric one i do n't know right away say the carrot just for the sake of the example and weight everything like celery onion carrot bell pepper together and log it as if it were all carrots .
i dont remember the gunk but i do remember the little ball .
just thought it was such cool technology when i was young .
true just change the fluff to fit better with the price and existing lore .
now i 'm 35 and have to account for every calorie i consume .
i have a friend that posts like that and we all look at each other trying to figure out who he 's mad at .
if it helps to share we 're here to listen ... you amazing person

you 're saying the actions you 'd take with the knowledge of realizing your future is already decided
there 's no being deciding such fate unless you believe there 's a supreme being conducting our actions in such case knowing your future would be just part of his/her/its masterplan and further discussion would be futile as it surpass us all .
the rest is exactly what i 'm trying to say the future you would know would include your actions decided already under the fact you already know your future .
knowing the future does change '' your future in comparison to the future you would get if you did n't know it as all decisions and actions you make are to be executed under the premise of you knowing your future accepting it and following it .
once you see your future all you decide to do will inevitably have your future as outcome as your future already has your knowledge of it as well as your resulting decisions and actions in itself .
in one point you either accept and execute your future free will or your future forces you to be such without your decision no free will .

believe me this is snippet nothing special for the book .
the blade in general on rbz sticks i 've yet to hear a good thing about an rbz stick from anyone who 's opinion i respect that and the ribcor thing i 've had a reckoner let 's not act like that helps the stick at all
these guys embody everything that this team is about .
however do think that they have to be playing in order to be contributing is inane thinking .
these guys contribute as much now as they did when they played .
just got my ledger blue after abt a month of waiting it was worth the wait .
the game is fun and has a great concept but it needs a little shine bug fixing experienced disappearing weapons crashes and random disconnects .
hopefully development is ongoing so i can justify the purchase next sale whatever price point they set .
i just watched a rerun where alex asked for more information when the contestant responded with blindness '' when color blindness '' was needed .
i think they look much better personally and i hear they 're also significantly easier to look out of .
just watch episode 1 of blend s should improve your mood .
one of the first words in the opening is smile xd
if you find any technical documents give those to proctor quinlan .
oh and i named my scooter servo bc she had servo 's coloring
why do you negatively reinforce your attributes instead of happily enforcing the evolution of those skills ?
but in that scenario the player has possession of the ball at the time of the contact .
a better comparison would be if the a db and wr get their feet tangled the receiver stumbles and falls 2 yards away from the db but then still catches the ball on the ground .
in fact i believe something like this happened in a vikings vs packers mnf game years ago and was allowed as a td .
i 'm not that into calendars but i 'm fairly sure there 's only 12 months .
what 's even the point of not giving him superpowers if you 're just going to give him superpowers and hand-wave it as ancient technique '' taught to him by a shaman/samurai/mongolian throat singer ?
the camera work on those stunners tho.. lord i hate kevin dunn
technically it means small but i 'd use it as filler in a sentence the whole time .
i wan na be your friend since i 've seen your spectacular fat tits !
that 's not how life works and it 's not how i think .
it 's frightening how high back lauri cocks the ball on some of these dunks
she 's actually german lol the fuck and even from eastern germany .
nudity is n't frowned upon nearly as badly as in america for most of europe too but this is still crazy xd
hand of emrakul exists to be cheated in on turn 3 or 4 through its own alternate cast .

lurk for awhile before you try any of it though .
for some of it slaves get paid better and for some it 's a straight-up scam .
i was very drunk and decided it was a great idea to take all the half empty beers and set up an amazing game of flip cup for an entire party ... realized near the end a bunch of the cans had cigarette butts in them and also i had distributed a red bull ... i convinced the entire party to play this game and drink all of this ... no one said anything ... .
you claim to be a disarmer thats good you 're fighting the good fight helping us actually reach towards disarmament and ultimately chapter 3 .
tell me because he 's actually done quite the opposite on multiple occasions .
very often he 's claimed disarming is pointless and that we should all invest in his insanity .
worthy psa but this pic was obviously taken from the glass floor extension in the calgary tower .
so not a single mention of the fact the lions are currently a more talented team ?
really do n't see anyone other than kane sterling and stones being considered 'world class ' and even then sterling and stones have go to keep their current form for another couple years
lol its not so bad just a couple swabs .
the super full bladder being pressed on will distract you .
if he only knew what vegeta was in a previous life
i agree that this is very likely as huni has that history on immortals .
i see it as slightly different and i see this roster as far more talented as that immortals team .
but yeah i 'm making bold claims and you 're most likely going to be correct .
also people who fantasise about minimum wage employees getting instafired for not perfectly following their special cause are basically presenting their credentials as spoilt little cunts who have never done a day 's work and are unlikely to be equipped to do so for the foreseeable future .
is the plan to put pellets one cup at a time into a woefully undersized hopper ?
i like the idea of pellets but i 'm not going to do that .
it seems like a certain amount of complexity is avoided by extruding to a spool or right into the feeder .
hate to be that guy but that 's not a switchblade .
i learned the same lesson busting the floor under the crate .
do n't see why not but might want to wait till you actually get the shoes no ?
i 'm surprised no one has said this yet but as someone who loved camila way before havana i have always loved her personality .
she has always been so humble and hardworking ever since 5h and xfactor days and that 's what made me a fan of her .
and then fast forward to 5h live shows where she literally was the only one who can sing live hit the notes without sounding out of breath and add her trademark adlibs and notechanges that made her parts of the songs more irresisitable to listen to it was clear that she was born to be a star .
then now in all her solo endeavours she has always been so hands on and never does the same performance twice that 's when talent meets hardwork .
tl dr her personality creativity and hardwork altogether are things that 95 of pop girls today do not have .
i 'm curious of what the actual arguments were in court .
im curious to see what they come up with .
i do n't think so i did n't use the regular torch
god damn it dude it does n't matter because i did n't see it .
if i see a motorist do something i can get their plate .
if i see a cyclist do something i ca n't yet we are both driving vehicles on the road .

yup we have a couple and we have found that if you have a cheap dimmer they flicker horribly a higher quality dimmer makes the flicker ... less of a problem .
my dm said we 're legally required to do one .
any more is up to you but 15 is obviously a sketch amount .
especially if they 're all the same amount i 'm assuming 10 .
personally i do 2 cause i 've had people get aggressive .
you can always lie and say you 're running out of cash .
or casually mention your dm cause that scares the scammers at my store .
it really is annoying but i do n't know how to stop it
the subfloor is still in plus an 1/8 '' laminate tile of some sort ... we were worried the tiles were asbestos and i just did n't want to deal with tearing up asbestos at this time..
the demo was going to cost 500 and many additional costs regarding tearing up asbestos tile .
plus i had a whole crew of painters in there all day so another reason i could n't deal with tearing up the tiles in case they are asbestos .
all this being said i think it was a poor choice on my end to forego demoing out the subfloor and original tile ...
this looks pretty atrocious to me and not i 'm facing this big problem solving issue..
i 'm going to have to get creative on this one.. ca n't really afford to tear it all up and start over .
i do n't care either way but what exactly can hogan offer at this point ?

no sir/madam..always been the same as far as i am aware..and i had the same one on another site for many years and i know the origin/reason for it so quite certain it hasnt been edited in any way ... what conversation did we have ?
you marry someone because you love them and have learned enough about them to know that they are a match for you .
3 years is more than enough time to get to know them well enough to know if they are a a good person and b a good match for you .
anything beyond that is a waste of time if marriage is your goal .
if you have not decided that you want to spend the rest of your life with this person by year 3 they are n't the one .
i consider 3 years the cutoff point the shit or get off the pot '' point .
along the way you are constantly reassessing and it can be ended if there is clear signs they are n't good people or a good match .
but it should never be decided to marry earlier than that 2-3 year point .
that time frame is plenty of time to get to know a person .
and people do not significantly change at their core barring traumatic event/injury or sudden drug addiction .
most relationships that go past that point are n't serious .
if a man is serious he 's making a commitment to locking this woman down .
if a woman is serious she 's looking for this commitment by this point or she 's moving on .
what 's caused all the murky water on this seriousness is the sheer amount of easy women who are playing shack-up honey and unpaid whore .
thinking it 's just like being married '' when it is n't even close .
when someone says that i always ask them if it were then why not just get the marriage certificate then since it provides many legal benefits ? ''
because it 's not the same thing at all .
something about walking down the aisle and taking sacred vows in front of man and god is serious business entirely unlike playing shack-up and being able to keep one leg out the door .
there 's no serious commitment from the man and she 's handing out the milk for free .
games that have a environment clock synced to your actual time and day .
the problem is n't really that there is not enough cover in the overall maps but in certain game modes conquest assault there is not enough cover for certain teams starting off resulting in a unfair and unfun balance .

while here we just have one full valentine 's day where we just basically trade gifts at once valentine 's day over there is cut inn half with a one-month difference

now i 'm going to ask you do something you may have never done before it will push you to your limits and it might be scary but i have faith in you .
the bishop in question has never been caused of abuse .
a while ago there was a priest who was an abuser the courts in chile did not convict him but the church did so he is not a priests anymore .
now the victims of him are claiming that the local bishop knew about this from before hand and did not do enough .
there is no evidence to support this they have nothing to go on but their own intuition .
they have pointed to no witnesses and none of his action suggest he knew anything .
they wanted the pope to intervene and make the bishop resign .
the pope did say he would consider it if they brought evidence .
campaign wise i 'd say chaos since they have no challenge and are too boring for me to play .

malay islam was doing fine under british rule that 's the ironic part
i do n't think it 's ironic given that the sultan 's only job at that time was to handle religious affairs thanks to british handling most of the other administrative tasks .
got ta let the sultans feel like he is still important otherwise they 'll start riling up the masses again .
exactly ... been saying it that amd can take a limited number of bets in their current situation .
so they chose to take the long term bets like 7nm instead of trying to make money short term by going all in gpu production that could backfire at any moment .
i got most of the way through ended up dropping it right before a certain infamous library related scene which i ended up spoiling for myself by accident
not that that worries me i read worm for the first time after reading taylor 's wiki page .
did n't know the hydration on ciabatta was so high .
figured there was n't much difference on the pizza dough/bread dough thing based on this experience .
was just really surprised it turned out so good .
to say i got every signature from the bottom team of the 2017/18 season sounds pretty good in a couple of years
you 're just doubling down on dumb because you refuse to change your opinion despite new evidence .
you 're just being defensive and refusing to admit you are wrong .
second most intelligent people learn that being polite and pleasant is more important than being right '' when they 're about 12 years old .
seems you 've missed some important steps in social development .
third i have no interest in reading your post history as i assume it 's just as tone-deaf and nasty as the comments here .
and if you think my comments here count as nasty you 're in for a rude awakening when you leave the safety of this star trek sub and venture out into the real world .
almost everything is online and free certain translators insert their own bias but for the most part are pretty good
except that 's because people were driven out by white black and asian crime and it unfortunately meant that it is easier to leave as a white person .
because no one would rent to us where we currently live .
they would remain in market for months after though .
not that a i know of she dropped out midway through so eh
malzahar is your one-way ticket to climbing almost guaranteed in my opinion .
no hard mechanical skill involved really you just need to know good times to roam and how to use your time effectively once the wave is pushed in .
careful though because i 'd wager the dude has a swift death coming in some patches time .
i was watching it on youtube and someone commented that they thought jon had died when he closed his eyes .
then someone said they started screaming because they thought he had died just like that .
gave me a chuckle which is something at least because like you said it was cringey as hell .
and i loved loved loved jon prior to this season
i would if they were logic and had a scientific justification 😀
goddamnit it 's too late for me to use this but this is the only thing in here that makes sense to me !
i mean after how much of a shit show the last major was with the seedings/matchups and stuff its sort of expected that alot of the smaller teams would n't make it

who do n't share a very similar culture and religion
how modern until very recently we all did n't think europe had similar culture and religion .
we changed the rules you ca n't blame them for that .
we do n't want temporary refugees so we make the process hard so they either stay or leave early .
yeah because the numbers to day are much much much smaller so it 's just a tiny thing .
germany and sweden took more than their share and had 1.5-2.5 migrants
true because many in europe find 0.5 too much of an effort after having helped destroy iraq and cause this chaos .

this article represents clean energy producers not solar panel manufacturers directly .
they have to subsidize clean energy producers as the energy is not yet cheap or practical enough which is fine its their money their country .
however they sold panels cheaply enough to put our manufacturers out of business .
they 'd need less subsidies if they sold their panels at least at cost not at a net loss to the country .

do you do those as man to woman interactions or is it more person to person ie which way to the post office sir ? ''
as opposed to hi i 'm abri56 what 's your name ?
day to day is less effective because those are typically normal predictable moments of comfort and familiarity .
whereas moments of nuance can be amplified and more effectively heighten polarity .
it 's about playing to the strength of the moment .
in a day to day style moment it might be better to build trust intimacy non sexual subtext and moments of elevated states allow some section of uncertainty to heighten anxiety which typically a man enjoys converting into passion purpose and certainty particularly in sexual persuits .
i will say this one thing that is unendingly invigorating to me anyway as far as non chalant day to day things are done cooking cleaning watching tv together hanging out on the couch skin exposure .
i dated a girl who just liked cleaning countertops and stoves and such i like to cook i use cast iron and season them a lot and i 'm messy sometimes she would clean and talk to me about nothing in particular .
whole she did this her breasts would shake sometimes almost becoming exposed from her robe while telling me about something on her mind .
me wanting to hear her thoughts and trying to ignore her breast was a losing battle or maybe a winning one 😛 .
it 's like her mind was able to entertain so much outside of herself it left her open to my private desires ... but if she 's so primed mentally she might catch me so i better be sneaky .
boobs ... boo ... ... ... boobs ... booooooobs ... .
it 's hard to explain the allure of it .
something about her ability to tease me so easily that i 'm so inept to her tactics but she let me try anyway and does n't hit me over the head with sexy '' .
she might have been doing it on purpose but it was so accidently sexy and not overt or expected .
she caught my on the chin and mentally put me on my heels by seducing me without being a hot slut '' if that makes sense .
come to think of it it had to be on purpose because she turned up the tension over the night .

i think netflix has been doing really well with sci-fi .
la liga have greatly benefited from pique ronaldo bale modric henry suarez while epl sides have weakened from those departures .
not to mention the epl became weaker with the departures of alex song who arsenal have till this day not adequately replaced .
as long as this continues la liga sides will continue to dominate the champions league .
many of churchill 's views were pretty extreme contemporaneously not just in retrospect .
i think you might be a bit bias to mecha anime s
it 's not about people quitting at a guess it 's about people using a stadium that they are used to at the expense of the other player whose camera angle etc can be effected etc .
if you press s to go back before the vault animation completes you can cancel it .
i think that the biggest problem will be the amount of data in the end the refresh rate is n't a big problem i had slow downs and flickerings on a 10 meters strip i made some tests once it had 600 leds but i 'm not 100 sure if the problem is the length of the strip and voltage drop or if its the amount of leds because de uno i tested had plenty of storage and ram left yet .
yep i 'm plannig on that each arduino.cs would have an array of leds array and write those in the byte that is sent via the com port communication i think that by putting a signal on the byte as to where does one strip starts and ends might be good i 'm still fleshing out these ideas .
i also want to have strip or at least device independent effects since all the calculations are multithreaded it will not be impossible .

i mean at first glance she looks amazing right ?
but being a flyer means she ca n't learn steady brearh one of the best a skills for dragons she is also weak to bows which is a very good weapon type that most dragons can effectively counter and her weapon does not have dc which basically every dragon wants .
this also means that she probably is n't going to be a very good enemy phase unit unless you use dc which makes her lack either some stats from fury or def stat+aether/vantage shenaningans .
and if you put guidance on her you lose the qr slot which is very important .
put qr seal and now you ca n't have iote'shield either !
so unless her stats are really op i think fae is still going to have better sinergy with the likes of nowi/tiki/corrin ... .
edit forgot to mention but if you put iote 's shield qr and dc on her she is probably going to be the best archer counter for flyers as they wo n't do much damage and probably wo n't be able to make a follow up either because of great flame 's ability .
not to mention she can counter against sacae 's blessing !
one strange thing that i have noticed when i was watching the simpsons is that some characters have odd colored hair mainly blue .
think about it all the vanhoutens the wigums and marge her sisters and her mother all have the same color hair an unnatural bright blue color .
could it be possible for all these characters to be related .
what evidence do i have well we can go back in their blood lines and with the vanhoutens we know that nana vanhouten who does n't have blue hair a detail that every single other vanhouten has met an american war vet who left her with child and went back to america and never saw her again .
now i prepose that that man 's last name was wiggim !
i say that marge 's mother 's maiden name was vanhouten .
cover this matpat or else i will nag at you till you do .
say a mortal and a god have a kid .

i 'm still a young '' fan having gotten caught up in the eagles in 2006 .
i was just 8 when they played in '04 so this level of success is beyond anything i 've known for the eagles .
it 's always been we 're a few years out '' and kelly will be legit '' or fire mcnabb and bench andy '' and frankly i thought when dougie got hired and the talent had be jettisoned that we were in for many years of misery .
so after very little misery you know comparatively to more seasoned eagles fans i 'm just not sure how to process our sudden success .
of course there are the preppers for what could be misery but i liked a different comment i saw that said at this point it feels like we 're playing with house money '' with this season .
i mean i think most of us expected 8-10 wins and maybe a wild card berth .
and while i love swole pole foles i could n't imagine he 'd bring us here especially after every regular season game not against the giants .
i guess what i 'm asking is for those who remember the 04 season how does this one feel in relation ?
sorry if this has been discussed before but when chrollo steals someone 's hatsu does it take their nen away completely or just that specific ability ?
like if someone had multiple hatsu techniques and he only stole one with bandit 's secret could they still use their other techniques ?
and could someone who had their hatsu stolen create a new hatsu technique later ?

i 'm 18 years old 5'9 '' dark brown hair and eyes ...
i 'm super into video games and computers but i 'm willing to talk about almost anything .
i 'm looking for someone who is potentially down to meet up and see what happens .
obviously we can chat and see if we click .
no pressure to do anything unless you want to .
if you 're interested at all send me a pm !
putting my wallet code in and hitting enter just reloads the website .
if it was anything else i would n't bat an eye but there is a possibility that it could be a sacred stones banner my one financial weakness in this game .
i 'm either setting myself up for excitement or disappointment but either way i 'm pretty nervous .
tron.game.com quoted 0.2 gtc=1 trx means potentially 2x returns on gtc coin with out much risk .
i took early position currently with 50 and still holding on it .
i see a lot of potential in crypto gaming and look at domain name 'game.com ' that is good enough to attract people into gtc coin .
i was told it is called a closed loop system .
i am having problems with two of the bedrooms they do n't warm up as well as the rest of the house .
my last house had forced air so i 'm new at this .
the first problem bedroom is on the second floor .
there 's one large baseboard radiator against two walls .
one of the two pipes coming out of the floor is very hot .
but the other is room temperature you can hold your hand on it for as long as you want .
when i bleed this radiator water comes out steadily but it is not hot .
i ca n't really tell if this radiator is mounted level it 's too big there 's a link below with pictures .
the second problem bedroom is on the third floor directly above the other one .
it is warm but it 's definitely not anywhere near as hot as the rest of the house .
also when i bleed it nothing comes out at all .
i took the bleeder screw all the way out and tried opening the hole with a small pick but it did n't do anything .
starting with the first floor and worked my way up .
on each floor i did the radiator farthest from the boiler first .
all the rest of the radiators seemed fine the pipes were very hot to the touch the whole length of the radiator .
the water that came out when i bled them was scalding hot and it came out steadily without any air pockets .
it was only the two above that had issues .
also i had the thermostat all the way up so the boiler was on continuously .
the guage said about 180 degrees fahrenheit and about 15 psi .
there are some cool plugins for plex for things like subtitles and sharing playlists collections and watch history .
i 've used plex plugins before when i had plex installed as an unraid plugin but now that i have everything coverted over to dockers i 'm not sure what the method would be to install plugins on the docker .
im a 15 year old male and started nofap 3 days ago .
my orgional intent for starting nofap was because i was tired of the way i felt after i pmoed and i need to kick my maturation and porn habbit .
one day i stumbled across nofap and read peoples testimonies about their benefits and how they felt after rebooting .
for the most part thigs have been going smoothly .
my acne cleared up alot and my self confidence has been a bit better and i have n't been depressed or had anxiety attacks since i started but at certian parts of the day i find my self to be extremely horny and unable to concentrate but eventually it subsides but when i go home and lay down some how i get turned on really quickly .
during this time my penis will start throbbing and i 'll feel like i 'm about to cum without even touching it or anything its completely 100 against my will also i 'm not looking at porn or masturbating or thinking of provocative thoughts but i 've been able to subdue these feelings for the first two days .
on the third day however as soon as i laid down in my bed i became horny again .
i thought i would just wait it out like i did the other two days but ended up ejaculating whilst shifting into a more comfortable position .
have any of you guys experienced this ? ? ?
anyway im going to be starting back up on friday becaus i like setting my favourite day of the week as a milestone because it motivates me more .
also i 'm waiting until friday to start up nofap again because i want to collect my thoughts and research more health related things to do ex .
in the meantime i 'm going to continue eating healthy and going for runs like i have since i 've started nofap because since i 've started this i 've felt better about my body .
seems a little strange to give that information to the survivor but not the killer .
so if you 're in the market for ice cream maybe steer clear of it or check their labels .
i did n't even think it 'd be actual bourbon in it but i could n't finish the small amount i 'd scooped myself because of the overpowering smell and flavor .
if this could be triggering for you make sure you scope those labels !

i win lane i would say about 85 of the time .
this feel very insignificant when about 70 of that 85 my top and mid lose lane hard or one loses hard and the other just loses .
i hardly ever get ganks dont need them a whole lot even though i freeze right before my tower 90 of the time .
i farm better in lane by about 8-15 at the 10 min mark majority of the games .
i try my hardest to keep my deaths under 5 every game but sometimes it is very hard when the top laner is fed to kingdom come a lot of the time .
i tried switching adcs for a few and found the most success most comfortable with xayah kalista and lucian .
i have got into promos 3 times and on the third i finaly got promoted then just got 3 teams in a row that seemed like they were new to the game .
i believe out of the three games i died 5 times total .
i always try to improve what i think i am doing poorly game after game .
i feel like i can see the results of this in each of my games but it doesnt show in terms of win rate .
i am very competitive and try to be the absolute best in everything and i am ashamed of having a winrate under 50 .
in fact right after my placements i lost 12 games in a row .
granted in those 12 games and played poorly and i switched champs and roles i believe a lot .
i am not a fan of the play 2 ranked games then take a break for while type of person how can i gain lp and rank up by not playing .
tl dr i am in dire need of help .
is there any way in these next two rallies to obtain a couple of the season 1 faction weapons i 'm still missing ?
i 'm still missing fire promise and stochastic variable .
am i to believe that i will never be able to aquire these guns ?
if so that is totally unacceptable bungie for two reasons
1 season one was fucked up bc you guys blocked access for people who did n't purchase your dlc so you decided to scrap the event
at least armor was fixed but your dumbasses forgot the only rolls that matter the guns .
hopefully i 'm wrong and this rant was for nothing but right now i 'm in rage mode bc i grinders both factions to 30 and did n't get either gun

one year ago exactly i posted https www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/5pu8gl/anyone_else_have_nexplanon_inserted_without_any ? st=jcsmxpfb sh=10fefdf4 a panicked little post about starting nexplanon only to discover the apparent horror show that is the birth control .
i 'd heard about cystic acne terrible weight fluctuations and most terrifying non-stop bleeding for months .
with no prior birth control methods utilized i 'm 21 5'10 122lbs nexplanon was my first and as long as things stay the way they 're going now only birth control i 'll be using for the foreseeable future or at least as long as bc is still covered by insurance .
one year later i have had no significant change in acne potentially even less acne than normal but i am working on my skincare routine no weight gain some people claim it increases their appetites but i did n't really notice and no periods .
about a month after insertion when i would normally get my period i had some spotting for a few days but nothing serious .
i have n't had anything else not even spotting or odd discharge since .
around the time i would normally get my period i often see an increase in what i assume to be hormonal acne but again it 's one or two spots .
as someone who suffers from severe anxiety and depression i was really worried about the mental side effects i read and that i 'd heard from a friend of mine who was forced to remove hers due to such a bad mental reaction to the implant .
so far i have n't noticed any significant changes in my moods or my mental health .
in the first few days i think i remember being a bit more tired than usual but it was n't anything out of the ordinary for me .
i ca n't speak to its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy for me as i do n't engage in piv sex lol but i assume my implant is properly in place as i don't/have n't had any discomfort and therefore it 's probably 99 effective .
i 'm posting this mostly because i see/saw a lot of really negative posts about nexplanon when i first got it that really scared me and while it seems to be that nexplanon either really works for you or really does n't work seeing the positive side can be relieving .
i have a number of friends who all swear by the implant as well and only one irl friend who hates it .
prior to nexplanon my periods were so bad that when i described them to my nurse and gyno for the first time both of them were shocked and i figure it 's a bit hard to surprise someone who 's seen it all .
i would have heat flashes so intense i 'd go outside in january without a coat in subzero temps mind fainting cramps so bad i 'd gone to the hospital thinking i 'd ruptured my appendix migraines muscle spasms the whole lot .
nexplanon has been an utter blessing knock on wood .
if this is a birth control you 're considering do n't be put off by how many negative posts there are people post when things are bad they 're not likely to leave a review when things are okay normal or even good .
everyone has different reactions to every different birth control and if things do n't work out it 's very simple to remove .
fingers crossed nexplanon continues to work well for me and if you 're considering it you as well .
posted this to r/mental health but i thought i would share it here as well seeing that it is n't exactly a specific mental illness or anything although it is definitely a confession .
long post i know but please read until the end .
i know this is kinda rude but nothing discourages me more on here than to post something to this subreddit and get no replies and not know how to deal with my problems .
i have posted stuff like this before but i thought i would put it together and make one big and hopefully final for this damn subject post about my problems .
i do n't just want to keep talking about them over and over agin
nothing like a sad reddit post at 12:30 am right ?
i 'm grounded right now first time in months lol so i 'm breaking that to post this real quick .
i 'm a 16 year old guy and if you are suicidal self-harming or have a tiny bit of childhood innocence left do not read any further .
so a lot to share ... where to start ... let 's start sometime when i was idk ... 8 ?
anyway when i was younger i used to think a lot .
it was interesting and i was able to form some ideas and comprehend a small amount of stuff at a younger age .
that was nice and all but when i was little i just could n't stop .
that is normal for a child to not be able to shut down or always be hyper and stuff .
once i started watching youtube that cut my attention span down a ton which helped that but did n't help my grades .
i could n't just stand and think though i needed to walk .
i would walk in circles just thinking about anything youtube minecraft pokémon girls all the fun stuff .
it was just school and overwhelming stuff about college and the future that i did n't want to think about .
it was no fun but i still just could .
after spending most of my life at 15 on my phone i looked back and regretted a lot .
not freedom of the internet or going places like i wanted then but freedom of time .
there was just so much time in the day .
when i was younger i was always compassionate and thoughtful .
instead of just being anxious about my problems i would be anxious about my families problems as well .
or lack thereof i would just walk around all day and think about what i missed .
it felt like every minute was but a second every hour was a minute .
i would turn up music so loud that it would block out everything around me .
alone time is ok. alone time can turn into something else though .
it can be something that you can get lost in .
you begin to lose yourself in nothing but yourself .
last year around late july was when it began .
i spent my days walking in circles checking the time and scheduling my day and double and triple checking only to reschedule for the hours yes .
no productivity it only got worse as i felt like i was n't moving .
i did n't stop because i broke free of it but because i gave in .
i stopped freaking out about everything during the day .
i just did that instead of sleeping at night .
i had been wearing headphones and listening to that but instead of love songs or a little bit of jay-z you know the rap you can actually hear ... i turned on rock music .
i could n't hear anything else and that 's what i wanted .
i did n't even listen to it i began to block the music out .
i started my days on reddit on another account .
that helped give me more of an outlet but i did n't do much on it .
as i grew closer towards the start of the school year i perked up a bit .
this was a schedule i had no control over .
something is out of my hands and i accepted that .
sure the anxiety was gone but that alone time was still there .
i made up fake scenarios in my head like you would in the shower .
when you have headphones on you can think deeper .
you become a little less aware about what you are thinking about and are able to think about anything .
about halfway through september i was thinking sad thoughts .
this thought process had slowed me down in life .
i thought about how much i wanted to be younger .
something changed over the year and i wanted my other self back .
i spent my special alone time reaching down into the saddest thing i could find .
i was having moments where i would break down at times because of my thoughts before but now those thought did n't phase me .
thoughts of school piled up now that school work piled up .
i found so much sadness and i do n't know why .
the anxiety came back because of a lot of problems concerning my grandparents and other distant family .
i thought about how i did n't have a permit .
and still do n't ... need to work on that ... and how everyone looked happier .
i stopped eating because the thoughts and the sadness just took priority .
i still am in denial of ever calling myself this .
i do n't know how else to describe it though .
everything in life was either dull or at night when the anxiety flooded my head really quick bad .
i felt behind in life and i did n't know how to change .
the anxiety got better but i was having no more of it .
no more of this weird emotional pain i 'm feeling and still to this day deny it being real .
i found a way to get rid of it .
this helped me hide a lot of my problems .
i could spend my life actually doing some stuff now .
the good news was that it only lasted three weeks .
anxiety goes away only to come back once i think about what would happen if my parents ever found out that i cut .
now i going to have to go into a ton of detail .
the first week i cut a lot but they were only some scratches .
then at the end of that week i wanted to cut .
i had a glass shard there is something about razor blades that i just can not do .
i never understood how a cutter scars oddly until i saw that on my thigh i stopped for nearly a whole week .
i got really mad and wanted to do something .
this time it was n't that deep but i was looking for pain .
it 's always goes pain for anger and blood for everything else .
now i 'm going to have to get into some real serious detail .
my grandfather was doing really badly and it had been really hard on my dad .
he kept finding dog hair on his work clothes and got really mad about it me and my sibling were supposed to be brushing the dogs but they did n't do it and i had been ... busy ... lately he threatened to throw the dogs out .
this made me so sad i was about to cry .
i sat there and a little voice that sounded just like mine kept telling me you know what will fix it ... right ? all of your problems will be gone ... now mind you i thought that the whole voices in someone 's head thing was fake until this .
i kept thinking and muttering under my breath no again and again .
i started to think about how i do n't curse a lot but i think that this requires some strong language .
this was a downward spiral until it all stopped .
a very dull knife in one hand and a small yet very deep cut in my wrist .
that scarred and it is plainly visible to this day although it is not very large .
i do n't know what stopped all this but i got a little better .
you see i did n't get on the internet a ton but when i did during this rough time it was n't good .
sad poems suicide stories gloomy sunday the bulgarian suicide song look it up if you want and some other stuff .
i was free of many problems but still a prisoner to my mind .
literally any scenario i could come up with that justified cutting .
i figured out an equation for how much vodka it would take to kill me .
not a lot seeing that eating very little for a few weeks and not stop walking in circles is an efficient way to lose weight i found out as many ways as i could to kill myself .
i always thought about how cold it would be and still do .
i always thought about a suicide poem i read author is anonymous not me and could not stop wandering back to .
she took a deep breath she counted to three .
a picture in her head of who they wanted her to be .
they wanted her to be normal happy and kind .
little did they know that this girl would be blind .
not blind by meaning but blind in the heart .
she walks around lifeless her heart beating but dead .
a walking corpse she 's lost inside her own head .
she is not how she was how she was once before .
she is one of the living but one of the dead .
part of her is missing she hangs on by a thread .
she hung her head low and with one final bow .
she stepped off the edge saying one final vow .
i can not change who i am as hard as any of you try .
this is me giving up this is one last goodbye .
i always thought about what she was thinking about how she was .
i tried to understand it but whenever i did i felt like i was back there again .
that was one of many things that still took up my day .
i wanted to cut every now and again and i did little things like poking myself with a knife and stuff to deal with it without actually making such a big mark .
good was 30 minutes to an hour of thought .
now where to end this ... my situation now .
i have stopped having a big problem with anxiety but only because i just chose not to care as much .
if i fail my classes i will kill myself .
i might not if it came to that situation but i ca n't change the thought process a ton until something like that happens .
i want to cut badly and sometimes i find myself fantasizing about what knife i was to cut with .
i do n't get on the dark web because i 'm afraid i might get hooked on what i might find because of how messed up i am in the head .
every time something happens as small as it may be i get closer to cutting .
not just mentally but i have put the blade on my wrist three times and now have bandaids just in case .
the scar on my wrist and the one on my thigh feel as if they are fading but maybe that 's just me wanted to minimize the thought of scars being all that bad .
sometimes i mark up my wrist with my nails to see what it would look like if i cut every time i wanted to but now i want to do it to pick a good spot.one final thing .
i feel ashamed to a high degree for how messed up i am and i just ca n't look at myself in the mirror .
i can do it to shave and stuff when i 'm not thinking about it but i still have trouble with it .
it started when i started cutting and now it is worse .
i ca n't even think about it unless i 'm typing or have headphones on .
just me and my thoughts but no headphones so maybe it wo n't go too bad .
it will be an interesting week none the less .
seeing that i am grounded i do n't know when i will be able to responded to any comments if i even get any .
if you have read to the end thank you !
you have no idea how much that means to me !
hopefully this will be my last post i will ever have to make about these problems although i doubt it .
it took me an hour and a half to type this all out lol its morning and i added a bit too sorry if there are some serious spelling errors .
the more you type on the app the more lag there is .
manos ano passado perdi o dia de comparecimento do serviço militar .

so i had a 60 win rate with her last season and in the preseason now i 'm significantly lower ranked and yet having a ton of trouble winning games .
obviously getting ahead is fairly easy but once ahead does n't seem like it 's possible to carry any more .
were there changes somewhere in the season 8 patches that hit her ?
last time i only did the event on my bowmaster and it was a breeze because we could do ranged attacks in the jq .
this time however that seems to have been patched .
while all the basement levels seem much smoother to do less traps level 1 the last escape map is extremely hard to do because i keep dying while inputting the commands to unlock the gates .
my bowmaster has 30k hp yet it is not nearly enough to tank through the guards that catch up and beat up on you at each gate.
on my blaze wizard magic guard does n't work as well and even my mihile ca n't tank through it .
one guard deals about 900 damage a hit and a few spawn only after reaching the gate making it impossible to clear them first.
was the event this hard for 'melee ' classes previously ?
edit1 realized that being ranged does n't really matter since the guards catch up to you anyway and the key change is that there are too many of them and that they are too painful .
i just do n't remember having this problem in season 1
you can see how i get swarmed by guards and only clear the stage with good rng .
in hindsight i guess it 's not that bad ?
popping decent hyper body before the stage might be a good idea and just pray for good rng .
conclusion for sea at least it seems that you ca n't get the guards to spawn before the commands appear .
however since dying has no penalty just redo the last stage as many times as you need while praying to rng .
btw there are save spots throughout the basements which are helpful in case you die especially b1
if you recall a while ago netflix released their new camera requirements for producing a netflix original .
this sent people into a frenzy of wanting to know if their camera made the cut or not along with many missing the point of the requirements and taking it to mean their camera is n't any good which is n't the case plus most of us are n't going to be contracted to make a netflix original .
now of course there 's different rules for b cams and i expected the gh5 to be right in there but there 's something that i noticed about the s that i was impressed by .
it actually ticks all of almost the requirements for a netflix original a cam which is just amazing .
• camera must have a true 4k sensor equal to or greater than 4096 photosites wide .
• bitrate of at least 240 mbps at 23.98/24 fps recording
• no looks or color corrections should be baked into the original camera files .
• aspect ratios greater than 2.00:1 must be evaluated and discussed with netflix for approval .
• framing chart must be shot before principal photography begins and processed through the dailies pipeline which will be shared with editorial post-production and vfx . ''
to achieve this the s brings on full dci 4k which is the true cinema 4k and assuming that the s can output this over hdmi the camera can achieve a great feat but not alone .
using the atomos shogun inferno you could theoretically record the gh5s ' 4kdci 10 bit vlog to prores hq and right there you 'd meet the netflix requirements for an a cam .
the only hiccup here would be that the gh5s actually has v-log l and not v-log but hopefully there 's some sort of payed option to upgrade or that may even be enough to meet the requirement for that i 'm unsure .
while of course anyone making a netflix original that 's a narrative would rent out a red arri or varicam but i 'm extremely impressed that panasonic have been able to produce a camera that could punch it 's weight into being an a cam for a documentary or anything that 'd require a smaller setup .
ca n't wait for it to go on sale to test it out !
i used to work for a it company providing technical hardware and software support to agencies .
user calls to report a dot matrix printer provided and maintained by us issue .
user my whole office has been unable to print since morning and i have already restarted the print server and printer to no avail .
me can you check if the ethernet cable is properly attached ?
if not can you try unplugging and plugging it back in ?
user i just tried that and still is n't working .
i then guided the user to perform a post check on the printer to which the printer passed without an issue just that it could not receive any print jobs from the rest of the office .
as their office is located about 30mins away in the small country that we live in sg i prepared a spare dot matrix printer and headed down to replace the printer due to a possibility of a faulty network port .
mind you these printers are not the super big ones so they can be hand carried .
when i arrived at the location before i whipped out the spare printer i went and checked the cable connection to my surprise was n't plugged in all the way .
after hearing the click sound the printer came to life and started printing the multitude of print jobs queued .
i told the user it was fixed and then headed back to office .
tldr printer wire was loose went down to push the wire in .
i do know a few facts about the history of mochi .
it is believed that special seraphs worshiped as gods brought the rice to make mochi to the people and in return humanity made mochi as an offering to the seraphs .
mochi was so revered that it was only eaten by royals and being given mochi as a wedding present marked a long and fruitful marriage !
so recently the party ran afoul some very powerful mages and hid under a paladin guild 's skirt .
a guy who i heavily implied was very influential and very powerful basically told them he 'd mediate peace negotiations with the mages since he did n't want the mages causing issues in his '' city .
try to assassinate him in the open in said city ... the rogue almost stabbed him in the back middle of the day at high town and i basically just made him miss his stab and a friend of the party just come out of nowhere and just start a chat with him basically stopping him noticing he was doing something very stupid .
i basically just pulled all of this out of my ass to keep them alive even if the rogue crited and rolled full damage the guy would have lived and turned him into dust and then sent the dust to another dimension .
i kinda regret saving him though mostly i did it because it was titanically stupid and another pc had already died that same session ... still basically twisted fate to save their ass the things you do to keep the party safe from their own stupidity i think we 've all been there .
friends another year is behind us and a new one is about to begin .
now is the time to cherish those who have helped us while searching for new comrades !
i 'm already all set up on coinbase help me understand how good or bad this exchange is so that i can decide if it 's worth the trouble to open yet another account .
last week jan 31 2018 wave we were able to trigger an ex raid at a carefully selected and monitored gym .
the gym is a singular parkgym inside a level 12 s2 cell .
this cell is one of only two cells in our city that contains only one parkgym .
the other singular parkgym is well known even before the interest in s2 cell theory exploded and has hosted ex raids a few times already .
the gym is located at a gas station close to the motor way at the edge of a medium sized city population about 220,000 .
the gym has never been popular for raids nor gym battles since it is relatively far from any residential areas by foot .
it also does n't provide much possibilities for parking for larger groups of people in cars .
the fact that there is little noise '' surrounding this gym makes it an ideal target for a raid trigger experiment and the possibility for careful monitoring .
of course we ca n't account for spoofer activity we did not encounter spoofers in the lobby but apart from that we believe the data is correct and complete for this single week of raiding .
for privacy reasons we use abbreviated versions of trainer names .
the vast majority of trainers came from one team .
a high diversity of trainers from different teams does not seem as necessary for a successful ex raid trigger as many including us believed .
as with team diversity level diversity does n't seem as important as we think it is .
we did not do that many raids ten raids in six days .
all but one raid resulted in successfully defeating the raid boss .
catching or not catching the raid boss was not accounted for .
raids were performed in a traditional fashion no repeatedly entering and leaving the lobby no splitting the team in smaller groups to consecutively keep the lobby filled .
it is clear that the omastar raid on jan 18 was the big one .
eight people who participated received ex raid passes although some of these could be attributed to earlier raids .
seven might have received a pass but this pass would then have been overwritten '' by an ex raid pass for another gym .
frustratingly like always seems to be the case some people arbitrarily did n't receive a pass .
an interesting case is jico who only did one raid early on and got a pass .
another interesting case were feki desi and hetr who all did only one single raid on the last day .
after many frustating months we feel happy to be closing in on mewtwo like we are doing now .
we hope this experiment gives a small contribution to the theory and helps other teams be as successful as well .
recently i worked on two learning projects which i released as libraries
rubikdetector https github.com/cjurjiu/rubikdetector-android rubik 's cube detection library using opencv from c
animcube https github.com/cjurjiu/animcubeandroid android port of a java web applet that displays a 3d rubik 's cube .
the first was just a way for me to understand better how jni works and also learn some c .
the second was just a fun project that i wanted to play with .
while their usage is very niche i hope some of you guys might find them useful .
i also plan on making a few updates to them both in the following months .
i 've just migrated from ios and whild im loving android i am struggling to find a keyboard that will autocorrect my typing without having a suggestion bar on top of the keyboard .
suggestion bars are a real bug bare of mine so at thr moment i 'm using the xperia keyboard with suggestions turned off however my thumbs are fat so i 'd really love the option of as you type autocorrection .
all the keyboards i 've looked into so far have the suggestion bar and autocorrect hand in hand so that you ca n't turn off one without the other .
here 's the track the sample starts at 0:40 if you want to skip
i feel like this is a really niche sample to notice in 2018 but i imagine some people noticed this back when it was released in 98 as ow was released the year before .
i do suspect that the sample could be another sample used for ow and it 's just a coincidence the same sample is used both tracks .
i 'm just looking to get the missions done and mess about .

from the matches i 've played it 's always been defense sided .
there are too many choke points too many places to wrap around and flank from literally every direction .
i like what they tried to do with the map but the execution was just terrible .
it seems practically impossible for the attacking team to make a push against the defense team if the two teams are of equal skill .
my whole playgroup absolutely hates the map for these reasons and i 'm scared to see it in competitive because i just know it 's gon na be terrible .

i do n't remember exactly when the big red button first appeared .
when i went to school hung out with friends occupied myself it was nowhere to be seen .
like an infant lacking object permanence my younger self believed the button to be gone in these easier moments .
i was surest of myself when i was in ap classes and section captain in marching band with a trip abroad on the horizon .
the harder times came when the sun fell when i had precious little to occupy myself .
it was on quiet nights when night creeps towards morning that the button returned .
it was always present existing quietly in the back of my head waiting patiently for my guard to drop .
the button did n't appear every night but i knew as sure as the sun would rise i would confront it again .
in fact all i ever wanted was that button .
i longed more than anything physical i 've ever known to press it to change that one thing about myself that needed to change .
i hated myself for wanting to press that button .
the thoughts in my head speared me with guilt every time i reached for it .
part of me always that knew deep down that if could actually do it that i 'd be happy that if i could actually make that change i would be fine for once in my life .
it offered it in a silent silken voice but at the cost of questioning everything i knew at the cost of facing fears i never prepared for .
i was n't brave enough to let my true self live and so i buried her in my mind .
the button and i existed like this for some time .
i submitted to the internal voices that screamed at me to be what i 'm supposed to. i played the role i was cast and pretended it was okay into adulthood .
after a decade of pretending i could n't continue the charade any longer .
tired of giving in to the toxic thoughts i always have i listened to what the button had to say .
my former self was a creature of pain and confusion .
although it 's a bittersweet goodbye i do want to thank him for finally pressing that button and allowing the real me to exist without it .
the greek fuck boy squad trying to be relevant being toxic and slandering lirik saying he is racist .
let me just go see greeks vods filled with cringy 12 yr olds spamming ggx gang gang trihard 7. probably the most annoying thing on twitch .
i wonder if the people that spam that actually think they are tough .
so for some people that may have seen me around you may have heard me mention on several occasions that i rarely have dreams .
i 'm not sure if it 's that i do n't dream or i 'm simply absolutely unable to recall them .
that being said i recently had a dream and i can remember it pretty clearly .
on top of that my waifu was in there so i was beyond happy .
ritsu was in my class and so was her childhood friend mio .
she was always teasing mio as usual and what not and class went on .
since i can be a bit of a class clown and she can as well it was n't long before we knew each other .
we quickly became friends and teased mio together and what not .
simply classmates that suddenly became friends and acted like dumbasses together .
later on and my dreams do tend to skip around in time quite a bit we 're walking home or something .
i 'm with ritsu and mio and we passed a music shop .
mio showed distress over the fact that there were no left handed bass models .
because it 's a dream and it 's like i just met them ritsu explains to me that mio is left-handed and so she 's always like this at music stores since leftie-bass models can be rare or more pricey .
being me i just shout out play upside-down ! ''
at this point mio looks at me as if i 'm stupid but i was very much serious .
i picked up a left-handed guitar to prove my point and began playing it in a right-handed position which would make it upside-down relative to me .
i even emphasised the fact i could play chords and that i 've learned the scales upside-down as well so i can improvise too .
so after i tell her this and demonstrate that it 's possible and fun mio begins walking around the music store leaving me and ritsu behind .
ritsu was kind of surprised over the sudden change in mio 's aura .
at this point i could tell ritsu was more fond of me since i helped her friend .
i ca n't say if i done-diddly sealed the deal and she liked me but she definitely thought of me more than that kid in class '' for sure .
she asked my why i even know how to play guitar upside-down and i just explained that it 's to have more fun on the instrument and because my favourite guitarist is a leftie who plays upside-down exclusively .
at this point the dream ends with me remembering i need to go somewhere and i start running off .
just wanted to share this dream because i never have dreams and a dream about my waifu is even more rare .

i discovered windows sonic for headphones feature which was released with fall creators update .
it 's a way to virtually generate surround sound with a stereo headset .
i used to have a pair of dolby pro logic surround headset i used with my 360 and i loved how it made me a better player because i 'm more aware of where things are coming from .
at the moment i 'm kind of gaming on the cheap on my old laptop and it would be great if windows sonic will work with d2 .
does anyone have any experience with getting surround sound to work on pc d2 ?
i was looking into making a vr gym simulator where you 'd do various workouts with motion controls to build your body up or down depending on your starting size .
i was wondering if anyone was working on character model avatars that could morph from various states example fat to medium-sized to fit to muscular ?
basically the weightlifting mechanic in san andreas only in vr and using motion controls in a virtual gym setting .
for example genesect buff says strengthens all ... . for 3 turns '' .
i mean imagine i have another pokemons with higher speed than genesect .
it has 4/3 of speed so that pokemon will attack 4 times while genesect will attack 3 .
will those 4 attacks still be granted by the weather buff ?
when they patched it back in they made you wait until level 21 to unlock it .

lol your edit sounds exactly like the anti-semitic crap that my grandparents heard in germany as the nazis rose to power .

sorry but what you have here is a conspiracy theory .
it 's probably the most investigated conspiracy theory we have seen in decades and still there is n't any evidence for it just a bunch of innuendo and claims that these people are sneaky '' .
yes trump is a shady character and has shady characters all around him .
however that does n't mean that some fanciful story which lacks a single shred of evidence despite the beat efforta of the entire us law enforcement the entire media etc should be believed .
on top of all that you are conflating two separate events here .
the dossier claims trump hired prostitutes to pee on a bed that obama had slept in .
the interview you reference is about someone else offering to send prostitutes to trump 's room which may or may not have even been the same one as obama allegedly stayed in .
even more this was trump 's own room that he was sleeping in .
do you think he hired these hookers and then slept in the piss covered bed ?

another factor is that my aluminium 's are at 24 foc and carbons 27 which makes them stop wiggling in flight faster which would help with a weak spine i imagine .

a product can still be faulty by default within packaging even if it was bought anew .
if you are constantly having internet problems with your ds in multiple places using different wireless providers then there could be something wrong with your wireless card in your ds itself .
if that 's not the problem then there 's only one other possibility which is that you might be getting kicked from your multiplayer lobbies and you perceive those as disconnects .
i also thought this when i played some 4u on my ds .
i would enter a gathering hall and then i would get a disconnect message turns out that i was kicked from the host .
the message you receive is the same if you get kicked versus you getting disconnected because of your internet .

3.38 is the start of the durham hike but that landscape is high cup nick which is just the other side of the border in cumbria .
depending where you are in north yorks it might not be too far away .
spectacular place well worth a hike on its own !
it seems like a pretty high level squad already .
i wo n't go into details about individuals that you may or may not replace since others are more knowledgeable and you may know best but you look like you can do the boosts one more time .
one thing that i do do if i 'm debating buying the boosts what is it 120 x 3 packs in your case ?
is to take the 1000 boosts that i 'm you ?
are getting and divide by 35 37 whatever to get the average boosts per boost type that i can expect then look at how many players i have that will be close to the next level 7 in your case and if its half or more of the squad and its a matter of a few or less than ten boosts for each type of boost i then ask will that and other boosts i get in this campaign put me over the top or near the top ?
you can also get these extra marginal boosts through matchups etc .
so getting you close to 7 '' with a large boost pack is what matters at this stage not necessarily putting you over the top to 7 .
it 's like instead of going out to hunt experiencing the hunt you shoot at animals in cages leaving the meat .

hey you ... last week my girlfriends cat also passed away suddenly .
it was probably one of the few things she really really loved .
sitting with her that night while she looked at old photos and videos had to be one of the saddest feelings .

i have to admit when i watched the episode that had the large graffiti about nancy in season 1 i hated steve until i saw him change into this character that is n't afraid to step up and hold himself accountable even going as far as to beat the demigorgan with a fucking spiked baseball bat
the difference is bjs changed the public perception of him after he took the challenge and schooled lemieux
i think it 's more like casuals now just finding him because he took on a name rather than the level of opposition .
eubank was decent level opposition just not a big name when saunders beat him .
lee is equal opposition to lemieux just not as big of a name .
lemieux on the other hand is a name just by proxy of having been beaten by golovkin .
just being a name is enough to inflate the worth of you to most casuals .
i 'm also gon na posit an uncomfortable idea for nearly everyone here but i do n't care if it makes you uncomfortable it 's worth considering that maaaaaaaybe race might have something to do with it too ?
like what does saunders and fury do that much different from wilder ?
all of them are loud abrasive and obnoxious as hell .
hell one of the three made pretty insensitive comments about jews and another one of them regularly spouts really misogynistic shit over twitter .
i 'll give you a hint too it 's not wilder who said misogynistic or anti-semetic things .
the love for joshua is n't really a counterpoint to this idea either since joshua is n't loud abrasive and obnoxious .
it reminds me of that interview ali did with cathal where he pointed out how white people love black fighters that are humble and obedient but the moment one comes out and declares himself the greatest the prettiest unbeatable then they go that nigg talks too much '' .

5 point for offering croutons to tossed salad and 10 points for archer reference !
gaming has become much more open and welcoming to everyone but unfortunately for women who are at the prime age for owl 18 the 10 years of experience that they could have gotten is already lost .
i do think that a trail blazer could exist i just also think we need to give it time .
and in the meantime we need to nurture equality and encourage anyone girl or boy to pursue their interests in video games .
i could n't tell you but i 'm sure someone else will .
women are one of my favourite bands of all time .
band camp is like basic training for the army .
it beats you up and sets you in the right tone for the upcoming season .
it also is a good time to build the basics .
so i would say to be successful you need a good mind set and band camp definitely sets the right mind for me .
it 's a buff to a ton of midlaner but not all .
high manacost midlaners will lose a lot of the early power that this rune gave them since it effectively removed mana management .
and it 's always a possibility to miss the spell that is supposed to proc it .
reminded me of the ethos church music from xenogears .
i stood and listened to it for about 20 minutes before doing anything in indoline .
it reminded me of that breakthrough moment from xenogears where you make it to shevat after a brutal god damn fight with seibzehn and climb of babel that instantly set me into total harmony .
in fischback 's ama and you know fischback nice reputable guy he said that sierra received the most gracious and misleading edit and that she was awful to be around .
i do n't think i can unsee what i saw sorry .
though it would be cool since the original eirika is basically fir with a legendary
did it last year and it was great apart from getting into brussels with hundred others and no fucking tomorrowland people with the signs to direct us where to go !
like with the flights as i did that previously too
so we all wandered around for 30-45 mins before finding them all waiting in some other part of the station you couldnt get to ! ! !
i seriously dont know what the hell they were thinking .
the car with the bar was very rowdy music playing and the poor bartender couldnt hear peoples orders some idiots kept smoking and vaping in there .
got told off numerous times but still kept doing it .
the seats are done in alphabetical order my partner and i have very different surnames and were 5 cars apart .
now that i know where to go and they hopefully dont change the shuttle location it 'll be easy this year but everyone on the train had nfi where to go .
we asked anyone we could inside/outside the station and no one had any idea .
a touch of bronzer would add some warmth to your skin .
i would apply the brow product with the thin straight edge brush real techniques eyebrow brush works well as the tail is a bit thick at the tip and you can tell it 's been drawn on .
hmm to me it felt like a betrayal she flipped everything on its head ged was now a pathetic virgin who could n't do household chores well instead of a heroic mage etc .
i believe it has been stated that she wrote the book after getting heavily involved in feminism and it certainly seems to carry some of the more toxic ideas from the more wild-eyed proponents of the movement .
it 's interesting to hear a different point of view though i 'm glad you liked it .
my portfolio is way to diversified and i want to convert some coins into my more promising ones once i make profit off of them so i can bring it down to 10 coins total .
i 'm at 18 right now ... thank you reddit shills .
we 've seen a significant increase in 3 point reliance late now that both big guys are at 4 fouls .
and netflix can feed 4k hdr content to the projector ?
but that 's my point why you want to try to make the damage be 40.2 ?
when you could simply take away all clothes and use it as a unit of 1 ?
my parents would probably kill themselves if they saw me dead .
as much as i want to die i do n't want to hurt others .

i 'm just curious because my high school 's biggest guy was like 6'7 and he was our best shooter lol .
i 've noticed the phrase virtue signalling '' is most often used as a form of asshole signalling by the types who like to brag about how un-pc they are .
it is interesting that they 're essentially implying that humans are naturally selfish assholes and actually caring about something is unnatural .
interesting that is in the sense that they 've signalled they 're someone for me to ignore and avoid .
that shit did n't fly when i was in either .
maybe times have changed but they did n't just force you to re rate unless you failed to meet criteria .
i still have n't found my incredibly common name on a bottle ... but it still makes me smile a little when i see a name of someone i know on it
okay so i am sort of collecting funko pop vinyl things .
i have a small collection 8 of things that really mean a lot to me and hold a special place in my life .
i went to the sub for it and just ... it 's a very downvote heavy sub .
i do n't get why some subs are this way but some are just a downright pain in the ass to post to because of that .
the worst of it all is that it 's a small community it 's not like it 's inundated with stuff .
he looked familiar but i was really distrusting him for some reason ...
he still may die but now i 'm not so sure .
seems that you have a water safari with octillery and gyarados ... i ca n't check the third pokemon unless you 're online .
i got a glass bed off ebay 15 and a glue stick when my heated bed broke gearbest still has n't shipped my replacement board ... . and now my anet a8 prints pla fine without any heating .
plus it 's faster because i do n't have to wait for the bed to heat up .
when i put glue on tape though it did n't work as well .
i just had to make sure that the nozzle distance was correct otherwise it would n't stick to the bed and would warp .
that pretty much looks like what i would expect it to look like .
a friend on discord called the dates for the last 2 banlists so i 'll post in their stead .
they called january 29th for the list to drop february 4th for it to take effect .
now it 's strange since this has n't happened for a few banlists to be dropped one day but take affect another but whatever .
i wo n't make any specific guesses to what the banlist will be but i 'm hoping for 1 card to get the banhammer level eater .
though what i want for the f l list is to have it be overhauled .
there 's stuff at 1 or 2 that i ca n't even really justify for it to be there other than just pure laziness to take it off .
what flip deck is there that can honestly abuse night assailant or am i just missing something ?
machamp knocks out both in about the same amount of time taking about the same amount of damage in return .
yeah nothing with a double weakness is much of a defender not that defenders are very meaningful outside of the blissey/chansey/snorlax crowd .
well i heard the whole movie was a fabrication made up by banksy himself to sort of showcase his lifestyle .
mccain basically abandoned every single reason he was nicknamed a maverick
truthfully the reason i smoke pot and cuss is to rid myself of the squares .
i 'm completely fine being called nuts but i 'm seldom called stupid .
so even though i get stoned forget about shit etc..
i 'm still giving my honest thoughts about what i know to be .
i may not be short and sweet but i really try to be a voice that you know isnt trying to get views or followers for the celebrity .
moonbase alpha members and i have already done very very well considering the market climate so i guess i just make these videos because i do n't have anyone else in my social circle who really wants to discuss it .
though i 'd love to say i wont smoke as much '' it 's just not true ...
i think it 's time to be ourselves and put our ideas on the table for debate the us has become to irrational when it comes to new ideas .
if we want to create the future we need to be it .
just did 3 singles pulled toshiro never gon na do multis again lol
you should consider why people dont like the name .
please take the time to choose a good name or spend more time generating different names for us to consider .
your name is important because it 'll be the first impression .
please dont skimp out on this and dont ask other people to do your work for you .
the city was/is doing a lot of construction and changed the light so it 's only about 20 seconds now between a vehicle arriving on the cross avenue and the light changing .
girl behind the rangers bench looks like she 's dressed to go to winnipeg .
even the guy you were replying to was n't arguing that maybe u/oldirtybaron can clarify just eye rolling over the progressives ' modesty campaign .
in fact even your point was n't that it was aesthetic .
you said it should not always be highlighted especially if it 's compromising . ''
sweet i 'll try it i live next a little town that grows awesome sweet corn
i would say they are almost the same except ecchi tends not to go as far sexually as smut .
smut includes hardcore sex acts and could extend as far as illegal sex acts .
so imo asking for smut without ecchi would be a very roundabout way of asking for only hardcore sex .
could be windows power management turning stuff off and not waking it up properly ?
my point was that the majority of this forum told me he wouldnt hire an experienced oc .
and used that nonsense as another method to attack jackson .

if only there was a recent example of popularity being interpeted as proof of correctness
if we break up we gain a solid support line and possibly big move upwards if we break down it stays as resistance and we likely go to 1.15 dollars so pretty important .
i had the same thought then i went to vietnam bali some other asian countries and the usa hardly anyone wore seatbelts it really surprised me .
some vehicles did n't even have seatbelts or the part you attach the seatbelt to .
not on facebook is thier any where else to watch announcement ?
before the change i hated them because you either used the gamma trick or you stayed inside because going out was a death sentence .
now you either stay inside or you just walk around outside .
going out and actually farming or doing a rad run is just not worth it you 're either exposing yourself or you 're making noise in both situations anyone nearby has the advantage so you may as well just afk like you used to .
i 'd prefer the old nights back if there was a way to stop the gamma trick or just make nights so bright that using a gamma trick is worthless but at least people can actually do things during the night

okay so i 'm actually from the soft left of the party my 2015 ballot was burnham corbyn as my first two choices i defended corbyn up until february 2016 on this sub and got a post about me on r/shitcorbotssay i became disillusioned with what i perceive to be him making incompetent mistakes that would be simple to fix i agreed with everything in the 2017 manifesto apart from scrapping all tuition fees entirely and my issue with the direction of the party is the alarming emergence of antisemites from the woodwork not policy .

on the left panel katakuri can dodge '' luffy 's punches by turning the area he is going to punch into mochi .
something similar happened with aokiji when he got stabbed by whitebeard but survived by making a hole in his body where he got stabbed .
in the right panel luffy 's punch connects because katakuri is too angry/unfocused to predict the future and in turn is unable to convert to mochi to dodge the attacks .
yeah i think no matter the theory this area is my specialism the board should be used for how it 's intended it just opens up information boards to have practically anything on it otherwise

when i was young girlfriend material meant someone with a personality i could tolerate who was dtf .
really you 're just so used to each other there 's nothing for it but to give up and make horrible little roommates with them so you can hate something else together more than each other .
i needed to see my wife 's qualities as a good person more than a tolerable or hot person and also see her interact with children for me to realize that having kids with her would n't be a disaster .
i needed to see her values and opinions align enough with mine and that she could effectively transmit them .
and i liked very much her general interest in the world science and technology the future and a good understanding of human nature and society all this sets up our kids pretty well coming from her to them .
i 'd have cared about none of this in a girlfriend at 18 .

many years ago google had a feature in google chrome or chromium where webpages were not only preloaded as you typed the url on the omnibox address bar but they were also rendered as you typed .
it made the browser feel like lightning since most of the time google chrome would only need a few letters and then it knew where you wanted to go .
for example you typed f on the address bar the facebook url would be autocompleted but the website would also load and be rendered when you press enter you are already at the site .
i have been looking for this feature everywere and have not found much documentation on it .
the only thing i remember is that i think google removed the feature because it used too much bandwidth since each letter you typed made chrome render a whole website as you get closer to the website you want .
the thing is that most people visit the same websites every day .
so google is going to predict the right website i want most of the time .
and nothing beats the speed and convenience of just starting to write the letters of where you want to go and already being there .
it felt like google was reading your mind and taking you there .
does anyone one know of a way to enable this or an extension or browser that does something similar .
! mainly rendering the sites as you type not only preloading the website on the background .
without studying it too much it could n't help but to remind me of jed .
toes trilogies even the publish dates are around the same time jed 's stuff came out .
it looked interesting enough and i put it in the want to read '' stack .
doing a quick search on google for thomas campbell vs jed mckenna '' show some more similarities .
ever since watching hang the dj '' i ca n't say aaaahh '' after a drink without getting self-conscious and trying to spot people judging me nearby .
the current setup is a nightmare for someone like me who usually plays at fairly low dpi/sens .
right now my sens is 1.2 in-game which is fine ... but when i aim down sights with either weapon it feels like its 0.2 which is quite odd .
i think it 'd be cool if you could claim small islands as bases or at least build some sort of shack on them .
maybe even allow us to anchor our ships and build onto them as a hub/trading area of some sort .
running cargo from one area to another for a price would be a cool feature .
it adds another level of risk vs reward for those doing it .
i can just imagine how cool it 'd be to sailing across the sea with 1-2 ships carrying cargo to various locations .
cosmetics aside i want to be able to spend gold on my ship .
unfortunately i 'm rostering the pair and am now in sort of a dilemma .
my teams wr corps is bare and going into next year i have no clear starters .
i 've had edelman for 3 or 4 years now and could have used him this past season .
i could use both a standout wr or roster space but it would really sting if i drop the wrong player because i 've basically sacrificed a year to keep my team corps together .

i 'm looking for any story that features humans for their ability to tame and bond with the animals around them .
it would be super cool if there were any written from the pov of the animal or xeno thing interacting with the human .
i have enough of all the matches in which i find the hatch before the survivors and the only thing i can do is just wait for him to play my role in that stupid mind game of who does the first step ?
considering the reverse bear trap introduced a timer mechanic i suggest to use it after the killer close the hatch and it should stop running only if the survivor is near or working on a generator/exit gate .
or just let the last survivor win by default .
at the moment there are too many survivors who left the third one die on the hook because they found the hatch .
if it was n't a thing at least the third survivor would have a chance to survive .
i love the idea of a miraculous escape but this way it is completely unbalanced .

hey i am new to unreal engine 4 are there any tips you can give to get me started
my friends and i have played a few 7th sea 2e games and while we love the setting the default risk/consequence/opportunity just does not compute with my group .
we 're so used to roll to see if you do the thing or fail '' from the myriad of systems before this we just ca n't shake that mentality when we play .
we also share many of the criticisms that have already been voiced by the many reviews out there about this so i wo n't rehash them .
i feel some of them are overly harsh anyway .
in my browsing around for similar games i came across all for one règime diabolique which uses the ubiquity system .
basically you play french musketeers except there 's magic and monsters .
like 7th sea ubiquity uses a dice pool system though instead of making groups of 10 you roll successes each die has a 50/50 chance to score a success and you need x number of successes to succeed at doing a thing .
while i did consider adapting ubiquity to the 7th sea setting it occurred to me that maybe i could leave 7th sea as is but plug in a purely optional house rule for very basic rolls without causing too much of a disruption to the rest of the rule set .
use this outside of combat when a single player character is either attempting a fairly straightforward task or in a situation where a skill would be used passively such as notice but there is a reasonable chance for failure .
after a trait+skill is decided the gm sets a target number of raises required to succeed .
if the player makes that number of raises or more they succeed .
opportunities may present themselves if they exceed the target while consequences may occur if they fail .
players making a roll with a skill they lack unskilled roll one less die in their die pool .
characters that are being pressured '' similarly roll one less die for any action other than the one chosen by the pressuring character .
again this would be used pro re nata when you want an element of chance but do n't want to make it into a big deal or spoil an unseen surprise .
one of the worst case scenarios i can think of is an unskilled character who has an average trait 2 .
this means they would only roll 1 die giving them a 10 chance of making one raise .
a target higher than 1 raise means the task is impossible for them .
my estimate based on some probability calculations would be 1 raise for easy 2 for average 3 for hard 4 for daunting .
incompatibility with a specific rule or advantage i 'm forgetting please say so if you think of one
so like many people i unlocked the map maker '' achievement on single player .
the achievement transfered over to my online ragarok character as well .
however when i started a new aberration character i get all the other achievement skins except the map maker hunter hat skin .
why would it not be unlocked on my entire account ?
does anyone know what time this game will release in north america pst ?
ca n't seem to find any information on this .
it 's pretty worn but still 100 functional and running ios 9.3.4 which can be jailbroken on jailbreakme or homedepot .
if i use grapple how do i sling myself ?
i 've seen some people do it but i ca n't even get close to what they 're doing .
also kinda want to know what the best weapons are for ar 's and snipers because those are the two types i like to use .
we all know that the displacement equal delta x which x is a position so why is the velocity equal delta x over delta time not delta delta x over delta time ?
which the velocity is taking the derivative of displacement with respect to time

i just dove into lego head first over christmas started on whim with bb-8 and somewhat instantly amassed about ten more sets and even though i have to build this 80 wal mart star destroyer still i 'm already looking forward to my next build after that .
i 'm certainly the antithesis of the lego movie and an very much a direction follower and so while things can get complicated in the sets i 've put together so far it 's still fun and almost therapeutic .
so what 's the distinction that makes an expert set an expert set ?

i have a couple questions regarding progression on a bulk for beginner lifters .
i 'm not necessary counting calories i do n't have a targeted weight goal but if i had to estimate im eating 3k-3.5k a day 19m 5'11 '' 163lbs .
since i 've started eating real good this year my workouts have been phenomenal and weight is going up easily .
now that my tm has surpassed my beginning 1rm how much should i be increasing per week in regards to having proportionate lifts ?
this current cycle i hit 5 reps ez on my squat 1 is that safe to call a 10 lbs increase ?
i 'm just worried that some of my lifts numbers wont be proportionate and the weight will become unsustainable .
does anyone know if there is a way to confirm the wristband you buy from someone is legit ?

i have a 89 for a quarter grade which brought my semester grade down to a 91 for apgov .
the reason i have a 89 is b/c i got a zero on one test my teacher administered b/c i was accused cheating '' quite unfair but oh well .
that means my grade is an a minus for the semester .
if i had a 25 on the test my semester grade would go up to an a .
btw i got a 100 on every other assessment besides a unit test which i got a 94 on ... technically i could have pulled off a 92 in the class and got an a for the semester if i got a 100 on the test and the 6 extra kahoot credit points she offered if you got 1st place in the kahoot before the test and the study session after but ... again ... it 's close to impossible .

hey guys i am currently working on an ep of new original songs that have a strong linkin park influence more info on that later that ep is also made for you guys and i decided to do a linkin park remix to catch some attention before we release the songs .
i have a lot of ideas but i guess most importantly i wanted to ask you guys who have helped me so much through the recent events what you all want to hear the most ?
i would love to give back to you guys and hopefully make some of you feel better too .
leave suggestions below guys ill look through them carefully and decide which one i 'll be able to pull off as realistically as possible links to acapellas would be very helpful .
another thing i should mention is i defiinitely want to use chester and mikes vocals over them .
thanks everyone greatly looking forward to hearing your ideas !
but you move your finger and it zooms towards the pepsi bottle .

as im sure most of us know the colours on the screen lean to the cooler side but it feels like the update has turned it even cooler my twitch icon isnt even purple anymore .
first of all i 'm a regular fifa player futchamps sb fut online and offline seasons and career mode so i think i know the game quite well without being an exceptional player .
when ea presented squad battles my first thought was nice a chill offline fut gameplay that will let us win some 'good ' rewards '' .
and i still think it 's worth playing despite a lot of people thinking the rewards are not worth it that 's another debate of course .
when playing sb i can totally understand that the other team whatever the chem or rating it is on is boosted at 99ovr or at least has boosted stats depending on the difficulty .
what i do n't understand is why your own players are losing stats .
i do n't know if there 's a way to prove this of course .
but i 'm sure alot of you have felt that a particular card played waaaaay better online futchamps seasons etc than when you played sb .
for those doubting me try playing with your team in sb and afterwards play an offline season match against a legendary/ultimate team division 1 or 2 has those difficulties .
of course the opposing team will not be boosted but your own players will feel at lot more responsive and better than when playing sb .
when purchasing a certain card i 'd like to play with that same card .
not have two 'versions ' of that card one who plays normally and the other one which ca n't control a simple ball or make a 5yard pass ...
i 'm on the verge of purchasing r10 89 version and i 'd like to enjoy this card in every gameplay .
the problem is that i know that during sb games i will sometimes hate him because of his reduced stats eventhough online he will be much better .
so i do n't mind sb being scripted or whatever and playing a bronze team with 99 stats everywhere ...
but please ea do n't take stats away from players in sb matches it 's freaking annoying
ps i know that players make dumb moves/shots/passes online as well but that 's just the shitty gameplay sometimes .
i almost never use theming and it 's just filling up my sbinject folder .
wildcard needs evolving not the survivor.. just wondering when the same bs we 've had to go through for 2 years is going to end ?
it 's a aaa priced game with a much larger studio than what many of these solid indie games have yet when i play a 20 game on steam i 'm always thinking why is it impossible for wc to achieve this ? ''
background hisoka expresses to netero that the last person he would want to fight in the exam is killua .
hisoka is arguably the best battle strategist in the show so this comment is a big a deal .
just an opinion this is just my own personal theory based on both hisoka 's and killua 's fighting style as well as why hisoka knows that a fight with killua could play against hisoka 's combat weaknesses .
i would love to have a discussion as hisoka for me is one of the most complex characters in hunter x hunter .
for this analysis i will be sticking with the manga where hisoka tells killua 's brother illumi that he wants to sleep with killua and not kill him like in the anime .
only once in the show do we see hisoka enter a fight that he admits to not properly strategising .
hisoka favors fights with people he can play mind games with .
hisoka knew he could not do this with killua .
why killua has also been known to play mind games with his opponents .
however when killua goes into assassin mode he only focuses on killing his opponent as quickly as possible and this makes him impervious to mind games .
hisoka knowing the zoldyak family knows this and does not wish to engage with someone he can not mentally toy with .
killua is one of the fastest characters both in speed and reaction time in the show .
we 've seen hisoka take major damage in multiple fights and we 've seen how he uses speed to quickly assassinate his enemies .
hisoka knows that killua would only attack hisoka 's head and vital areas
why killua has killed so many enemies by removing their heads .
hisoka has been in two fights where he used the destruction of his limbs as a defense even tricking the enemy into thinking hisoka is dead .
this trick would never work with killua who as killua does goes straight for the head .
hisoka does not want to be targeted by illumi or any of the other zoldyck .
why hisoka knew that killua 's brother was in the hunter examination and knew that making enemies with the zoldyck family would surely mean hisoka 's death as we 've seen two members of the zoldyck family defeat someone who was able to beat hisoka .
i just wanted to get this theory out of my head and onto somewhere that people can give their opinions .
6.5 and 5 games behind the 1st and 2nd seed respectively they 're likely to finish no higher than 3rd-4th .
they finished last year 26-26 if they keep that pace for the rest of the season they stay 2 games above the 8th seed in 5th .
however with the bucks new coach thon becoming a superstar parker return and 76ers strength of schedule likely trending up how low can they realistically go ?
if lebron misses time and the pistons/knicks start winning is it possible they miss the playoffs entirely ?
let me start this by saying that i want to apologize for not hitting the right tone in the last 2 days .
it was a frustrating situation for us and that impacted how i talked about it more than it should have .
while there might be the perception of me being a guy in a suit sitting somewhere out of touch with what is going on i have worked in esports for 15 years and have always had its further growth and success in mind which in this case was not achieved and which therefore has been a source of personal frustration .
you as the community have every right to be equally frustrated at the situation and our handling of it .
second let me to apologize on behalf of esl and facebook for the issues you 've experienced throughout the start of our esl one genting broadcast .
the technical issues should not have happened and the fact that the viewing experience on the facebook platform is not yet where they or us want it to be is clear from the feedback you 've given .
it is something everyone involved has been working on around the clock but obviously that is not enough at this point .
we 've already been compiling your feedback from the other reddit threads and are building a roadmap of the work that is ahead of us and any feedback left in this thread will definitely heard .
johannes runs our social media department and works closely with the different platforms on the user experience and community side and will make sure that you are heard
i currently own a grey shirt and a pair of tan jeans .
i saw that their price crashed heavily since the start of the year .
should i hold onto them or trade/sell them asap ?
this is not a glitch and maybe you did know this but i landed at the police station outside of yp and was dead center circle .
i was killing some time and tried to see if i could interact with the stall doors .
then i tried to climb over them and to my surprise you hop right into them and stand on the toilet if you crouch you are completely hidden .
i 'm not sure how useful this is but it 's a good place to hide if multiple people drop there and get a gun before you i guess .
besides all the typical rbn life-ruining stuff she 's done nmom it seems her response to me setting healthy boundaries was to perjure up a dv tro to instantly make me homeless .
so recently this play has been gaining a lot of moment mainly from dubby running it .
i was wondering if anyone has any tips of shutting it down .
i know that corner route is a cover 3 killer and if they run double drags it gets rough with cover 2 .

i currently have 15k in my acorns on aggressive .
i want to deposit another 20k next week that has been sitting away in a untouchable bank account .
i understand dollar cost averaging and wanted others opinions on whether i should deposit the entire amount and begin earning interest inmediately or dollar cost average to invest this 20k .

also plan on buying a house in the next 1 2 years so am not looking to invest in etf 's individually .
switching apps from the bottom of the screen is n't always most efficient for my fingers .
i see no reason for every 3d touch-enabled iphone to have 3d touch app switching except for the iphone x .

trying to take advantage the dell update catalog in scup so we can deploy those updates with sccm .
however when we do publish them they never show as required or installed in sccm .
i have tried talking to dell and microsoft and we are getting nowhere .

i think we might have a top ten coin here ...

he looks like a fucking nerd out of a mongoloid cartoon in this picture
mccree is in a good spot i ca n't deny that .
if he has a good aim he can do a damn good job and is a great as an anti-flanker .
however it is plenty of times when soldier is just a better overrall pick .
soldier can kill flankers pretty quick with his rockets and he can get into the battle faster with his sprint .
not to mention that he can heal his team and his ult does n't get shut down by sombra and he have a faster reload time i think .
i believe something that can really bring him on par with soldier is a passive abilty just like everyone in blackwatch do .
it makes since for everyone in blackwatch to have a passive since they were basically the people that had an ace in the hole .
i saw three passives that i thought was great for him .
bounty hunter mccree deals slightly more damage to heroes who are on fire
i 've made posts in the past to ask did i balance it out or not and yeah it was mostly negative feedback .

people do n't grow into maturity in our world .
over the course of a couple minutes you go through the entirety of puberty .

you 're only allowed to have one pill in your lifetime .
after you finish your pill puberty subsequent pills wo n't work .
but you and i somehow got three pills a piece .
we 're going to take them all at the same time .
i still kinda want to be able to see my family tree !

i am a offshore engineering major with a low grade point average 2.444 .
the reason my grade point average is so low is that i was sick for 2-3 years and almost had to drop out of college .
i have become healthier in that past few months and i think the worst is behind me .
i have done well on all of my group projects with only one not being an a .
if y'all have any advice or recommendations as i do n't really know where to even start .
also many of the companies i have looked at so far require a minimum grade point average .
i will also be attending the carrier fair tomorrow so if y'all have any ideas or tips that would be very helpful .
for those who aim for both i 'm interested in what you all do in the areas where minimalism and zero waste https www.reddit.com/r/zerowaste are somewhat at odds .
i see this as a potential issue in a few specific situations and sometimes it just seems like aiming for zero waste requires having more stuff .
i 'm trying to move toward a more minimal and less wasteful lifestyle but i have so much crap to purge .
sure i can recycle and donate but there 's a lot that i feel just needs to go in the garbage and the sooner the less weight on my mind .
but then i try to think of ways to not just throw it away so i end of storing it for longer .
also while moving more toward reusable and less waste i find that sometimes i need more things and need to carry them around with me reusable grocery bags reusable container in my purse for resturant leftovers etc .
it seems a lot of people who move toward zero waste start to diy things and that requires more supplies and storing more items .
i guess this might be one of those situations where if doing this adds value to your life then it 's worth it but it seems like a slippery slope of just keeping things around .
if you 're the type that likes videos she kinda describes what i 'm talking about here when minimalism and zero waste clash https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ktnsbyl2dms .
i want to know a lot more about the first order and why canto blight matters .
need at least 10 hours for all of that .
could make an episode about the war before ever starting with rey the stuff on jakku for the second hour and maybe mix all the characters in each episode for the remaining 8 .
it would n't be so flashy as a movie trilogy but it is a cost i 'd be willing to pay .
so my wife got a call from the school my son was at the nurses office and needed to be picked up from school .
the nurse said he was a little lethargic and cold/clammy and that we should monitor him for head injury symptoms .
my wife took him to the clinic where they said he had a concussion .
he has bruises on half his face/head and he is acting goofy goofier than normal for a 5 year old
apparently because of severe cold they were having indoor recess in the school gymnasium where he was either putting away or taking out a game from a big cabinet in the gym when it fell on him .
the staff that was monitoring the students during recess did not actually see it happen so they did n't know th exact cause but that they thought it was secured to the wall or that it was supposed to be .
the clinic said to monitor his behavior for the next day or two to see if he is getting better or worse concussion symptoms and to come back if he does n't improve or gets worse .
what if he has brain damage as a result or has developmental issues because of a head injury ?
it 's just day 3 and i 'm doing ok so far .
but i 've seen too much porn over the years that i do not need to watch anymore .
my brain simply plays random scenes from all those porn videos and because of this constant battle between my thoughts drifting away and me trying to bring it back i 'm finding it very difficult to concentrate on anything .
at around day 10-15 even though i could somewhat resist masturbation i end up breaking the nofap challenge just because i need to concentrate in class while studying etc .
i tried to do a kyogre raid at 6:15 .
there were about 16 people i was in the lobby like everybody else .
once the raid began my game got stuck on the go '' screen .
it sat there for about an entire minute while everybody was saying that it would catch up—except it did not .
again everybody else said i would be let back in to catch the kyogre because i was already in the lobby .
except this time i got another error there was an error rejoining a raid 33
and i was not let back in to catch kyogre .
thought i got a second chance when a second group showed up five minutes later and then—the same exact things happened again to a t same network error same phone automatically restarting after the error same error rejoining the raid and same not let in to catch kyogre .
and by the time that the second raid was done kyogre only have five minutes left on her and nobody else is going to raid now .
i did not have any problems with the exclusive raid just an hour prior just two blocks away only the kyogre raid .
and since it was 7 pm by the end of all this raids were done for the day .
has anybody else ran into this crashing/phone restarting problem with kyogre raids .
i finally got an mdr drop based ge cache that has competent brutal and the unique weapon talent .
which talent should i re-roll between competent and brutal ?
and consider that i 'd want to try and use the mdr in a sentry set tactician set or firecrest set .
so i 've had my ph-1 for a couple of months now and everything has been going great until a couple of nights ago when i had my battery at 90 before sleeping and it was dead the next morning about 7 hours later .
i have wifi turned off and my work slack notifications are always off at night .
anyone else having this problem and know how i might fix it ?
i actually did n't notice until now but why does literally every defuse map have 2 bombsites ?
you could say that 1 bombsite would be too boring or it would be unfair but if you rebalanced the cover to be suitable for a 5v5 instead of a 2v5 with ct rotates or if you added flank routs would just 1 bombsite be that bad ?
i guess that probably is too many for a 5v5 gamemode since the cts could end up in a 1v5 on one bombsite and stacking one bombsite would be incredibly unfair if it works .
does anybody have the time to visit the tezos home page and cut and paste your public key to check if you still have your tezos in the tezos vault ? ''
i used to be able to check and see my tokens but now i get an error message error checksum mismatch . ''
i found one post like mine dated way last year and at that time my checking attempts produced perfect results .
so is this a problem that is spreading or is it that i missed some thing that i should know .

it was dark out 3 am in the morning to be more specific .
a man wearing all black entered an alleyway large expensive trenchcoat trailing behind him hat at least twice the size of his head standing poised on his head obstructing his face .
another followed this one donned a barely maintained hoodie pants equally as broken down .
her entire face seemed to droop down the red that spread out under her baggy eyes was only color visible on her paper-pale skin .
they glanced forth to the right to the left and began walking in sync quickening their pace as nothing responded to their nervous peeks eventually facing one another as stopped halfway through the alley .
a man wearing heavy looking body armor watched from the rooftops peering down into the alley as the man in black reached into his coat taking out a plastic bag filled to the brim with white powder .
he seems to have a lot of it too .
for the briefest moment the world 80 meters around froze .
flickering from the black orange and yellow that made up the alley to a series of greys and whites reverting back as fast as it appeared .
nothing seemed to have changed the same old pieces of garbage lay spread on the floor the same old dumpster sat to the building across the same old downtrodden road stretched just shy of the entrance .
now behind the man in black was another what seemed like a metal pipe in his hand sharp buzz emanating from it as tiny arcs of electricity bounced about indiscriminately .
a strangled scream ripped out the alley stopping abruptly as the man in black fell ...

she shared some great stories about sneaking into clubs to dance why she used to hate drag shows until she was in one and the outfit that outed her to her mom .
we also talked about the moment she got the call that she was on drag race and how she would cry every night that they were shooting season 8 .

i see this spammed in teh reddit lobby chat a lot .
i do n't feel like it is a dead game and i do n't see the same players over and over .
i did a search and there was nothing really recent about this and was just hoping for some insight .
so i currently have a gtx 960 2gb which is enough to do the job but with textures getting huge nowadays i need something with a bit more oomf .
what would potentially be a good upgrade for under £200 or 300 ?
im searching for good headphones at a cheaper price range and narrowed it down to these 2 also the turtle beach xo three is basically the same so it could also be turtle beach xo three vs hyperx cloud stinger anyways yeah i really need opinions on this as i have no idea which one sounds and feels better and which mic is better thanks in advanced and sorry for this really long text lol .
time to put some order here i will aprove all post as long as there 's no spam and attempts at political talk .

i have been loving sea of thieves but my girlfriend and i were taking turns to play it because we only have 1 xbox one and the game sadly does n't have split-screen .
i then saw a post from rare that said if we have the beta we can play the game on either pc or xbox one via the xbox play anywhere program .
i thought this was cool but i have a really bad pc for playing games so i thought i 'd rather just stick to xbox and i only had 1 beta key so i assumed it was locked to my account on xbox but then i thought maybe any profile on my xbox can play the beta as long as the xbox is registered as my home xbox .
so she logged in on her own profile booted up the beta and i downloaded the game on my pc .
we were able to play together in the same room !
i lowered the resolution and graphics settings on my pc and the game ran perfectly smooth on a laptop with only 1gb of vram .
i miss split-screen gaming but at least i have another way to play sea of thieves locally with a friend now !
tl dr sea of thieves beta can be played from any account on your home xbox one and from your account on pc so you can play with a friend of yours locally !
howdy i 'm jeremy frye and for a quick background i have been playing competitive magic for around 8 years and won gp santa clara with my team a few weeks back .
i wrote a tournament report about my team 's top 8 this past weekend of the scg dallas team open .
i played a personal favorite deck of mine krark-clan ironworks combo in the modern seat for our team .
i did my best to take detailed notes of what happened during my games in the event and tried to figure out if i could have played better .
my team ended the event with a record of 12-4 while my personal record was 11-5 .
you can find my report in the link below .
this is my first tournament report so i 'm open to constructive criticism or any discussion over my deck and plays .
does anyone have any idea what the pounds per cubic foot are for any parts of this mattress ?
i 'm in need of something soon the twin i have started digging into my back with the springs .
i do n't really want to jump on a purchase but this has great reviews on amazon though i 'm over 200 lbs .
and i 'm not sure it will be a worthwhile purchase .
i am trying to design some rules around how different sizes react .
anyone have any systems like this they have instituted i.e .
small mediums large collosus ... and how those sizes effect how they have to fight and roleplay vs other sized players .
what you do n't know is that i was alone at home when it happened i could n't breathe and i was having a panic attack .
what you do n't know is that i tried to call my mom three four five times to tell her i was going to the hospital what you do n't know is that my brother was n't home and i had no way of contacting him because i had the phone what you do n't know is that he had to come home to find his sister not there .
what you do n't know is that my heart rate kept climbing and climbing in the ambulance i was terrified .
what you do n't know is that they kept me in the e.r for almost ten hours .
what you do n't know is that i was alone and i was scared my mom eventually came to my side but she had to leave .
what you do n't know is that while i lay in that bed i felt like my father alone and sick .
i remembered that he died in his hospital bed alone alone completely alone .
what you do n't know is that when i came home i did n't feel like i belonged there it was wrong it was all wrong i do n't have dreams but i know they 'd all be of the hospital .
but you you really think i would lie about something so horrific ?
i ca n't even imagine what nonsense goes through your head in order for you to think that way about me someone you called a friend .
what you do n't know is that i 'm still terrified to talk about what happened and some of it i do n't even remember .
this was as many others would agree with me the last good version of starbound before a huge portion of the backers quit the game .
this was the version where the lore started getting babyfied game mechanics ripped out in bulk and the game made into a single exact experience with 0 replayability .
it used to be on steam depos but i ca n't find the steam depo ids to download it via steam console .
anyone know a way i can get the old versions ?
maybe the developers would like to give out a copy of the older version i actually paid for .
in retrospect of writing this i expect these three things will happen
the old versions have intellectual property belonging to awesome people who were fired because they were too awesome for cf so the old content can no longer be legally distributed by cf and on here nobody 's allowed to distribute that content .
i have a website with lots of maps for games https tarkov.directory
is there some library to have an image viewer that would suit for that ?
my screen has recently started changing brightness at random .
it will suddenly start getting dim then after a while come back to normal .
the interval seems to be random sometimes taking a few minutes between the dimming sometimes longer .
i have a desktop running windows 7 with an lg monitor which i unfortunately lost the papers for so not sure about the model .
most guides i 've come across talked about smartphones or laptops and said to check power settings display for auto dimming .
i checked it my energy plan is high efficiency and the display settings only have a setting for the time after which the monitor should turn off .
3 days ago i think it was after i accidentaly checked reset '' in my monitor menu the one accessed by buttons on the monitor sitself
what i 've tried so far to resolve the issue
look up guides on the internet and looked into power setttings looked into the monitor menu .

i posted this on a request on r/dndhomebrew so i figured i might as well post it here as well .
intended as an ideal weapon for both bards and warlocks in my campaign it was used by a bard archfey who was a pc warlock 's patron and gifted to said pc as a reward .
you gain a 2 bonus to attack and damage rolls while wielding this rapier which deals an additional 1d6 force damage on a successful hit .
while wielding mythmaker you may cast vicious mockery as an action .
when you land a killing blow with this weapon on a creature who has at least a number of hit dice equal to half your level the target must make a charisma saving throw against your spellcasting ability if any .
if the creature fails you gain 1 to your charisma score while you wield this weapon as you build legends of the weapon 's feats .
the bonus can be a maximum of 3 and reduces by 1 each week if you do not land a killing blow with mythmaker .
the bonus is reset if another creature attunes to the weapon .

unfortunately shipping is very expensive if you do n't hit the 125 minimum .
cardhaus wo n't hold or combine orders during big sales either .
copied from autonomous cars and you can basically sack the drivers .
realistically given the competition that will be incoming from robotaxis over the coming decade and if they do n't do it starting now they will end up a white elephant .
they need more frequent services at lower cost as a minimum .
all this industrial action will do is make the managers more certain to push ahead .
they are forcing monitoring technology into the cabs to make sure that drivers take regulation breaks .
it 's gon na be robots wherever possible as soon as they can get the tech certified .
a lot has changed since you were away namely the fact that barrage meta has been trash for a long time and chaining meta and total dual hand are the new hotnesses .
when maint is finished tonight there 's actually two dev banners coming that healer 5 healers and 5 supports .
putting time and effort into both of those banners would prove a great boon to your team !
lots of new espers the end of season 1 and the beginning of season 2 .
priorities for nrg should be events and then story .
events like the one we have going currently is some of the best ways to get good equipment like getting dual cast from king mog at the moment !
decent equipment comes in the story there 's a good amount of stuff that is usable up until late game and yes the best stuff comes from the trials .
in terms of difficulty i would say everything below gilgamesh is doable fairly early with decent units with gilgamesh being the first gateway to tougher content as you need to approach gilgamesh with a plan rather than just bruteforcing him like you can with the trials below him .
you 're making an association between communism and multiculturalism in order to discredit the latter when in fact no association between the two exists .
i pointed out that they both have utopian mantras which have no bearing to reality .
besides this one point i did n't insinuate any other association .

my nmother is elderly now and lives alone so she has no-one to blame the mess on her place is absolutely filthy
her excuse now is that she 's too old to do it which is n't true
when she moved she lost a lovely picture of my grandad in his army uniform and a military medal
i was wanting to take it because i knew it would disappear if it was left with her and sure enough it was lost s
he just said oh loads of stuff goes missing when you move '' but like you say the trash all went with her without getting lost
what would the equivalent of an anchor baby be ?
this is literally the only reason i was able to finish today 's contract for 5 wins ...
there 's a risk of the stock getting bought out and often time these dying companies trade below net current asset value which essentially means if you bought every share and immediately paid off all your obligations with liquid assets cash receivables inventory then you 'll still have money left over as pure profit .
keep in mind i am speaking generally here and not specifically sears .
seeing our boys try to adapt to his super aggressive high pressing style would 've been hilarious .
his bilbao and marseille teams were capable of great things before his ego alienates them .
and you should ask me because i know things .
only millennials and partisan hacks are concerned about this .
you can complain talk shit sarcasm whatever you want its the truth .
if you go seek out the discussions with actual current/former telecom managers/lawyers/labor leaders/etc they all say the same thing net neutrality wasnt necessary most of the potential horrors people are crying foul about are either already illegal still legal before/after or would be corrected in the marketplace .
so sorry for you torrentkiddies out there i really am .
my internet would probably cost half as much if you little shits werent hogging all the bandwidth .

i 'm not disagreeing with wiki 's definition of two tier i 'm disagreeing with your application of the term to our current system .
two tier means that if you want any service emergent or otherwise you have a the public free '' system or the b paid out of pocket/insurance system .
right now all of our in-patient/emergent issues are public as are family physicians to my knowledge there is only one tier .
true dental could be considered two tier but you 're only eligible for public dental if you have an emergent concern which warrants going to the er .
to that end we do not have a two tier system and i 'd respectfully disagree with your liberal use of the term .
that said as you are likely aware a different sort of two tier system '' exists and is doing well in canada a doctors and relatives of doctors vs b people who have no connections to doctors who can help them bypass our system .
gopro had some really high prices focusing on marketing themselves .
in reality most people just did n't seem to realize that action cameras were being made by pretty much everbody .
let alone that the alternatives were cheaper and better .
people have been slowly figuring that out the past few years .
after some investigation the cause of this bug might be because of the visual effects of some monsters that cause the game to freeze .
we 've identified the errant monsters and for the time being has removed them from the game .
players should be able to continue playing for now .
if the trials still get stuck please report to us the type of monster you encountered .
from our side we will also continue fixing the errant monster effects .
maybe this is just my taste but i think i 'd like a little more melody even a slight one to give the tracks some direction i think your other track somewhere someplace '' has that .

if you 're open/able to wait i think it 's a much better call to wait .
so much of your chances of admission are tied to your lsat so spending time to study and improve your score can pay dividends .

i consider all naked lotions body conditioners shower gels and shower creams pointless just for the fact that i do n't have a storage solution for them that does n't involve some combination of wax paper and cling wrap neither of which are recyclable .
helping lush not use recyclable plastic that i will recycle 100 of the time by using stuff that only goes into landfill is n't helping the environment .
one thing that 's freeing about this season is that barring trixie 's insane fan base most people do n't seem too invested in any given queen winning .
a lot of these queens are competitive wildcards so i 'm more interested in seeing how things play out and just enjoying the ride .
and i say this as someone whose favorite queen ever is dela i go to most of her live shows .
i 'm mostly just happy the season 's happening at all i wo n't be screaming into the void when my fave falls victim to the inevitable rigga morris .
another thought if this season is half as good as as2 i think we will have officially passed the point where all stars seasons outshine the regular ones .
ricketts back when he was good getting hurt early in the game .
leinhart being leinhart and getting saunders red-carded in the first half .
for some reason the gloves go to the short scoring threat .
there were so many posters in that thread offering to help out op it was super heartwarming .
it 's also super sweet that u/electriccheeseburger shared the surplus they received .
the professional sports industry collapses completely while live theatre suddenly sees a massive increase in demand .
seafood restaurants and basically any place that makes seafood all go out of business .
there is a sudden increase in demand for christian end-times movies .

i would be very disappointed to hear that aph is not doing the same
while they have n't made a direct announcement the partnership with tokyo smoke tells me it it will happen
i 'd say then at least reading would mean less mistakes overall and piss off less people cause the people bitching about them taking forever would still be bitching if they took forever cause they did n't know or understand something vs knowing something and doing it fine .

because at early stages there is no champ that i know of that would have got 70 bonus armor/mr from the percent bonuses given by aftershock .
aftershock now gives you 70 bonus armor/mr at level 1 .
so sure it may have a slight damage nerf and be slightly less useful late game it is even more oppressive early game due to the raw stats .
maybe you just want too much for others and you do n't necessarily know what path is the best for that person ?

it will be heartbreaking to them as they thought that the company cared about them paying their mortgage and the food for the wife and the two little kids .

it was more like a thank god we 're staying in budget and this still looks like a wedding dress ! ''
it was a relief to have gotten it done .
i 'm not terribly gushy over the thing and have since seen other dresses that are both nicer and more me but they are also completely out of my price range so that is that .
honestly i do n't know if i have it in me to have a say yes to the dress moment .
i just rarely get that feeling with clothing period .
would love to bury my face in your ass .
the reason is says it 's down so much is bc someone messed up and forgot a zero when they tried to buy one of the first ones listed.. it 's been growing since it was announced it was being listed

everyone on here is just cognizant enough to realize that essays/ec 's are more important than people think which is why it 's discussed so much .
plus most people here do n't have much control over their stats anymore .
people who are still applying should be focusing pretty heavily on their essays .
it 's true that low stats do n't make you very competitive for harvard but at the end of the day you never know .
i 've heard too many stories of people who had low stats and got in to reach schools just because they believe adcoms fell in love with their personalities .
that makes me feel like my essays need to be perfect and if someone wants to be a competitive applicant they should feel that way too .

i 've tried googling it in my area but it just comes up with various training '' programs .

he generally stops when told i guess the more i think about it .
but it 's just so constant that it 's so much quiet '' that it 's never actually quiet .
he stops for one minute and then goes right back to a bark .

stockings and heels and glasses seems to be going over well here .
she 's got some classy wire-rim frames or some kind of vaguely retro cat-eye glasses .
but i think the nude-color thigh-highs will go over best as opposed to black or white thigh-highs .
being nude-color you can see they 're there by they do n't call any excessive attention to themselves .
kind of like wearing something sheer that you can easily see through except being there just from the thighs down you do n't even have to see through them since they do n't obscure anything important at all .

had n't really considered having him stick around as a villain .
i think my players think the campaign will/should be over by lvl 5 but that 's never going to happen at the rate they are going .

couldnt you just get a sheet protector or mattress pad instead of a whole new mattress ? !
i know you can get them for like 200 now but still the alternative would save you 150 right ? .
although urine is sterile the contents might be potent baking soda a spray bottle of apple cider vinegar would neutralize odors kill mites and what not ive heard that you 're supposed to replace your mattress due to wear an tear as well as most people usually sleep in the same spot and a regular position ... . which makes sense when i bought mine i did a shit ton of research as to which one was ultimately going to be the best for me very invested in reaching the highest naps and sleep i think i just kinda got lucky when i chose the one i did from the options i narrowed it down our ten year anniversary is coming up .

its power consumption may be higher than intended for some reason .

stereotypically speaking women from my region of china are supposedly loud bossy and rather unfeminine .

i have a similar point of view but what i try to pass along is not that everything is my son 's fault but that he can change his outlook or reactions to situations .
he only has his eyes to view the world and i get to help adjust their focus .
pwhoop pwhoop ca n't hear those lines without the swinging scythe afterwards .
there 's a lot to be said about whether chelsea are generally dependent on hazard or not but i feel like it 's a bit unfair to talk about it as a chronic problem in the context of a game where we were missing willian morata and fabregas for most of the game .
i think most teams would struggle to assert themselves if they were missing their playmaker starting striker and were playing with an out of position midfielder on the wing regardless of whether they were dependent on one player or not .
why would you pay for something if it was n't what you really wanted ?

do your research and contact gatehub for explanation before complaining and projecting your emotions .
it is still a choice though is n't it ?
a woman is under no obligation to have children or to take care of the children more than her fair share .
her partner may not want to have children if this is going to be the case but that is a choice that they make and so in that case the woman has a choice between taking care of the kid and working more .
i understand that things can get crappy if there is an unplanned child but for the most part safe sex is not that hard if you are married i think ?
you may be able to speak to that better .
there is no coercion or anything involved and i do n't think there would really be a power dynamic but maybe that 's not always true .

the subtitles feel really dull sometimes and the dub does sound quite good actually .
hey at least with something that old you could probably have installed a kit to relocate the filter and had room in the engine compartment to bolt it in .
it could be the tv itself that for some reason the rx580 has an issue with that .
being in windows looking like crap while games in fullscreen are fine sounds like there might be an issue with adapting the right resolution .
i 'd suggest to either borrow a screen from a friend or wait until next thrusday .
i ca n't say for sure because long distance diagnosing is always a bit shady but my guess would be that the screen is the issue .
i 'd just like to see more cards printed that benefit from going first .
like heavy tempo-punish ambush cards or stuff like old bear without preventing 1-strength units of triggering .
there are just way more cards that benefit from going second because of their reactive nature .
and i think that summoning circle losing the ability to copy ca-spies is long over-due .
to be fair i 'm struggling with autocorrect in all of these posts .
it tends to have a deleterious effect on the meaning of the posts .
i 'm not victim blaming anyone here i 'm saying that if crimes were committed then the state should get involved .
i 'm also saying that signing up to take part in a raunchy party must count against the charges as it were else sex would be two charges of indecent exposure sexual assault and rape .
i did n't for cps i worked with them i 'm a therapist .
that said if a child is getting removed from a home a court case was involved in that decision even an emergency removal requires a judge to sign off on it .

yeah i figured it would be something like that .
also now i knew most leases were like that i was thinking since it was student aimed apartments they would be more likely to individualize the payment .

is the v7 so popular that people just refer to generically because i have a 05 1100 california stone and always refer to year/make and model
you are assuming that these people killed by cops are all unarmed people with their hands up
police are statistically more likely to kill black men .
black men are statistically more likely to kill police .
occams razor implies that most of the killings were probably justified .
and the reason that blacks are statistically more likely to be killed by police is statistically they are more likely to shoot at police officers
the evidence points to justified shootings rather than racist police officers killing unarmed innocent gentle giants like mike brown
hence saying 30 of the people shot by police are black men despite 12 of pop being black this must be evidence of racism is fake news
they gave those out awhile ago haha enjoy the currency

it 's not perfect but i do like it for the price .
it seems as long as you let him have full autonomy of the offense it 'll be ok .
i think the reason he left pitt was because lsu lured him away .
then he butted heads with coach o and it was obvious .
so i do n't know who made the decision at lsu to hire him but it was n't a good mix to put a new school coordinator with an old school coach .

if i 'm swinging my cast iron that hard there will definitely be someone 's head on the other end .
i just do n't like low effort comments based solely on some weird brand specific crusade .
i was talking specifically about the beatsx which by the way are fairly new and were designed by apple after the beats acquisition .
they have decent sound quality great battery life and seamless wireless integration across apple devices .
they are a simple and functional set of wireless earbuds .
they work great for me and i wholeheartedly recommend them .
if you want to focus solely on brand names go ahead i guess but that seems pretty reductionist .
for the record i would n't use a pair of solo beats if you paid me to but i stand by the beatsx .
i think that is an entirely different dynamic because it is n't about how different people parse the same stimuli differently but the fact that different people have to navigate entirely different environments their entire adult lives .
i would say that there is a lot of truth to the perception that conventionally attractive women are generally inaccessible to the majority of men who would be interested the bombardment of attention and ploys from interested parties requires them to create shields and to take for granted that many people will be very friendly but ultimately disingenuous or dangerously possessive and/or jealous .
but to get back to your question about drawing a connection to a diverged perspective yeah i could see how people from those two overlapping environments would not have a shared sense of reality '' which could make relating to each other very difficult .
ps for your specific situation and the fact that you 're broke i 'd suggest you investigate purchasing a box in vinales .
there are perfectly good rollers using real tobacco there you can easily meet a few in town and when touring around the countryside .
it might be fun to take lots of photos of him rolling then handing a box over to you for your party .
they 're very affordable too much cheaper than buying real '' branded cigars .
you can take one undocumented box out of the country with no hassles so you can ignore the aduana export regulations requiring an official receipt .

he is now taking medication for it which has almost completely stopped them .
do n't use the bad teammates narrative when the same shit applies to bron .
'park orchards service centre ' on oban rd ringwood is well regarded in my area .
my folks have had their new and very old cars serviced there for about 30 years .
the game is free anyway so you have no right to cry about a broken game .
you 're probably garbage so my only advice you is to get gud .
yeah its at the end of the second ss3 when boss does his water splash or wave slash .
in your video though he is doing the water splash and you dont get hit ... ..i cant replicate that and it kinda ticks me off xd
edit ok forget what i said i actially saw the wrong attack in your video xd
but just from stat numbers i should be faster . the missing last 4 ability on titania are worth roighly 80 pointe of attack/crit that im missing there
the missing r5 armor in alice is worth 400-500 attack that i dont have ... .
but my r5 on rain gives me a good 900 attack and 1200 crit more .
so if its like this it seems like im only missing the title for better time ... ..or maybe some more crits .
this guy knows that 210 rounds is a combat load .
me and my friends were joking the other day that they should add just an scii zerg player as a hero who builds hatcheries and expands and builds mutas and stuff
i 'm mostly thinking in terms of high tech e.g. when a company develops a system it can choose to try to lower the cost and achieve high volume or it can optimize as for very powerful luxury applications .
the ford example does n't sound to me like what you 're trying to get at before ford 's innovation mass production did n't exist .
automobile producers were n't making a decision to produce few luxury cars instead of a lot of cheap cars they did n't have the option to produce cheap cars at all because they did n't have the technology to mass produce vehicles .
would have to be careful not to ruin it .
i 'm betting that the valentine 's event is going to either a raid or another exploration event to start on the 9th while cny will either an exploration like last year or a km grinder that starts on the 16th .
that would mean that we may actually get cg sakura next friday then .
best case scenario we still do ffix at the end of feb. and gl events do something good again .
is either that or garnet getting shafted ... again .
it holds up to 1liter and it is a mixture of water protein estrogen and testosterone .
are you really being objectified if you 're chasing the chasers ?
i wan na lick and suck that nice wet pussy before i fill it deep .
i live 15 minutes away in south san francisco looking forward to visiting the area for more than just ramen !
and maybe a book in case i run into you and ask for a signature .
sometimes there is only so much you can do .
if todoroki uses his ice as often as his fire or more the air will cool and inasa can use his wind again .
slightly unrelated but i never had a wii u and just got a switch .
does anyone know if they have any plans to remake/rerelease any games from the paper mario series ?
i played thousand-year door and super paper mario as a kid was deeply saddened by sticker star and never got to play colour splash .
i would love love love to play colour splash on my switch !
we got caught with our hand in the canadian cookie jar and got a slap on the wrist .
the only real losers in that war were the native americans .
seemingly unlikely permutations of events happen constantly they are not fate magic or a sign .
if it moves around to drop troops over a base who decides which base it heads to ?
would deployables players etc be able to move along with the ship ?
third let 's say i place a spawn beacon on it but the ship is moving .
my drop pod cant keep up and i fall in the middle of nowhere .
its pretty balance to me it depends on your playstyle .
ijn is flexible more squadron for baiting while usn is more of a d ! ck less squad but those squads pack a real punch .
would you say they are taking the time to make the most polished and content driven game they can ?
or the development of the game is in a bad state due to ea pulling the strings on a game as service model ?
i typically cum after 15 to 30 minutes or sometimes longer do something else online for a minute then realize i 'm not finished masturbating browse back to porn and go for one or two more orgasms .
surströmming pronounced ²sʉːˌʂʈrœmːɪŋ swedish for sour herring '' is a type of fermented baltic sea herring .
the baltic herring known as strömming in swedish is smaller than the atlantic herring found in the north sea .
traditionally the definition of strömming is herring fished in the brackish waters of the baltic north of the kalmar strait '' .
the herring used for surströmming are caught just prior to spawning .
when was the last time alliance got a horse mount that was tied to pvp/class ?
this is nice for people that do n't pvp much or do n't play paladin/warlock .
if this is how you 're gon na use it i really recommend you play with it more !
stumbled into this sub from r/all but like does anyone actually jack it to ddlc ?
that game made my dick go inside like a turtle
you need to consider the fact that you have a d3300 which is a very light weight camera .
it 's main strength is good quality for its size .
do n't ruin it by putting a very heavy lens on it .
it is very light very cheap and has vr .
keep in mind that only rarely will you shoot at wide apertures with the tokina .
with a wide angle lens the corners are not sharp until higher apertures like f8 .
i used to have the nikon 10-24 when i had dx d40 and i got the nikon 18-35 when i switched to fx .
they are pretty much the same lens but 10mm is a bit wider on dx vs 18 on fx .
based on my experience i would choose the wider lens .
the 10-24 was probably too heavy for the d40 and i think you 'd find it to be the same with your camera .
yeah when nixon gave that speech 69 only people younger than 25 or so would even be considered baby boomers .
he was referring mostly to the silent generation not the greatest generation or baby boomers .
however the back end of the baby boomer generation born late 50's/early 60 's was more conservative .
they voted in favor of republicans in 72 76,80,84 and 88
the closest blink chargers to me are all at carl 's jr locations and the one closest to me often the employees are the ones parked in the blink charger spots even though there are plenty of other spaces close to the building .
the blink chargers i 've used have all been slower than competing networks ' stations as well usually only charging our cars at about 4-5 kw while everywhere else we get 5.8-6.2 kw on average .
they are also often broken either they ca n't read the rfid card or the screen is unresponsive .
nothing changed congress kept stooges in every places it can so they be useful as situation arrives .
how can you expect her to find them all ?
i think motley will be a better version of powell sometime down the line too excited to see him get some more time later on in the year hopefully .
that must be why we need 5 of them lol
and what did following all the rules get him ?
it led to compromise after compromise he was willing to cut social security for god 's sake !
and for all his efforts to cultivate goodwill with republicans they continuously rebuffed him .
sure it 's truly terrible shit but they recognize that policy is important not decorum and norms .
if norms '' means hemming and hawing and subsidizing the financial industry and fucking over foreclosed people like obama 's stimulus '' did those norms are n't worth shit .
if your norms get in the way of improving the quality of life of your constituents why even pretend to be a political party if you 're just going to claim your hands are tied even when you 're in complete control ?
i use skullcandy ink 'd they 're the best sound for the cheapest price i can find
i think i 've seen a few comments that try to down play shanghai 's map victory .
he probably watches it at 4 am when he 's in the gym clanging and banging .
120 application cost assuming no waver vs. years of wondering if you should have tried ...
i think that adds up to go for it !
may as well throw in the naked man in there .
there 's no reason for it your body parts just get shitty .
you will want to have sex but your body wo n't .
when you hit your late twenties the growth will show up .
it 's imperative that you do n't touch it or it might rupture .
just ignore it bear through the discomfort and it 'll go away eventually .
i think the eyes only look weird because the left eyebrow is completely hidden in shadow and it loses symmetry .
but i 'm generally easily impressed so do n't take my word for it haha

regardless of whether your work may be considered a cover song or separate musical composition ... if you are including elements of another musical composition in your work then you need to obtain the mechanical rights to do so before manufacturing and selling/distributing copies of your music .
the difference is that if you are only producing a cover song with no significant alterations to the melody/lyrics then you may qualify for a compulsory mechanical license in the us .
that basically just means you may have the right to produce and sell reproductions of the music even if the songwriter/rightsholder does n't want you to as long as you agree to pay the statutory royalty rate and follow the terms of the compulsory license .
if however you are making significant alterations to the melody or lyrics or you are creating your own musical composition that includes some elements copied from another musical composition then you need to custom negotiate mechanical rights with the rights holder s of the song s which you are basing your work off of .
in other words you wo n't qualify for a compulsory mechanical license in such cases—you have to seek explicit permission from the rightsholder s and they are free to reject your request in which case you are prohibited from incorporating elements from that musical composition into your new composition .
in your case it sounds like you already have explicit permission from the rightsholder of the musical composition so this should n't be an issue .
broadly speaking though unless your song is entirely your own composition then you need to obtain the appropriate mechanical rights/permissions before you start producing and distributing copies of your music .
there are rare exceptions such as in cases where you include elements of another song in your song for the purpose of essentially mocking the other song and parodying it .
another exception may be if your song is only loosely inspired by the other song but you do n't directly copy any elements of the song .
in almost all other cases though if you 're incorporating elements from someone else 's song into your work then you need to obtain the appropriate rights/permissions .
so then it becomes a question of whether you qualify for a compulsory license or not .
edit 1 just to be clear if the rightsholder of the musical composition explicitly allows you to manufacture and distribute copies of your music/recording featuring their composition without paying a mechanical royalty then you do not need to pay a mechanical royalty .
you only need to pay a mechanical royalty in cases where you have acquired a compulsory mechanical license or in cases where you have custom negotiated reproduction rights and the rights holder is requesting/demanding that you pay a mechanical royalty as part of the contractual arrangement you have .
edit 2 if you helped write the song melody/lyrics together with the songwriter then it may be possible to claim that it 's a joint work with joint copyright ownership and shared rights to mechanical royalties .
however if the songwriter created the song melody/lyrics independently and then you later add to or modify the song for your recording then this is generally not going to be considered a joint work especially if the songwriter has already published the song/composition in some form .
in order to claim the work is of joint authorship you 'd basically have to be able to show that the intention was for both of your contributions to be integrated together to become parts of an inseparable whole .
once you start talking in terms of having two different versions of the song the original songwriter 's version and your version then it 's hard to argue that it 's a work of joint authorship .
is this not just a filter applied to a photo ?

my mom fed the four of us kids bean burritos on the regular .
just tortillas refried beans and a smattering of cheese .
i enjoyed it but always acted extra happy when it was served to because as the oldest i could tell my mom was sometimes sad or anxious to serve it and i wanted to encourage my younger siblings to like it .
i did n't realize why until much later and i realized she wished she was able to make us something else .
cursed bite can be bought from barroch if you do the quest for 3 cursed dragon horns .
you do n't have to be cheap to beat him i 've beaten him dozens of times without periapts etc .
but an enchanted weapon without periapts just sucks against high defense enemies you need a pure physical one to pull it off without the cheese .
yeah hallowed invocation is useless like most level 3 skills use a barbed nails instead of that silly ring/band .
i finished the show about a month ago and ever since i never fully understood how the ending was sad .
the only sad thing was the fact that it was ending and that i liked it .
since my friend wanted me to screen share my reaction while watching i had to fake tears .
i just do n't get it i really wan na understand what it meant .
a girl said vodka makes her horny but others just make her sleepy .
is there something in the formula that causes it ?

the other day one of my online friends lets call him apple i would on and off play ow with join our group while we were already in a blizzard world match we backed out so we could play comp .
we loaded up a comp game and right off the back one of the random three stacks we got paired with goes ana and apple loses his shit over the ana pick automatically locked doomfist a hero he does n't play and starts going about her win all hope is lost no point of trying the game is already over with and starts harassing the other 3 stack the whole defend part of the first 1/2 until they finally mute him .
fast forward to the end of the game where the potg is showing i send the three stack a message to please report apple alongside me .
after we went back to main menu i get a message that a player i reported was dealt with and he started going off about it on group chat .
i backed out of the group and removed him from my friends list .
being toxic and harassing people over their picks and mains is not okay i encourage people to do the same with their toxic ow friends .
tldr reported my toxic friend for harassing random 3 stack teammates over their ana pick he got banned .
i have a few questions in regards to the etiquette of smoking in south korea .
i 'm korean but born in new zealand and do n't really identify myself as fully korean but rather a kiwi .
i 'm 19 20 in korean age female and started smoking in new zealand a little while ago .
i 've done some research and found that smoking is really looked down upon and there are such heavy bans on the streets and public places .
i 'm currently in 경주 or gyeoung ju a small city in the more country side of south korea before i go to 평창 or pyeoungchang to volunteer for the winter olympics .
could someone help me find some acceptable places to smoke ?
i know the risks and all but i 've traveled all the way to korea by myself and it 's a bit stressful so i 'd like to indulge in a cigarette or two .
i feel like if i looked stereotypically european maybe the locals would n't give me such harsh looks to me but because both my parents are korean i look like a disrespectful korean female teenager who has no regards for etiquette .
would i be able to smoke during the winter olympics in pyeongchang ?
and where should i find a place to smoke in gyeoung ju ?
any suggestions for a place with a smoking room ?
i 'm sure there many good movies buried deep in the lists .
wonder if there are any sites where i can find titles based on imdb ratings .
the entire media being owned by five large corporations .

the slave markets in libya still have n't been acknowledged by the media as far as i know .
5. well there were leaked some audios from the brazil 's president being openly corrupt .
it was some months ago and he still in the presidency
it 's a mutant strain that is spread via oral sex and is thus far not able to be cured except with extremely powerful still-being-developed antibiotics .
on july 23rd 2012 a coronal mass ejection crossed earth 's orbit .
it would have taken out most of our electronics worldwide and taken us up to 10 years to recover .
bear in mind electronics means everything from reddit and tv to our power and water supplies .
i have bought some extra tins of beans just in case .
edit to many grab more attention the stuff in soil that crops and plants need to grow is going bye bye .
penicillin and many anti bacterial treatments are losing much of their effectiveness and will eventually be completely ineffectual .
the potential for honey bee and other pollinator species going extinct .
this has catastrophic implications for life as we know it .
human activity is suspected to be the main cause .
why most college kids are going through insane levels of depression ... more than half of the classmates i talk to are on some form of antidepressant
paracetamol is the number one reason for active liver failure .
something that i personally think no one is really talking about is how in the states the education system is woefully outdated .
the modern education system does n't do much to promote critical thinking skills .
standardized tests that decide funding are the norm and teachers just teach to those tests so students just memorize some things here and there .
there needs to be a complete revamp of the system the current one was designed in the 20th century for the 20th century .
but it needs to be designed in the 21st century for the 21st century .
focus needs to be put on interpreting and processing massive amounts of information understanding concepts and not formulas basic logic classes to point out inherent flaws in arguments basic programming should be a class offered in all high schools nowadays and god dammit a fucking basic journalism course to combat propaganda coming at us from all sides .
navigating the wealth of information out there without these skills being taught is like trying find your way around the pacific ocean on a canoe without an oar .
the way we think about education needs to change or society will begin to stagnate .
eta to the people blaming the problems with the education system on the side that you do n't agree with thanks for proving my point .
it 's the 1 who cause dissension in our ranks .
while we are all calling each other names and protesting each other they 're laughing all the way to the bank paying people to do their bidding passing legislation that hurts all of us but fattens their pockets .
and people like you and me republican democrat black white conservative liberal gay straight are getting fucked over repeatedly .
we need to stop fighting with each other and focus our frustrations where they can benefit all of us .
there are 325 million angry people in this country and that terrifies the establishment but our anger is misplaced .
the truth is most republicans are n't white supremacists and most democrats are n't ultra liberals who are so wrapped up in political correctness that they say nothing of value for fear of insulting somebody .
most of us just want to live and let live .
can you imagine the change we could enact if 325 million people said enough ?
i 'm talking about things like 12,000 insurance policies with 7,500 deductibles that still do n't cover jack .
if we all said fuck it and refused to purchase health insurance the system would collapse on itself and would force change .
if we all ordered our medications from canada for a fraction of what we pay here the system would collapse .
if we all refused perdue drugs in protest of them flooding the market with oxycodone and decimating our population perdue would collapse .
i use health care as an example but it applies everywhere .
there are bigger things at play here than our personal feelings .
edit i had the phrase wake up sheeple '' in here .
people with sensitive proclivities took it very personal so i took it out so as not to distract the feeble minded from my overall sentiment .
education and healthcare costs are spiraling out of reach of the common man .
do n't know if anyone else has mentioned it yet but elsagate .
you know how really young kinds like those mindless videos ?
think something in the style of teletubbies no plot no dialogue really just bright colours and characters bopping around .
there 's a whole wealth of these kinds of videos on youtube .
parents can use youtube kids an app to make sure their children are watching appropriate content .
but someone or some people or something is making these mysterious videos in the style of mindless children 's entertainment except the content is super dark .
they usually feature popular kids characters spiderman the minions mickey mouse or elsa hence the elsagate '' moniker .
the cartoons will feature these characters doing all sorts of bizarre things like getting drunk and cutting their heads open or peeing in the bathtub .
other examples include having teeth pulled having needles being kidnapped .
besides the cartoons there are also really disturbing live action videos including this one where a kid is subjected to needles in her bum .
she clearly does n't want this and her parents are exploiting her for youtube views .
could be a way to exploit algorithms rack up views and make money .
some people think it 's some kind of coded child pornography catalogue where the videos are some kind of preview for the actual content you 'll see in the real video .
some people think it 's some kind of way to groom children .
anyway it 's really disturbing and i 'm fascinated and confused .
19. the us is actively aiding saudi bombings of yemen and they target pretty indiscriminately no one in the media wants to mention that .
the australian government is seriously considering letting oil companies drill for oil in the great australian bight .
85 of the species found in the bight are literally only found there .
36 different types of whales and dolphins live in the bight with their breeding grounds in the bight as well .
its the heart of the australian fishing industry so byebye quite a bit of fish if there is an oil spill .
the oil spill in mexico which was the biggest in the world happened in calm waters .
the bight is known for having some of the roughest waters in the world .
if a spill occurs in the bight it will be almost impossible to contain and will utterly fuck up the entire southern coast of australia .
so not only is australia killing the great barrier reef but we are also very close as in 2018 close in letting huge oil companies come and try their luck in the bight .
the economy is doing well the job market is solid we 're statistically very safe we continue to make good progress in medicine we 're making great progress towards renewable energy and electric vehicles technology continues to make telecommuting easier and benefiting the disabled we continue to make progress on human rights i could go on and on ...
... and yet we do n't feel safe we 're worried about jobs we do n't eat well we do n't get enough exercise we worry about having the latest iphone or console or car or house we think the country that has been plodding along improving since inception is going to hell and are killing ourselves directly or with drugs medicine food alcohol cigarettes sedentary lifestyles etc ... and we can stop but many of us do n't .

jesus christ this stuff needs to be taught in high school before children make decisions that could potentially ruin their lives just because they think going to college is the only option they have .
and currently the government is doing all it can to fuck students in the ass over student loan debt .
for instance even if you get your debt forgiven it 's treated as taxable income so it 's not actually forgiven '' just reduced at best .
also filing for bankruptcy does jack shit for student loan debt .
it 's true a lot of people successfully pay off their debt but there are a lot more people than you 'd think that are absolutely drowning in it with no hopes of ever paying it off because of interest rates .
edit but if they take out loans why do n't they expect to pay them back ? ? ? ?

alcoholism can be easily treated with naltrexone but because the patent is expired the drug companies make nearly no money from the drug so there is no reason to tell people .
also the war on drugs is a massive failure and the us desperately needs to fix it 's prison system .
seems like what 's most important is whether or not to give tax breaks to the rich currently .
if we think it 's bad that baby boomers wo n't leave their jobs imagine how bad it 'll be when gen-xers wo n't either .
it 's not reasonable to expect every american adult to save hundreds of thousands for an undetermined later date .
people have financial crises such as medical bills or being unemployed that must be addressed before any long-term saving and 2 .
it 's totally against human nature for every single person to think and plan that far in advance .
like all other developed countries we need a system that ensures retired persons can at least meet their basic food/shelter needs .
social security was intended to help with this but we always hear that we ca n't count on ss to be around .
and w desperately need people to retire so the younger generations can join the workforce .
our system of 401ks no pensions and meager social security support is a failure .
gay conversion therapy is still legal and happening in 41 u.s. states and is currently covered by medicaid .
all the plastic in the water supply seems like it 's going to cause a lot of problems .
even if they do grow it will be far less than what is needed to achieve meaningful sustainable development .
the whole idea behind economic growth is that eventually poor countries will be rich and richer countries will be richer .
this will not be the case for many many countries .
how do you deal with the reality that some places will be very poor indefinitely ?

with all this talk of mass shootings i 'd like to say this we need to realize that the vast majority of gun deaths are caused by handguns .
the handgun deaths are mainly due to gang activity .
gangs generally have power because they sell illegal drugs .
if we legalize the drugs they sell we will be taking the power away from the gang thus minimizing gun deaths .
edit i was wrong the leading cause of gun deaths is suicide .
that means we need to work to make our society more meaningful to the individual rather than ban guns and expect everyone to stop killing themselves .
my overall point is that we have to look at the cause of a problem in order to fix it .
also i was originally way off on the amount of gun deaths per day sorry !
however there are still about 100 gun deaths per day .
that 's the equivalent of a major mass shooting every single day caused primarily by handguns .
the slow death of europe and it 's culture .
i 'm not one of those 'white genoicde ' people but i do think we 'll lose certain cultures and our way of life it 'll happen slowly over the next hundred years the climate change refugee crisis will be the final nail in the coffin for europe .
mass migration from mainly muslim lands will mean they will replace us in several decades .
a lot of people are like 'ah good no more white power bla bla bla '
i doubt they 'll be happy when half of europe is under sharia law .
i guess we can kiss goodbye to lgbt rights equality for women and a slow erosion in certain rights and freedoms that we take for granted .
i try to let people know it might be a risk to let people from mena countries in but nobody gives a sht .
i do n't think it 's racist to say the majority of mena countries have backwards views .
that come from backwards cultures where gay people are exectuted there are regular forced marriages and stonings for things like adultery .
why are n't more people worried if this is what 's replacing us ?
muslims are n't shy about wanting a caliphate or sharia .
a lot of muslims hate our way of life so once their the majority here things will start to change unfortunately .
and our governments are determined to make that happen for them .

the food pyramid is complete backwards and doctors are pushing a high carb diet that is causing type 2 diabetes heart disease and so much more .
most doctors do n't study nutrition more than a semester or 2 !
at the same time the pharmacutical industry makes a lot more money pushing their medications and treatments than actually curing the disease with diet and exercise which is possible and sustainable !
cutting carbs and increasing fat not only leads to weight loss but also increased mood greater energy decreased brain fog and so much more .

however there 's no multiplayer section in the app store and the results when i search for it on google are from 8 years ago .

there 's always going to be a difference when someone is actually joking and when somebody is trying to use it as an excuse to cover up .
someone making a joke that might be perceived as racist but that 's where the humor is vs somebody tweeting i fucking hate niggers '' and then going i was just joking '' are two different things .

okay so the tutorial for performing supers is telling me to move my directional buttons in a sweeping motion from down diagonally down right then to the right and then to press a .

i try to be very careful with whom i put my trust in when it comes to game reviews since i know a lot of reviewers are in the rather nasty habit of taking money from publishers .
recently i was reading a pc gamer article and realized i had no idea whether these guys are considered legit within the community what do you guys think ?
i have two nest cams beautifully integrated in ha .
i just bought a 2nd hand dropcam and added that to my nest setup .
it shows up perfectly in my nest app but for some reason ha 's nest configurator could not discover that no entity id showed up .
i tried reconnecting my nest account tried deleting nest.conf to force reset and even tried creating another developer app none worked .
do we know if dropcams are supported via nest or are they too old to be supported in ha ?
like the title suggests i am afraid i have fallen out of love with my boyfriend .
we have been together for almost three years two years and like 8 months .
our sex life is n't exciting anymore i find myself making up excused to not have sex i find myself not being excited to go over to his apartment sometimes it just feels like we are walking through life together as people and not as two people in love with each other .
we are both about to move on to big changes in our life moving onto new careers and cities .
i still love him and i can see myself marrying him one day we both do n't want to get to that point for a few more years so that question is n't an issue yet .
i love his family and most of my friends are from my years dating him .
i am afraid that i do n't want to end things because of my love for this future i envision or because i am afraid of losing all of my friends .
i am also afraid that maybe it is just because i am young and feeling itchy in terms of relationships .
maybe it is just because i am young and horny and feel like i have fomo fear of missing out .
i just feel way too young to be feeling like this .
tl dr young and feeling like i have fallen out of love with mr .
what do i do to either keep this relationship alive or to evaluate what i need to do ?
i 'm sure all the germans in this subreddit are thinking really another ww2 question ? i know i know .
i just am curious about how the german people think of erwin rommel and other wehrmacht officer who where not nazis .
i personally admire rommel a little yes he served under a lunatic and wore the nazi uniform but the clothes do n't make the man .
just how do the german folk feel about rommel and others like him ?

lately i 've been thinking about group meditation and its alleged affects on human collective consciousness .
if we 're all creators like the law of attraction states is n't it better to send an army instead of a single warrior ?
i 'm totally intrigued by the idea of several minds uniting to attract something on someone else 's behalf .
if other people are rallying behind you saying you deserve something you might start to believe it and align with it so much faster .
i have n't really had much time to test this theory but i started a little sub about 2 days ago .

the joust had been an embarrassment that damned prince unhorsing him in a single tilt for the whole realm to see .
he 'd repay the man some day for it he 'd make him remember the name tybolt lannister .
the shame it caused him was only reinforced by his loss in the melee another shameful display he 'd need to recover from .
indeed this tourney had been a mess for him being hammered with more dread as the days went on .
however there had been one bright moment albeit the most surprising one .
he 'd not thought on it not nearly enough his mind still full of anger from the joust .
yet it had been undeniable just as how he 'd kissed her was undeniable .
tybolt was n't sure what he 'd expected from it .
it had n't felt like the kiss of any other woman nothing like it .
no it was different most likely in part of her being his cousin .
even still it was strange and that 's why he was on his way to her apartments in harrenhal .
they were nearby to his own with the room the princess had granted the lannisters and so he arrived in a quick time .
seems like the best place would be through samsung since you get 1 year of warranty for the refurbished phones .
though the price seems like a lot for used 416 and it 's currently sold out .
amazon has it https www.amazon.com/dp/b01nb1kg8u/ref=olp_product_details ? encoding=utf8 me for 349 certified refurbished but i could n't find if it has samsung 's 1 year warranty .
then there 's this one on ebay https www.ebay.com/itm/391962167399 ? var=660921372373 for 229 b grade only 30 day warranty .
i intend to use the phone for about 1.5 years .
i need a phone with a good camera and 5.2 '' screen .
i remember months ago when i played i loved to decorate my settlements with tons of items .
stuff like food on the shelves tools in the garage fans on tables and stuff like that .
problem was you 'd come back to your settlement one day to find all the stuff you so carefully placed had somehow moved downwards and clipped thru whatever surface you placed it on ruining all your hard work .
i remember this being one of the biggest complaints of the game .
now that i 'm getting back into it i 'd love to know whether i should bother to decorate my settlements in that manner .
ok you know you want to show off that stunt stick of yours .
or better yet you want to show off all five of your skate bananas .
line 'em up on the living room carpet or prop them against the closet door in your dorm and take the blurriest goddamn cell phone picture you can then post it here where nobody cares .
or maybe somebody does care and you can talk about which banana is best .
honestly though if you have a rad quiver and you want to show it off or maybe you just bought your first full set-up or you 're stoked on a new pair of goggles or whatever post 'em here .
i dropped by tesco picked up a couple of bits including two bottles of my favourite red wine .

just under a week ago my yearling children 's python escaped her cage completely my fault she was healthy a good weight strong and unusually dark for her breed snake .
the window was open so she most likely escaped outside .
i live in nt australia so her natural habitat but other children 's pythons are unusual around my area .
yesterday we found a children 's python on our step .
exact same size but not sure about markings however was lighter in colour with a yellow under belly she had a white under belly .
this snake also looks very underweight has lots of damaged scales lumps and bumps and even a kinked tail .
it also acts very strangely seems weak and limp and almost a bit wobbly and it would much rather sit in the open than go into any avaliable hide .
i offered a thawed mouse and it took it straight away its looking far better this morning .
is there anyway my snake could have deteriorated so quickly in 5 or so days that it could be this snake or have i just found a down on its luck wild snake ?
its not a aggressive in any way and has not even threatened to bite
is there a mod to give lod a dog like meeko or a stray ?
i always felt bad he could n't get the dog he wanted when there 's so many dogs in need of a good home .
so i just watched this interview kristen did on youtube she explained in that jax was gon na drop the news about rob cheating at the house welcoming party him and brittany were throwing .
from there kristen and brittany decided to tell scheana in private so jax could n't drop this truth bomb on everyone at the party .
over the years i 've felt an on and off sympathy for scheana .
sometimes i 'm on her side others not so much .
and having seen the preview clip for the next episode it really looks like she makes a scene and frenemies to enemies at brittany 's birthday party .
how about you stop bringing up the rob scandal story ?
and how about you stop making everything about you ?
i 've been rewatching some of the older episodes and finally started to notice how scheana can take anything that 's mentioned and has to vocalize how it relates to her .
if anyone has met her is she a better person in real life ?
also i 've noticed from other posts i 'm not the only one coming to find her insufferable .
long and short is that i 'm about to be single again and i 'm realizing that i have no social life .
also working end of week nights wed. night to sunday morning acquiring one is going to be interesting .
other than hanging out with coworkers what do you guys do to keep from becoming hermits ?
hey guys so i have the bike packer plus rear panniers and after a tough ride on the rainbow road in nz it seems two bits from the back have flown off .
it 's the part that keeps the top rail attached to the bag itself .

is there anywhere in nz i can find a replacement part ?
or am i going to need to use the zipties for the rest of my tour ?

this is the best tl dr i could make original http abcnews.go.com/entertainment/wirestory/imagine-net-neutrality-flame-grilled-whopper-52602474 reduced by 33 .
in the ad customers whom the restaurant says are real are told they will be charged different prices for a whopper based on speed or mbps .
and the customers grow increasingly furious in an art-imitating-life display that mocks new internet rules that have led to wide-scale protests even death threats .
there 039 s even a jab at ajit pai who heads the federal commission that voted last month to eliminate net-neutrality protections for the internet .
net neutrality is the principle that internet providers treat all web traffic equally and it 039 s pretty much how the internet has worked since its creation .
the federal communications commission last month repealed the obama-era rules giving internet service providers like verizon comcast and at t a free hand to slow or block websites and apps as they see fit or charge more for faster speeds .
last week a group of attorneys general for 21 states and the district of columbia sued to block the rules .
this week montana became the first state to bar telecommunications companies from receiving state contracts if they interfere with internet traffic or favor higher-paying sites or apps .

this is probably old news but i stumbled over another genderless emoji yesterday .
by genderless '' i mean one that does n't count towards missions that want you to use either a boy or a girl emoji .
previously i believe only the alien from toy story was genderless but i 've now discovered that bb-8 also is .
makes perfect sense i just never stopped to think about it .
are there any other genderless emojis i have n't considered ?
at raw 25 they completely skipped over the part of his career where he was biker taker and the only clip they really ever show is the john cena handshake .
any idea why they do n't want to remind people of biker taker ?
i mean its an indie studio they obv do n't have the money for big marketing campaigns like cod does .
my fear is that the community will be too small with little or small advertisement .
i played the beta and can say its a great game so far ofc there is many to improve but still probably the best game ive played in couple of years and dev 's seem to improve listen to the community but i do n't think this game is gon na be big and wonder how it could sustain over years .

notice i decided that i 'm going to put all the studio album closers as round 24 .
in other subs r/qotsa people have been doing a ‘build your own album ' type deal .
this is going to be a 24 track album .
the first round is going to be the opening tracks from each album ep excluding the night on the sun interstate 8 and blue cadet eps for the time being the second round second tracks etc .
each round will last around 1 day much like the survivors on this subreddit .
you vote for the song that you want to stay in not the one you want eliminated .
i have no idea how well this will work so i apologize in advance .
also i 'm on mobile so this might be a formatting mess .
towards the end of the album i 'll filter in 2nd place songs and songs that were n't used in order to complete with sad sappy sucker the longest album .
keep in mind that the album should flow so just do n't vote for your fav song .
please keep in mind that the previous song should transition into the next one so not only vote for your favourite song but also for the one that fits the tracklist the best !
this is n't a post about changes that epic could make to the game this is about how we as players introduce others to the game .
i believe that there is still a lot of stigma around the starter decks and when people are explaining the game they get bogged down in cards gems and affinities .
this rarely helps new players because the more you delve into it the more complicated it becomes and the harder it is for someone to just pick up and play .
if you have someone who you want to introduce the game just jump into the game with them .
the starter decks are perfectly fine for new players and all they need to know is
spend gold to buy pips once you have enough of the right pips you can equip cards back at base .
pips are either agility for offense vitality for tanks intellect for casters .
i 've tried helping new players build a deck early on as i enjoy building decks and every time it 's turned into a long winded mess so over time i learned to keep the introduction simple .
now i just say any starter deck is good let 's get on with the match and you will work it out as we go along !

i have n't gotten enough upgrade pieces to be able to upgrade armor much yet so i am unsure of how much a piece of armor can be upgraded .
some armors i really like the look of but their defenses are unfortunately very low compared to the other later unlocked armor .
is there any way to make these armor sets more useful or any way of making a different armor set take on the appearance of another ?
any information in this regard would be greatly appreciated and i 'm very much enjoying my first monster hunter game !

im currently sitting at rank 3 and 1 star .
my highest rank ever was rank 7 in the pirate warrior days and since then i was just playing whacky decks at rank 15 .
i usually have hard times with tempo rogue against razakus and cube/control lock .
in my mulligan against those im just fishing for any kind of pirates to aggro them down .
i have no problem against the mirror aggro/murloc paladin and any kind of dragon priest or the spiteful varient .
i have 50/50 match ups against zoolock and aggro hunter .
is it possible for me to reach legend with tempo rogue or is thete just a wall of coined out lackys turn 4 and god tier razakus aoe opener at rank 3 and higher ?
if anybody has some experience and could help me id really appreciate it .
the fault was mine i was in a rush and clicked the lock account link ... can kraken not load a self-service option with multiple security questions ?
i had to reply with security info and now the waiting continues at least at step 2
edit 2 it is now 29 jan 2018 gmt 1 and i have received an email from kraken stating that the security info has been forwarded to the account specialist .
so far kraken has been providing good support despite the naysayers .
i 'll keep you posted until the issue has been dealt with .
edit 3 the issue got resolved on 30 jan 2018 .
it 's a pii with a diamond monster fusion and 384mb of ram .
something i 've wanted to know for a while was if there was an absolute medium when it comes to tolerance and marijuana.like if you 're a certain weight/age does it takes longer/shorter to start feeling the high more or less.what about the tier of weed ?
if i 've taken a break mid can get me high for a day or two.top shelf gets me high for about 2 weeks before i have to keep smoking every couple of hours just to feel anything .
it 's saying that the app has not been released but i 'm able to play it on my ps4 .
this is a light-hearted doodle i practiced it 's basically implementing ranger-esque ranged weapon combat to paladin .
it does n't match very well but i think it 's thematically appropriate for a monster hunter paladin .

i thought i had more time before we were dealing with this .
i thought i had more time to enjoy her adorable toothless smile .
i thought i had more time before she started growing up on me !
but this week she 's started the unmistakable excessive drooling being irritable and clingy which is so unlike her and 2 little swollen tooth buds on her bottom gum and she just relaxes when you rub them .
i did n't cry when she started holding her head up .
i did n't cry when she suddenly wanted to start sitting up on her own or when she started standing up in my lap .
but knowing that her adorable gummy smile is on its way out in the next few weeks ?

i 've been trying to stream to twitch with obs using my elgato hd60s and it seems that almost every time i have obs open my feed would freeze which would result in me closing obs .
when i would restart obs i either get a bluescreen or i 'd have to change the source feed for my hd60s in obs which would then cause it to bluescreen .
i 'm super frustrated right now not because i want to stream something but because this is n't the first time i 've had problems with an elgato game capture product .
i originally had an elgato hd60 almost 2 years ago that would bluescreen my previous pc when i unplugged it from the usb port .
now i 'm getting bluescreen issues with the hd60s trying to stream with obs .
i guess in a glass half full world i 'm making some kind of progress towards a working product but this is really upsetting .

be the best leader you can be and convince them through your actions that you are a strong leader .
i certainly would n't initiate a discussion about how you are young for a leader .
if they bring it up in public ask them to talk to you privately .
if that happens remind them that you were n't the one who made the decision and that your director may be able to tell them more .
but being that you are n't the only leader i 'd also remind them that the goal is to have the best leadership team not the two best leaders .
it 's very possible they are a better leader than you but your leadership style meshes with the senior better than them .
another thing you could consider saying but would need to be careful with is that sometimes the best leaders are the ones not called leaders .
rookies wo n't look to leaders for examples because they know that they will act in the way they want the section to act not the way the section really acts .
it 's the upperclassmen who are n't leaders who decide how the section actually works and as upperclassmen without a leader title they have a chance to lead by example .
i 'd be careful with that though only say it if you truly believe it .
i do together with the t114 and i 'll just drive around in the city at c .
whens the last time you saw someone effectively use rubber guard in mma ?
been looking for a supreme sticker for my drag !
subaru 's characterization did get frustrating especially during the suffering arc .
first it was definitely the right thing to do with the character .
i really did n't enjoy watching it but the fact that they were willing to try it immediately puts it leaps and bounds ahead of the vast majority of other isekais .
if you took out the arc the work would be diminished as a whole .
he thinks he 's over the hill has learned what he 's needed to learn about living his new life did his suffering time and can now sit back and reap those sweet sweet anime romance benefits .
this was done very well with julius where we see him make a snap judgement of another person off of what appears to be solely anime tropes ?
what follows this was objectively hard to watch but necessary to set up the conflict .
it 's only when we start to see where the the loop is that my problem arises .
subaru is acting like a douchebag and he 's acting like a crazy person .
basically we have about three episodes where we just have to watch him fuck up for the same reason over and over .
there is no real tension because i know for a fact that there is no way he can solve this problem till he sorts himself out emotionally .
ideally we would see maybe one episode of crazy douchebag subaru and then see him figure out what to do a bit more on the next life then a bit more on the next and all this leading to a gradual buildup of competence .
as it stands it 's just annoying to watch .
i do n't actually believe that it 's possible to maintain that kind of do or die mentality for weeks on end no matter how much dying hurts .
but i do n't like how we went total face heel turn on subaru mental state .
instead of a buildup in ability to deal '' and social competence '' we go from zero to sixty .
why could n't we do some accelaration instead of watching him fuck up over and over becuase of the same basic reason he 's a douchebag .
i am not as familiar with us cultural goodbyes .
i hate when people bring up this mmr excuse .
they want card level disparity to cause people to lose .
they may lose players to frustration but they 'll make plenty of money off people who buy shit to level up .
it 's also why they keep throwing in new cards and many of those new cards/decks are stronger than older cards .
if you already had a competitive level deck through long-term playing or buying you are no longer a customer they care about .
make it more difficult to level up your existing deck and make your deck less competitive to the new cards ?
even the newest packs are a sign of how terrible all of this is .
30 to get one of the new legendaries with some other packs .
even if you 're super lucky it 's not enough to build a competitive deck .
if you buy both you 've spent 60 on a tier-2 game if we 're generous and ca n't reasonably play competitively regardless of how skilled you are .
i honestly hope netmarble and any game using this model fail miserably .
what if there was a truly 'extra ' perk that was unlocked through use ?
a weapon could have one of the more powerful perks from d1 stuff like third eye grenadier life support rangefinder etc .
it would be an investment-type feature sort of like seeing your kill count on masterwork weapons .
speaking of which i got a mw nameless midnight pretty early on but it had range .
this week i got one with reload much better .
so i gave up my 2000 kills to start all over .
kahoot is good if you literally have nothing else to do .
yes because hitler 's plan was literally to invade eastern europe .
mein kampf was very clear on hitler 's goals for the slavic people .
he openly planned to invade their lands displace them and open them up for the use of the german people .
the west 's initial reaction to this was to let the two groups fight each other so that communism and fascism would destroy each other .
it was n't until the obvious success of the five year plans became apparent that the west realised that this would end with the soviets in control of mainland europe that lead to the allies supporting the soviets and the d-day invasions themselves were a brazen attempt to get to berlin before the soviets .
we would n't have committed to a land invasion of europe nearly as quickly had the ussr not started to push the german advance back .

pretty much any argument you can bring up for or against it could go on forever .
i say there are no filters you say i should just not look at it i say i do n't want to spend that time you say it 's not that much time and on and on again .
i am personally against tt for a variety of reasons i wish the mods would have handled the entire situation differently .
currently i have 3 pve sets using mods to focus them on their subclass and a generic pvp set .
if i 'm taking from the picture shown each raid armor piece will have 1 or 2 mod types '' with those mods each having 3 sub versions focused on a specific subclass .
so for the raid i can have 1 set that actually supports all 3 subclasses all i need to do is swap the mods ?
if i 'm right about that as part of mod 2.0 will we see a similar system for non raid mods ?
say instead of grenades recharge faster when using a solar subclass '' it just becomes grenades recharge 20 faster stacks 3 times ''
to be perfectly honest just adding that would go a long way towards easing my inventory troubles .
then i could keep armor sets because i like how they look .

how was she not fired for that stunt with the notebook ?
not only was it entirely unprofessional and very trashy she extended the waits of the customers and probably added to any degree of dissatisfaction they might have already had about the service going slowly .
all she did was compound the situation so that she could power trip and seeing as the problem got out of control because she was late she should be gone .

everyone else has taken the fairly obvious route of altering the encounter somehow so i 'll play devil 's advocate and say something else .
i think there 's also another issue at stake here .
the longer you play d d the more you 'll come to memorise different aspects just through your familiarity and experiences .
the base issue is that you 're dming a player/group who 's familiar with the mechanics of something before they fight it .
let 's ignore the issue of the player intentionally metagaming ahead of time .
eventually whether you maintain your current group or switch up your social circles and run with another group you 'll come across someone who as a player knows more about the encounter than their character does .
this is not a failure of you as a dm or them as a player .
as only one other person has mentioned there should be some discussion going on here .
an accord between the dm and the players should be reached acknowledging the character player knowledge divide and the dm 's stance on metagaming .
at the end of the day we 're all doing this to have fun and it 's to that end that y'all need to hash out what 's okay and what 's not okay .

extent of iran 's support for thes e groups is exaggerated for political purposes
play on sunni fears of iranian influence there are fears in syria that the iranians are active in both shia proselytizing and conversion of mostly poor sunnis .
though often exaggerated such fears reflect an element of the sunni community in syria that is increasingly upset by and focused on the spread of iranian influence in their country through activities ranging from mosque construction to business .
both the local egyptian and saudi missions here as well as prominent syrian sunni religious leaders are giving increasing attention to the matter and we should coordinate more closely with their governments on ways to better publicize and focus regional attention on the issue .

fixed a bug where the ap boost on bonetooth was n't working
empowered q now consumes ferocity on cast should fix a number of bugs and feel issues
closest enemy leap bonus gain 4 ferocity gain 3 ferocity and shred the target 's armor by 10/14/18 for 4 seconds .
casting q before you leap will now cause the leap to use q animation
ap rengar had already been doing well thanks to the e ratio and q lichbane synergy .
still worried that ap rango may not be different enough from ad and will be just better '' if we make it viable .
full ferocity on ult opened up some cool plays but due to the timing of the ferocity gain start of leap it was messing with rengar 's ability to combo .
if he wanted to cast something in air say bola strike he 's be forced to empower it .
hope is that by reducing the gain to 3 it will offer more reaction time for opponents to flash while at the same time opening up a lot of creative combos that will make rengar feel better as well air skill into empowered skill .
still curious if ferocity is a good direction for the r. iteration continues .
added an armor shred to the leap on closest bonus because we feel it is important that it empower him more vs. the guy he leaps on was seeing instances of him leaping to a random tank to get the ferocity and then flashing on the adc to murder them .
lethality rengar has been suffering in our tests since the removal of the crit/bonus damage so a shred seemed like a good middle ground to help him out .
the damage is n't upfront so he can be flashed but his followup damage will be much stronger due to how flat shreds/lethality synergize with themselves .
like full ferocity this may be the wrong direction will continue to explore and validate feedback is appreciated .
also noticed that people liked the old tiamat and q leap animations so we hooked up new ones with the assets we have .
particles look weird on q leap right now but if the direction is good those can be cleaned up in the future .
i only found this out because my friend is already trying to bully me into reading it https cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/234179575913906176/406257346457763851/image.png

big post suggestion plz read it all before you judge it
what if they remove it like they do but add some combat stats to the champs that go through that ultimate ?
in that way people will use it instead of avoiding it .
1 if ryze or allies teleport with that ulti get a massive amount of movement speed and while the teleportation is charged ryze gets bonus movement speed in that way ryze will become hard to hit during his channel and he will make the mind games getting the r or not way more mindy '' also giving the aoe movement speed for lets say 1 second and the burst reduced by time .
let 's say 2 seconds total ms but after the 1 second the ms is dropping rapidly
2 ryze and allies have shield based on ryze mana and ap for 1 second that will make ryze ulti utility engage
3 ryze and allies will get 50 bonus armor and magic resist based on the value of the tankiest '' champ joining the teleport that will make ryze+tank engage way cool
4 ryze and allies get bonus ap and ad based on the most ap and ad the allied champs had while joining
first of all ryze has to teleport with the allies so the effects other than tp take place
secondly for everytime ryze casts a 5 man teleport he unlocks the next level of the r that will give 1-4 bonuses see numbers above and also more range
ryze wo n't be able to scale that ability during a level up the only way to do it is with 5 man ultying
also ryze will get 2 more points in his q instead of r balancing it better during q ranks that means that maxed q will do more damage than the today 's maxed q but every q rank before that will make less damage tbh the numbers can change dramatically to balance him with his new ulti
that will make ryze rewarded for using the r also will reward his team by communicating it better and soloq ryze players will use it more and his teammates will access it more because of the value will bring now
ranks of the ulti may or may not be able to get selected by the ryze player that means either the ryze next r will be fixed/random/or able to get selected like kha evolve
i suggest radios still be mana and ap but due to the new r be tp+combat stats he has to have bigger mana costs and fewer ratios in his kit overall
maybe with that r riot will be able to make ryze w also a skill shot

claro que entre todos os filósofos atuais tal como na física há quem se arrisque a criar uma teoria dentro de uma vertente específica tipo foucault e as relações de poder mas são poucos e geralmente só os que são bem influentes fazem isto .
no geral as pessoas formadas em filosofia que nada mais são que professores e pesquisadores da disciplina de filosofia estão mais restritos ao estudo analítico e problematizante da área .
aliás é equivocado chamar alguém formado em filosofia de filósofo .
filósofo em geral são os panteões da filosofia e que contribuíram de forma ímpar pra área kant aristóteles platão foucault descartes etc .

i messaged them through their site and email multiple times but never got anything .
this should be the right one i live in pennsylvania .
i think i asked you questions about that one because i was like wtf when 2 questions in the first 5 required extreme outside knowledge .
way deeper content necessary than the easy punnett squares people were complaining about on the june act .
more specifically what 's your estimate frag/day or day per fragment ?
did it change for you guys from the initial open world to all the later added contents ?
and ratio for s bronya vs s sakura frag drops from the jar ?
i was in the mind-frame that left-wingers/feminists were out to further marginalize men and to polarize a system already unfair to men .
what kind of propaganda did he have to consume to go back to believing it isn't unfair for men ?
i 'll just copy-paste this post i saw from someone else
when men ask for help from domestic violence hotlines and shelters almost 2/3 outright state they only help women https nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/3977-researcher-what-hap-3977 .
sixteen percent of men said the people at the hotline dismissed or made fun of them . ''
when the huffington post says something is wrong with how male victims of domestic violence are treated http www.huffingtonpost.com/bari-zell-weinberger-esq/its-time-to-acknowledge-m_b_8292976.html you know something is wrong .
'' but men are only the perpetrators of domestic violence never the victims ! ''
if you only watch the nightly news that 's the only story you know .
men ca n't be the victim '' of relationship abuse right ?
turns out in 2010 according the the cdc men were the majority of domestic abuse victims http www.saveservices.org/2012/02/cdc-study-more-men-than-women-victims-of-partner-abuse .
you 'd think more people would know about male victimization would n't you ?
'' why do n't they just find a men 's shelter ?
they would but there 's literally only one http www.arkansasonline.com/news/2016/feb/11/batesville-nonprofit-opens-domestic-violence-shelt ? f=threerivers and it 's in arkansas .
this despite the fact that according the national network to end domestic violence nnedv there are over 1,700 domestic violence shelters http nnedv.org/downloads/census/dvcounts2016/whole 20census 20report 20 smaller .pdf in the us .
never mind the fact that that report focuses almost exclusively on women and children .
i think it 's fairly well known that women receive shorter sentences for the same crimes but by how much ?
turns out men receive about 63 more time in prison https www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx than women for the same crime .
that gender gap is six times larger than the racial disparity between blacks and whites .
maybe we can talk about how men represent over 70 of suicide victims https afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics ?
but you probably wo n't hear about that on the news .
turns out men make up the majority in the us https www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2016-ahar-part-1.pdf and in the uk it 's even worse 71 of homeless are men http www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11787304/homelessness-is-a-gendered-issue-and-it-mostly-impacts-men.html
women only earn 78 cents for every dollar a man makes right ?
actually that statistic did not control for any variables whatsoever https fee.org/articles/truth-and-myth-on-the-gender-pay-gap .
the researchers who came up with that did not account for hours spent working men work more choice of career men choose higher paying careers length of career men work longer or any other variables than can and should affect how much someone earns .
that 78 figure is very deliberately misleading and in fact among young professionals women make about 8 more than men for the same jobs http content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,2015274,00.html .
in some cities that disparity goes up to 20 .
we can go further a lot further if you 'd like .
some examples men represent 97 of war deaths 93 of workplace fatalities win child custody in less than a quarter of cases huge disparities in child support alimony unfair treatment in divorce and above all when you try to claim men can be victims people will literally attack you http www.titleixforall.com/protesters-threaten-violence-and-death-against-international-mens-issues-conference-in-detroit-at-doubletree-hilton .
or we could touch on false rape accusations abuse sexual assault or child abuse allegations against men .
edit the more i read into this the more trouble i have believing that this guy was actually an mra .
you ca n't just unlearn '' about systematic imbalances and inequality .
you 'd have to deliberately say all these facts that i 've learned are wrong it 's not possible for men to be victimized . ''
here 's my guess this guy if it 's even a guy just made this story up because he knew r/politics would lap up the story of a reformed '' red pill/mra two almost completely unrelated communities .
the mothers rights are more important than the fetus 's rights .

for some reason you and people like yourself seem to hold random users on reddit to a higher standard than you do actual high up employees in the corporation who is fucking up .
but the issue is that you still have to decide how you want to handle nan from what you are saying i 'm assuming you 'd want nan to be when inspected .
which in some contexts is fine but it does make and partial which is unfortunate but in many others it is not practical as we want to actually catch nan or ignore it which you should not do with .
i am just definitely not ok with nan breaking various invariants through unlawful instances .
crashing things or making them nothing is much more ok but invariants are crucial for reasoning about behavior .

i remember briefly watching the one with nicole struggling to get on the bed and generally shrieking and being a colossal bitch to her husband and parents 'you bunch of bastards ' and all and getting out of breath from just standing .

getting attached to ketamine everytime you do lsd seems like a bad idea .
lsd is super easy to get and has a total tolerance reset in a few weeks .

even more expensive when you need to rail half gram lines to feel anything because you blew your tolerance by using it with every lsd trip

she suggests restricting the of men born to 10 .

very crazy and ideas are not thought through at all .
it is just expressions of man hating from what i can see at a glance .
there are complex social and contextual rules about when and where the n word is acceptable and who can use it .
the use vs mention '' distinction is also a little counterintuitive for a lot of people .
it 's difficult to apply these social rules fairly and evenly in a school setting where things ares usually more legalistic '' and clear cut .
i think a suspension is maybe too much but the school can only get any kind of fairness by just making slurs unacceptable across the board and enforcing the rule flatly .

ah and the predictable behavior ensues when they discover what was actually going on in the photo
the fucked up part about it is that i had zero problem thinking this is a real person with that thought process .
there are an alarming amount of people who actually do think that way and it 's completely pathetic .
but assuming the photo shows what you believe vs. what it actually demonstrates is somehow not pathetic ?
tbh it 's expected with how much white hatred there is .
white people from birth are taught to hate their skin color it 's taught in schools enforced by law aa anyone ? .
if they dare defend themselves when attacked by a black person has to be black other minorities do n't get the same privileges they 're attacked even more for not bowing down and doing what the aggressor wants .
yeah good thing the civil rights movement stopped blacks from making white people bow down and then taking all the good jobs like over 90 of the ceo positions in america .

imagine being able to pick a british commentary if your from england or a young tony-romoish announcing of the game or just opting for a tradition joe buck style .
if listening to tony romo this year taught me anything it 's that the current announcers are boring as fuck that just spout out meaningless statistics .
never realized how much good commentary can make or break a game .
right now all you can do for an alternative is try to sink up your local radio announcing of the game with the actual game muted .
but that 's less than optimal for obvious reasons .

what do you have to do to trigger episode 3 to start ?
to your first point i argued that the electoral college can not prevent a dangerously unqualified leader from taking office because we have trump a candidate with no qualifications whatsoever and who is in fact mentally unstable .
your counter-argument to this was that just the fact that he won makes him qualified which completely contradicts your entire point about the protection the electoral college is supposed to provide .
the system worked because the winner it picked was qualified '' but the winner was qualified because the system picked them . ''
with this circular argument any system of picking a president could be rationalized as being a decent system .
picking a name out of a hat works because it picks a qualified candidate '' and whoever 's name we picked out of a hat must be qualified because it was their name that we picked out of a hat ! ''

mkhitaryan played in brazil in his youth for instance and that 's where he learnt portuguese .
now if you can already speak that then learning romantic languages should be much easier like spanish and italian as some of the phrases and words sound very similar .
the grammatics and pronunciation are different of course but that comes with time .
he has never played in either of those countries but strikes me as an intelligent person he 's got a degree in economics etc so it does n't surprise me one bit that he 's taken his time to learn all that stuff .
i do n't know about armenian language but i 'm pretty sure it shares some similarities with russian which is not too far off from ukrainian where he played for like 4-5 years .
living abroad as a child has given mkhitaryan a talent for learning languages .
as well as his mother tongue armenian he speaks french russian english and portuguese .
english is the one he 'd like to improve most however as he revealed to panorama.am .

most of the time especially in the low countries if people wanted to be better protected from the wealthy nobles especially they would go and live in or around cities .

anyway do you actually see the difference right to protest does n't mean you can protest anywhere you want .
it also does n't protect you from counter-protests which i 'd imagine in the case of anti-abortion may become large than the protest .
the easiest way i beat wp varyas is by using wp bf with atlas pauldron .

the issue is probably that readbytes returns everything up to and including the delimiter so line will include the newline and comparison fails as your string does n't .

so in tlj we saw snoke spoiler cut in half by kylo ren spoiler ends but i do n't actually think that snoke is actually dead in that scene .
i believed that snoke is actually some sort of force spirit that do n't really need physical body to remain alive and by the end of the movie we saw a slave boy using the force uncannily .
i thought that the boy is actually possessed by snoke as he mysteriously figured out how to use the force most importantly to move things with the force with literally no knowledge about the force .
this fact points out that he should have a very strong connection with the force just like the skywalker and some other force sensitives in the galaxy .
snoke himself also known as a very strong force user as he has a vast connection and knowledge with the force .
he has also lived sround since the day of the galactic republic and also witnessed the rise and the fall of the empire .
this means that he could 've been trained a lot of dark side power .
it 's also possible that he has found a new force ability to revive a new physical body .
so basically snoke is n't dead he revived and return as a slave boy in canto bight .

i 've been hearing too many inconsistencies regarding the fine for tinted windows in nyc .
it previously was a 50 vehicle equipment violation now i hear it 's a fine given per window .
the dmv does not state the fine and their video does n't either .
i saw a newscast where they were saying 287 per window .
i 've also heard of other dollar amounts per window and would like to know the exact amount .

it 's seems that may is n't particularly popular among the tories in this sub especially with regards to encryption and the nhs .
that said i find it hard to know what people who are card-carrying tories actually would like to be done if their ideal candidate appeared from backbench obscurity to take over after may .
as person who started adventure with this remarkable series yet in the nineties i have spent much time playing and knowing all the details of lore behind the scenes etc .
i am always excited when there is even a glympse of possible new game in the future i even sat recently and thought on ideas of possible reboot .
this however will be presented later because today i have 2 questions regarding some behind the scenes material from defiance '' that i was hopind to ask for a long time and finally i think i have found a place to share them .
there is a trailer for defiance '' with lots of content still not polished or altered in the final game we have kain in voradors mansion different health icons etc but what puzzled me the most was creature shown in here
it looks like greater shade that appears later in the game but this one seems bigger than the one in retail version .
is it really bigger or it 's only illusion ?
when kain walks through vampire citadel he sees a mural depicting human revolt that was led by moebius .
when we examin the mural we see that there also is mortanius and a mysterious woman .
for future posts i will be bringing the reconstruction of original soul reaver 2 defiance and dark prophecy content and also some ideas on rebooting .
just iron out these building kinks and i 'm fucking set .
well right now they are under pakistan 's protection .
they along with uae and saudi arabia were the only three countries to recognize the afghan taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan .
everyone knows pakistan is arming and funding the afghan taliban but the us cant do squat because all its supply routes flow through pakistan not like they can ask iran !

so i get that my friends and i all have to watch the cut scene at the beginning and cut scene for the monster but when i return to the home base it seems to automatically abandon the quest and we have to pick it up all over again from the handler thus negating watching the cut scene .
how do i return to base to post the quest for my friends to join without abandoning it ?

i 've read a fair bit on fo4edit and downloaded it but i 'm still lost regarding on what should i edit if say i want the heavy gun perk to increase my damage to 3x instead of 2 and i 've also downloaded a few weapon mods that sadly are a bit weak so knowing which property to edit would be immensely helpful .

we are unlikely to win the league and the fa currently while important if we get further in the champions league .
i still think we have n't seen united in full gear yet this season maybe when we start to come up against some.of the biggert teams i just think that extra space they will give us could help us on up .
i dunno i ca n't think of many teams that want to play us over two legs .

i was recently in iran and really enjoyed my stay .
now i would like to hear how you see iran developing for non-native visitors in the near future .
i only met friendly and honest people but with tougher times ahead i wonder if this will change ...
to give some positive examples i never had to doubt if i 'm given back enough money in transactions .
my reading of persian numbering is slow in addition to dealing with a foreign currency but i never got cheated afaik .
though i 'm not able to enage in any serious taroof i could even show a handful notes and the people cashing in would pick the correct ones counting them to me .
likewise i never felt that i had to worry about my belonings or luggage .
it would have been trivial to pickpocket me in the overcrowded tehran metro but even there i heard the pickpocketers prefer locals to keep up iranian reputation abroad .
i have travelled quite a lot and i can honestly say that iranians are the friendliest people i have ever dealth with abroad even in the bazaars nobody tries to forcibly sell you stuff .
do you think i 'm naive or that i got lucky ?
i really hope to return to iran in the near future and i 'm concerned for the development of the country .
only thing missing from my wishlist is banshee sonority which i 'll have to wait until february for

since i 've bought sfv ae my mains have been r.mika necalli rashid ed and two of them i need some assistance .
so my problem i need help on is what are the best ways to get in your opponent without jumping with those two ?
i know this is the usual beginners trap to get caught on and it 's the truth with necalli and mika because they need to get close to the opponent and what most people that i go against are projectile characters so i have to jump over them and they 'll anti-air me to oblivion or i 'll block them and get in little by little but get countered with a throw or a combo .
so yeah if i could get some veteran wisdom on this encounter that would be awesome oh !
and also additional question for those two characters what are some good combo starters on the ground with them ?

edit my code was in an email after all ...
it 's not because of religious or moral reasons i find it to be a natural good thing .
i watch a lot of porn too i touch it and rub it but i never had the courage to jerk it .
i was driving home from a theater rehearsal and realized it was the right time and right neighborhood to hit a late night meeting i know of .
after making it a year and two months relapsing pulling myself out of it a few weeks later and going sober again for what feels like about a month-ish i thought yeah i 'm due to check in with the community . ''
when the meeting started i checked sd and discovered i was at exactly 30 days .
i 've always had the feeling that synchronous moments like these tell me i 'm on the correct path and this happening is one of those moments .
proud and grateful to be on the wagon with you all tonight and with my local fellows .
i recently had a ticket open about potentially getting my old account back but because i could n't remember the email i used back in 2011 i was told there was nothing that could be done and they closed the ticket .
after doing a lot of searching i found my old paypal account and i found many nc purchases that i made for that account .
considering this is new information that i did n't have before do you think if i submitted another ticket with the paypal information would i have a chance at getting my account back ?
i know it 's not an email but it 's definitely proof i spent money and can show the receipts .
i 've put a lot of work into my newer account but i have pets that i love and i just want to see what 's left there .
it got compromised and i know some nc items were stolen .
so basically i have a dell with win 8.1 i 'm gon na temporarily beef up until i finish my build .
let 's say i have a ssd and win 10 retail .
can i unplug the hard drive with 8 and install the ssd and 10 and use the pc with that a while .
then when done just unplug the win10 drive and put the win 8 back in and have it work like before ?
or will the win8 key in bios get overwritten once i use win10 .
the sad and 10 are for new build but i could use it on old for now
so i 've just bought myself the venom arcade stick .
while being fairly solid i understand that the stick and buttons are not up to par as they are crappy chinese knock offs .
through scanning the internet for a suitable place to buy myself a sanwa jlf i 've found a website to stock what they call a sanwa jlf series joystick – replica ''
so just wondering will there be any noticeable difference between a legit '' sanwa and a replica '' sanwa joystick ?
edit i ended up purchasing the fake one for 2 reasons
we dont get much choice in australia and shipping for the legit jlf is gon na cost me the stick twice over .
in aus this website is one of the most reputable sellers they actually sell the legitimate jlw and genuine sanwa buttons so whats interesting is that they decided to stock the replica jlf .
these are not original sanwa joysticks however they are an extremely good quality replica and offer all the functionality the jlf is renowned for .
they are of surprisingly good quality if they were rubbish we would n't sell them !
so i guess we 'll see how it goes and ill let people know if they 're the pieces of junk most expect them to be or if they are surprisingly good .

i am now officially even more in love with this series !
with this and everything before it my enjoyment of this series has only gone up as i read .
for the first time in a long while i have found a series that i could not stop reading where in some books i frequently take long stretches of breaks or even skip chapters gasp because of boring parts in mobtf every page is dripping in lore even if it 's just characters musing to themselves or travelling alone that i even take the time to reread entire pages to make sure i did n't miss anything .
the exercise is sometimes like collecting pieces of a puzzle .
the world feels lived-in and alive not to mention the characters themselves are often filled with personality and can sometimes be boisterously hilarious my dear kruppe !
this is the second post where i am just gushing about these books and for that i apologize !
i am sad that i can not find the rest of the books in the series anywhere around me and the shipping fees are astronomical !
so i have tried many ways to write this code i have a coin and when you touch the coin it gives you points as well as regenerate after a period of time .
my problem is when i put multiple coins in a row some coins fail to give points .
i have it so that when the coin is touched the model is removed and then after a period of time it will then create joints and respawn .
if i walk slowly every coin will give points but if i run through them it does n't give points .
is there a similar site that lets you download any player 's replays ?
was watching a vape review on the transformer postless rda the other night and i forgot the name of the reviewer but the way he wicked the rda was too cool to not try out .
you might think this does n't work all too well but we all know more surface area more vapor !
assuming this for a dual coil setup so this is what you do
chuck the coils in and when you do be sure as to how long you want your leads because cotton will be needing to go under said coils .
yeah so the coils are in glowing from the inside out now take a wick tail the same size like you would put through a coil but instead of through the coil thread it under both of the coils forming a sort of pillow for your coils to sit on .
in other words a bed of cotton on the bottom of your juicewell .
cut the wicks a reasonable amount not too much not too little cut em at the edge of the juicewell for a good length starting out then rewick your coils as you usually do .
when threading cotton through make sure the cotton is only bieng threaded underneath the coils and only between the legs of the leads
i can only think of positive things this wicking method would give you .
i 'm using the vandy vape mesh rda with coils installed so not a deep juicewell by any means .
and i 'm assuming that 's the sort of style most postless rda 's have excluding raised deck postless rda 's if yknow what i mean but yeah with such a low/small juice well that extra cotton on the bottom does a pretty good job of retrieving juice that wants to just fuck off out of the atty .
it 'll be able to hold more juice via cotton not just a juicewell and wick tails so it fights leaking pretty damn flawlessly
here 's da vid lem me know what u think about this

makes up a little bit for the 100 in bitcoin i lost due to the wallet i used being a scam .
i used to have tanks but shut them all down a while ago and sold off pretty much all of my stuff .
it was a combination of a lot of things that led to me to have what was essentially an adult sized tantrum and get rid of everything .
i had moved apartments started a new job was renovating my place on top of just not feeling the best mentally and then had almost all of my fish die in the span of a few months and i just could n't take it anymore .
for a while i could n't even look at fish stuff on the internet because i just felt like crap about the whole thing .
well now my life has calmed down and i find that i am visiting fish forums watching youtube videos etc .
and i really want to get a tank again .
i 've been thinking of just having a rack with two tanks about 50-60gals each .
enough to have a decent variety of fish but not too much that it will drive me insane with maintenance .
i love having tanks but i know that it can also be very hard work .
i suppose i just need some convincing and for someone to tell me that it 's okay to spend the money and put in the work for something that i really enjoy .
i truly believe that it 's important to have a hobby and i do n't really have any other interests .
its impossible to climb mmr when your team picks are very bad no teamfights or sometimes no carries even .
and always enemy team picks good heroes and play as team very well .

my periods have been all over the place for the longest time .
i 've also noticed excess hair growth around my stomach area .
ever since i 've been having these issues i 've also been putting on more weight as the time goes on despite my healthy diet and routine exercise .
my doctor thought it was pcos due to follicles on my overies however my blood tests came back normal .
to be fair you do need a high iq to understand doki doki literature club .
the game presents so many new interpretations on the physics of the natural and quantum world that unless you have a master 's degree in quantum physics and mechanics the game would just look like it was about big tittie anime babes .
i 'm here to tell all of you ignorant peasants that it 's not yuri has giant tits for a reason and that reason lies within einstein 's theory of relativity or e=mc^2 to you low-iq denizens .
you see yuri is actually a cosmic sea turtle masquerading as a student in order to seek better understanding of the world she has created from you the player .
therefore in order to hide her giant sea turtle fins she rolled them up into giant anime titties .
also yes i do have a tattoo of the love of my life monika .
but only ladies of the highest quotient can lay their ocular nerves on that tattoo .
in conclusion doki doki literature club is more than an anime dating game it 's a methodical and calculated insight into the specifics of the universe around us and the all knowing cosmic sea turtle that created that universe .
here it is in all it 's ... glory ... cough cough .
i know bungie has their focus on a lot of other d2 shit storms at the moment .
but nightstalker 's are in such a bad place .
not to mention the problem with cool-downs in crucible .
i honestly do n't understand why bungie even added the subclass in the first place especially if they were going to completely neuter it .
do n't even get me started in the two skill trees they force us to chose from .
the only reason i was able to even get a triple was because of the team shot .
for those who do n't remember quiver has always been hard to aim .
but in d1 if you got the aim down you were at least rewarded a one shot kill when you hit your target expect for guardians with really high strength .
why the fuck did bungie have to nerf into oblivion ?
i really feel bad for all d2 guardians who have never got to experience the nightstalker at it 's best .
for those of you who never played nightstalker in d1 compare the previous video with this one https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=_l8-unkjstq and you 'll see what i 'm talking about .

i 'm relatively new to warframe 22 hours at the time of this post and i 'm looking for a pretty active clan to be a part of .
i 've had a good amount of experience with catching onto the way games like this go but i know i still have a lot to learn and was hope to get help in that regard but i also want to be in a clan that can get serious in the endgame cause eventually that 's where i want to be .
i 'd also like to help contribute to a dojo .
i do n't know much about them but it sounds like a pretty cool thing to do .
i 'm fairly laid back and not much of a troublemaker but i know how to have a good time .

i 've actually found good foreign shows from these suggestions but i 've been on a stand-up comedy binge lately and i think i 've seen all the good ones in english .
now every time i open netflix i get suggested a new spanish speaking comedian .
which would make sense to an algorithm but stand-up does n't translate well .
it 's just kind of annoying that they skip the not so great comedians to show me the good foreign ones .
just wondering if there is a work around or something .
i do n't wan na go to the hospital it was worse when i went .
i know however that in gatineau and montreal there are places called centre de crise '' where you can stay for a couple of days and still keep your phone but there are social workers there and the environment is safe .
everything was going fine for the first few weeks but after pooling my coin and a few friends together in the same wallet to improve our staking i now just never stake .
i was staking every other day on average with the occasional two stakes in one day '' and keeping the wallet open about 12 hours per day .
ever since i received the last person 's deposit of cursed coins i have not staked at all in 6 days .
our total holdings should stake every other day with the tenth time staking twice in one day i averaged out the math of 1 annual earnings .
i do see that i am staking according to the icon and i 've seen the staking time drop down to 3 seconds ... then ... .nothing ... .jumps back to 1 hour .
i have and have had the latest wallet version .
i wish i lived in europe it sucks to be here if youre ass at sports

okay so i remember seeing a movie when i was very young probably 6-10 years ago and i have done searches in the past but unfortunately i do n't know any of the actor names and nothing correct comes up with a search of the plot .
from what i can remember in the film the 2 main characters are sisters .
the most memorable scene for me was when it showed the sisters as children in which they heard a cry/scream calling for help from a cave .
they hesitantly went in and as soon as they saw the person crying that person broke out into a wicked laugh talking about how evil would get them .
as the sisters hold hands one of them the older one if i remember correctly was reassuring the other do n't worry it cant get us if we keep holding hands .
younger sibling for a short time but with the evil creature worrying her she let go of her sisters hand .
ever since that experience the younger sister had evil inside her and if i am remembering right she grew up to be an oppressive ruler or queen idk and after many years sisters see each other again for the first time and the nice+older one tries to convince the evil one to stop acting this way .
hoping someone out there remembers this movie😭 thanks in advance ❤️
edit that title is misspelled i meant to say how do i recover captured pilots in x-wing ?
i 've been playing tie fighter for a bit and after beating mission iv i decided to give x-wing a try .
i found it to be much more unforgiving that tie fighter as i had no idea that the 4th wave of imperial corielian corvettes would fire and i had my shields and lasers off for max speed in level 2 .
my ship exploded and i was captured by an imperial shuttle .
now my pilot ca n't be accessed says that pilot is captured !
and i have no idea how to get him back and i do not want to ever play that first mission again as it 's just firing down ships that do n't fight back for ten minutes .
i 've been dealing with anxiety for about six years now and more often than not it gets the best of me .
i sometimes avoid social situations finding a job and most importantly my family .
in all honesty i find myself to be absolutely terrified as to where my mind will go while under such circumstances .
even still i lose train of thought on a regular basis and find myself thinking towards negativity .
whenever i discuss these circumstances with anyone they offer me one of two responses
after a while i found i wanted anything but that feedback .
part of this has to do with my will to handle anxiety on my own terms which i think a lot of us have .
but the other part has to do my true dreams in life .
to not be guided by anxiety and to take on my passion for writing at full force .
it came to me one day that anxiety is nothing more than an overabundance of energy translated into thoughts .
when this spectacle hit i began contemplating how to manipulate such energy to my advantage .
i do n't know what came over me but i figured there had to be a way .
i researched this heavily in the past month and wrote a blog on the matter here
it turns out with the practice of positive habits negative emotions caused by anxiety can be transformed .
over time this overabundant energy will have to take a new direction .

just a friendly reminder if you have electrical issues start at the absolute basics ... check your battery connections before you assume the worst .
some backstory i just bought an 88 k5 blazer a few weeks ago that admittedly needs some work done .
well last night i go to the store and come out and it wo n't start .
the starter engaged for a fraction of a second and then everything died .
well i grab my power probe out and check all my fuses .
i probe every positive wire on the damn thing using mitchell shop key pro/snap on for wiring diagrams .
huh i 've got good power good grounds everything seems to be in order .
i check my battery and the damn side post had worked itself loose .
learn from my mistake and start at the source and work your way out from there .
i am looking for a course that will be open on the weekend of the 27th .
it is going to be in the 50s this weekend so i want to play haha .
while i was playing breath of the wild on cemu i got to two shrines in the game that required me to remember a sequence of ball placements .
i went to go write it down and since i had another monitor for my pc i just opened a sticky note window and wrote down the sequence i needed to remember i have a regular monitor and a big tv connected to my pc that i dont keep right next to each other .
i solved the shrine and continued to play normally for about 30-40 minutes longer .
eventually i turned to my other monitor to do some internet browsing or chatting and i noticed that i had like 10-20 blank sticky notes open .
i was really confused but i started deleting them one by one .
as i was doing that i was also moving link around in botw .
i then noticed that both cemu and sticky notes were accepting inputs from my xbox one controller no xpadder or anything .
apparently i not only opened a bunch of new notes with the controller but deleted the sticky notes i had made as well .
after some googling i came to the conclusion that my notes were lost forever to the void .
i did n't have anything terribly important but it 's a huge pain that i lost those notes .
i just wanted to share with you guys on the off chance some of you may find yourselves in my position .
tl dr i accidentally left sticky notes the active window because cemu does n't have to be the active window to take inputs from a controller .
sticky notes took inputs from the controller while my eyes were away and closed everything .
i 'm having more fun watching it but ca n't grasp why .
a very impactful name in the cryptocurrency community current united nations block chain advisor new position as of this year was giving a lot of interviews this past week at davos with a make america great again hat on .
knowing him personally it makes me wonder if the community has any idea of background regarding the faces that are representing us .
to clarify when i went to high school with him he wore militarized gear with nazi salutes often writing lengthy threatening posts under the pics of him saluting about harming others in one of america 's most jewish towns .
he thinks he 's in the illuminati not confirmed if he actually is lol .
during this time he found bitcoin and was the first in our state to successfully mine with his super computer he built called the hive it 's quite impressive i 'll give him that .
he then threatened the entire police force in our town and they had to arrest him for the threats when he payed his way out he put threats on certain officers families after heated facebook arguments remember the hat .
our high school added extra security during this time .
he got out of all that due to his dad being highly ranked at the un how he got the current advisor job then went into exile into thailand .
during this time he got married and had kids with a fellow classmate .
few years later he snaps and pulls out an ar on random people in thailand once again dad bails him out and the press protects him after the initial story airs .
he then beats his wife and maid after seeking exile in thailand .
his wife gets out of thailand and he 's put into thai jail until you guessed it dad makes a few calls .
most recently he fucked over a mutual buddy that gave him shelter after he was allowed back into america under trump .
he has strings with people at trump 's whitehouse it seems ... not confirmed .
he felt he could fuck my buddy over because he '' holds power that people value and want more of '' hence why we are posting this .
once the proper discussion is brought forth i 'd be glad to share proof of everything .
more standards need to be set forth or people like this will represent us with embarrassment .
this post is partially made to trash him because he is a pos but it is made to bring to light some issues in the community .
i hope a proper discussion comes of this about qualifications of representation .
my friend vinnie decided he could n't get clean by himself .
i ca n't be prouder of him for admitting he had a problem and asking for my help .
does anyone know how long the blackout period at carrier clinic in nj is for ?
god i 'm just so fucking proud of him .
i know it will be a struggle every day for the rest of his life but if i can be a sober friend to vinnie i will feel good .
so ever since i heard about ready or not as a game on r/gaming the very day the trailer was release i was hyped so much for what is essentially the swat 5 game we never got .
now as development goes on i 'm sure you devs have a lot to consider on how the game functions mechanics the mechanics of tools and gadgets and countless other possibility one must account for when making a game of such depth as being part of a swat team .
one thing that came to mind very recently was when i was playing rainbow six siege now i know for sure that ron will not be much like r6 s and i 'm very grateful that this game is gear towards swat 4 a game i picked up after hearing about it on youtube last year and enjoyed all the minutes and hours i put into the perfect raid on buildings but an issue i realize is with the tactic everyone wants to do and everyone so dearly hates ... spawnpeeking .
this is mainly a question for the devs but i 'd also like to see how everyone on here should discuss how it should be handled .
i know very well that with a tactical game like this watching the windows and doors of your approach is very vital as not only watching all openings in a building may give you hints as to enemy locations hostages etc .
may be it 's always frustrating to be immediately shot in the face before you could even stack up on a door on the outside of a building and the wait the comes with it having to watch your teammates win the round with 1 member in their breach .
so i ask the devs what are your plans or even if you had thought about this issue as of the time and progress of your development of ron about the issue .
whether it be that nothing will be done editing map designs to lessen the issue or something as far as invulnerability to players at the start of a round/match .
i 'd like to hear what the devs have so say on this and also i want to know what the community here thinks about spawnpeeking in ron 's multiplayer .
while i do n't see it as much as an issue in a game where the detail on how you clear buildings is vital to winning or losing it is undoubtedly annoying to sit out a full round after being shot before entering your target .
edit did n't realize until now that the text is too long and it needs a tl dr so ... .
tl dr spawnpeeking is a problem in games like rainbow six siege so will there be steps taken to prevent or discourage this ?
or will we have to remain vigilant upon approaching the objective from the outside ?
so it 's been a couple of months since i hit level 5 and had a bad trip due to doing the whole nine yards of what not to do and ended up in the hospital .
since then i 've not been wanting to touch the stuff .
but why is there a temptation to go back to that world that mortified me ?
i wish will smith was a real life bud fairy and whenever i was dankrupt he would appear in the middle of the night dressed as his character from independence day but instead of dragging it an alien he 's dragging a giant bag of girl scout cookies .
he still turns and kicks it and yells 'what is that smell ? ! '
before disappearing in a cloud of the dankest smoke .
came here to say i clotheslined myself with a smith machine bar last week .
may can be either very warm or a moderate 20°c here .
am right i think it 's more in jest .
you left your headphones off of this shot even though your pens were in the headphones photo .
does anyone know if you can stream the game from the cbs website or if you have to download a trial like fubo ?
i am not in an area that picks up a good satellite signal .
indeed i just want to know more about the things that happened thus far

why do n't you take a look at the flairs of everyone arguing against you .
patriots fans are the only ones who think it was a super dirty hit .
everyone else agrees that it was an unfortunate circumstance that led to a hit that could have been placed dirty .
i agree with the penalty i agree with the fine but i also stand by the fact that church was going for a big hit and this is what happens sometimes .
that comment had nothing to do with you and everything to do with him .
i 'm sure your makeup skills are just fine .
he 's compensating for a feeling of inferiority or simply not being raised properly .

and if the raven is william why does he tell chloe to not trust the raven ?
the fire is set up as some major event roughly equivalent to the storm in lis .
and yet it just ... goes out like halfway in episode 3 with no explanation and it 's never spoken of again .
the raven was clearly meant to symbolize either rachel or sera the raven is to be respected never trusted '' ... but that petered out entirely as well .
and the doe was rachel in lis ... it 's been confirmed by dontnod .

thats why im depressed ive already squandared my puberty and high school and college potential to live as a girl and experience those things now i feel lost and i have no real friends that really understand .
i also have to deal with the shame of being trans and of being a woman .
im literally afraid to let go of trying to be a man but even if i could i need to put myself in a constantly affirming environment to break all the habits of being a male and with my avoidant personality disorder i feel too dependent and i immediately run from that .
plus i have to deal with the regular issues of life and its all too much to bear no license no job dropped out college loans leeching off parents etc .
im too much of a coward suicides too scary but i just want to not exist .
i dont want to be the me that i am .
ive never been comfortable with this body and i never will be that 's how i feel 99 of the time and how i have felt my entire life .
apart from dysphoria ive got a huge ribcage short neck stout torso lanky arms a bulbous troll like nose with a ridge in it and large feet and thin hips of course .
i dont know how to be comfortable with this body and ive tried to be .
they definitely helped but from the side im still not passing thanks to male bone structure .
i want voice surgery because when i sigh/cough/sneeze/relax i sound male .
i agree that appearances are n't the main focus but its hard not to feel that way .
especially when i know that what people like me for are the parts i hate about myself .
the crazy thing is that since my doctor cut my hormones off due to other mental health concerns i actually feel more like myself now that im on a half dose using up the rest of my diy of spironolactone i feel more alive and like myself .
im afraid that i need male levels of testosterone to feel normal .
im hoping its just the spironolactone and god how i hate that drug .
a bad riser would give it voltage or shorting issues possibly bad ram .
if this were your first bad psu i 'd say go ahead and rma it but the odds of you getting 2 bad psu 's is so unlikely

i was expecting a more intricate way of absorbing information with this sub considering i have n't posted here before my plan is to become a regular now .
not to say that your suggestion is n't helpful though i appreciate it thanks !
her bat is strangely stronger if she imitates the scout 's voice and shouts bonk '' every time she hits someone .
tbh if they 're treating you like shit and it 's based on her side only then yes i would cut ties .
it 's better to leave all that behind and have no form of contact or updates with your ex because this fuels her .
also hanging around people she also does makes it easier for her to keep tabs on you .

i definitely agree but i 've learned that there are some people that talking just does n't work they 're stubborn like a mule and it 's their way or the highway .
in these cases i either just let go and avoid interacting with the person or double down and become even worse than them to make them taste their own poison .

i challenge someone to write a short plot summary of that movie .
can you imagine the shitshow of side characters and stories they would have to build out around that story ?
that story belongs in a comic book or mayyyybe a novella .
i mean jesus christ i just disagree strongly with that so i 'm sorry if i 'm rude .
and what do you mean big bucks ? like you would finance the movie ?
i 'm about to go out and get me a couple of mags or something .
looking at the ideas on the right they are less than to be desired .
they are overall less logical and fact based and they do n't usually work and when they do work in a limited capacity .
social justice comes from the ideas that people are more or less all the same in the end .
it 's also known that no one person is an island to themselves so we are all dependent and affected by those around us .
we know this through various academic disciplines such as the hard sciences and the social sciences .

i had a really good experience recently on ps4 as i 've said several times in other threads recently i just started playing this christmas .
i played the crap out of this game huge elder scrolls fan huge mmo fan and holidays .
so i 'm already 50 and was learning new dungeons and basically everything about the game much later than i should 've perhaps since i just leveled up before learning anything about the game classes stats roles etc .
my random queue brought me into a ii '' dungeon for the first time which i did n't know was possible or that they existed .
so when i kept dying to mechanics and or boss attacks i was getting really confused as i 'd cleared the dungeon before and did n't see any issue or remember getting oneshot .
throughout the dungeon i think i died at least 5 times per boss fight and my feed was always one or two abilities max .
i was very vocal in chat keyboard plugged in .
the tank basically took me under his wing and explained the entire dungeon patiently and without accusation over voice the entire time .
he taught me the importance of stat food and how my low health of 12,000 at level 50 was a large part of why i was dying alot .
pointed out how my gear was out-leveled by 20-30 cp at this point .
after the dungeon he stuck around and continued to explain different mechanics and nuances of the game he even crafted me 5 set of hunding and 4 set of night mother upgraded to epic weapons included free of charge .
he just towed me around to the crafting stations while explaining the game and answering questions the entire time then handed me the gear along with 200 cp 100-140 stamina health food and said this should tide you over to 160 best of luck . ''
so sure there 's toxicity and i 've found my share of people who are just way too upset about an online game but there 's also people who are just so far above and beyond what is generous and kind like this guy .
all i know is his character 's name was healer '' w special characters .
not to derail your thread just though i 'd share the overwhelmingly positive experience i had very early into my eso life .
much higher dps and flight speed in exchange for some energy .
with a primed flow and a streamline it actually isnt that bad .

i wish i could agree ... or disagree with you but i do n't think i watched more than 3 minutes of the fb stream in total throughout the entire event .
maybe if esl made a better choice regarding the platform they streamed on i would have been able to see it .
i 'm sure mercedes is very happy with the outcome of this choice .
this is my first beta so when the devs every few months completely revamped everything i thought oh this normal .
it felt like they were some investment broker taking my money assuring me they know what they are doing despite the slow decline and seriously whimsical decisions of something so important but i did n't listen to my gut .
now that i think about it i believe they were probably taking some sort of statistical data as gospel truth with what makes money as the deciding factor as to what the game really needs .
i think about three times i 've come back to this game and heroes/mechanics that were the core of this game were completely reworked .
shit feng mao went from being pretty cool with his passive and 4 abilities to losing an ability and gaining a way dumbed down passive in my year and a half of playing which would be fine if as an experienced played i could figure out why the hell they did that .
the multitude of changes like these were largely weird and unexplainable to me .
i felt the devs were more than willing at any moment to pivot on any decision .
i feel kinda dumb and in hindsight this game was run absolutely terribly designed astonishingly beautifully .
remember the rng switch up that had that epic blowback ?
that totally was the last nail in severogs bed .
thinking back it solidified what the devs were really committed to do from day one .
i wonder if the only reason paragon failed is because there was n't another game 's core to copy completely and implement .
maybe this is what happens when they actually try to make a game work on its own .
from my understanding fortnites core game is not the reason it blew up .
can you imagine its success right now if saves the world was the only mode ?
call me out if i got my facts wrong here but seems a glaring reason .
from the fan support right now of the games life continuing right now i feel there 's still hope .
i just pray something good comes from all this if its little as knowing how easy it is to destroy something beautiful .
based on the comment you chose to reply to i was expecting this to end with tree-fiddy undertaker throwing mankind off hell in a cell or your dad beating you with jumper cables .
to be honest he played the other day with the lakers and looked too slow .
maybe it 's the camera angle that makes it seem like he 's getting higher off the ground but i 'm not sure he is .
easy skip without even seeing their gameplay ? yoruichi can have very fast strong attacks and a massive aoe on them and you would dismiss her even before her gameplay is out ?
summonig circle should not be able to copy spy and everybody should be starting with extra spy next to the leader .
this approach would solve the rng spy problem and would also free '' all your silver slots
i think if there is still a commitment to each other we still have the emotional sexual bond maybe it 's not that crazy ?
it 's not crazy as long as you 're certain that the commitment and mental emotional and sexual bonds are there from her and that you 'd be ok with her stepping out '' once in a while .
it sounds like both of you are approaching this with maturity so there 's no reason it could n't work if you wanted to make it work .
people in this sub do n't really understand or support them but you can find information elsewhere .
discuss what you 're comfortable with and what you 're not .
what are the parameters of the new relationship model ?
since you 're going off-script everything needs to be discussed explicitly .
does she have to tell you about the stepping out ?
should she never tell you about the stepping out ?
how often should you check in with each other ?
the worst that happens is that you break up again .
but that 's a risk you take when starting any relationship .
do you think the odds of that have changed ?
has she and you learned something from the experience ?
if so no reason not to try the new paradigm .
to be fair the game really shouldnt show that much blood if it isnt going to reward you at all

just a reminder for all the people that will come here to defend drunk driving laws
if our ultimate goals are to reduce driver impairment and maximize highway safety we should be punishing reckless driving more consistently .
it should n't matter if it 's caused by alcohol sleep deprivation prescription medication text messaging or road rage .
if lawmakers want to stick it to dangerous drivers who threaten everyone else on the road they can dial up the civil and criminal liability for reckless driving especially in cases that result in injury or property damage .
doing away with the specific charge of drunk driving sounds radical at first blush but it would put the focus back on behavior where it belongs .
the punishable act should be violating road rules or causing an accident not the factors that led to those offenses .
singling out alcohol impairment for extra punishment is n't about making the roads safer .
it 's about a lingering hostility toward demon rum .
a five-year review of dog-bite injuries from the children 's hospital of philadelphia published in 2009 in the journal plastic and reconstructive surgery found that almost 51 percent of the attacks were from pit bulls almost 9 percent were from rottweilers and 6 percent were from mixes of those two breeds. https www.livescience.com/27145-are-pit-bulls-dangerous.html

if you cremate a body it takes 3 hours for the process .
it would take 25 years to cremate 6 million people without taking a single break .
so either there should have been open cremation pits where many people are cremated at once which we have no evidence of or this is just a big lie .
the laws are not there so that events do n't occur again .
the laws are there so that anyone who questions the official narrative gets punished .
yes google has a team to combat holocaust deniers .
i think this propaganda was also used to suppress jewish people .
that many of their ancestors were killed which means they are not fit to fight themselves or are a meek race which i dont believe .
the agenda was more aggressively pushed in 70s by the cia .
the whole holocaust theory was pushed more in this period .

it 's funny i really disliked season 2 i know a lot of people liked it but they seemed to be going everywhere at once and not making a lot of sense to me so i went into season 3 with the attitude of i 'll watch it for completion but that 's all and it totally sucked me in .

i switched to 1.2 at 1400dpi yes crazy high got used to it and still progressed in getting better at surfing .
just get confortable with any sens and keep on surfing and you will improve .
a single donkey usually a jennet sometimes a gelding is introduced to the herd and undergoes a bonding stage .
after it has bonded with the sheep it will protect them against canine predators fox coyote dogs as it would one of its own .
this is extremely beneficial in areas where the sheep have many acres to graze .
the advantage of the donkey over the guard dog is that they can eat the same food as the sheep so they do n't have to be fed separately .
the donkey will also bed down with the sheep at night .
given a strange sound it will voice a warning to the flock which alerts them to danger .
then the donkey will chase and often trample the predator .
i could just see this being turned into some kind of movie in the future .
that donkey concocting a plan to lead his flock to freedom only to be thwarted by the black and whites .

do n't spam him but you may have to ask a second time if he does n't see you the first happened with me .
he should confirm for you that your account is queued for a reset .
they are manually resetting people 's accounts who have had the ping pong ball issue .
i submitted a support ticket several weeks back but had n't heard anything .
as soon as i contacted kraiklyn two days ago he told me i was put in queue and it was resolved within 24 hours .
note that this is a one-time complimentary account reset and the issue is not yet fixed .
so be very careful with saving loadouts in the mobiglass to make sure it does n't happen again .

i do n't doubt that you think your interpretation of christian scripture is the best one .
the frequency with which atheists identify the normative orthodox theological stance i explain as my '' interpretation is striking .
there 's nothing in the actual text that unambiguously supports your statement here
there 's a lot that unambiguously supports my claim .
i 'm going to put these two statements together because they beautifully illustrate a point
perhaps you 've read the bible and perhaps you have n't but reasonable people have no room to disagree about this .
the god '' character in the old testament killed far more people than hitler—over 2 million that are explicitly numbered plus the entire populations of multiple cities where numbers are n't given not to mention the whole flood thing where he killed literally everyone in the world except eight people .
the fact is i never said i was quoting hitler that was a statement of what he believed not in any way meant to be a quote .
the source on this the the extension of the nazi party institute for the study and eradication of jewish influence on german church life institut zur erforschung und beseitigung des jüdischen einflusses auf das deutsche kirchliche leben https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/institute_for_the_study_and_elimination_of_jewish_influence_on_german_church_life .
this is their flag https imgur.com/a/h2ygn and it 's founder walter grundmann in his book jesus the galilean .
i put these together because i think you read what you wanted to read in what i said as it was far easier to refute .
likewise i think hitler and a great number of internet atheists choose to read what they want of the conquest of canaan .
let me ask you this question why would the amalekites amorites etc be mentioned around the time of david if the israelites had literally killed all of them hundreds of years earlier during the conquest ?
have you considered that the language used is an apocalyptic and hyperbolic way to state that god judged and defeated those nations via israel ?

this being said sometimes i agree sometimes i dont .
but there are too many dumb parrots who cherry pick crap he says so i hate when he shows up on reddit etc .

you 're going to waste a lot of time running across the entire map every time you need to sharpen your weapon .

if you run out of money and this sounds like a joke but i swear it 's not there are a lot of edible weeds like dandelions .

common ones that might be around you are dandelions common plantain cleavers aka bedstraw and sheep sorrel all edible raw or cooked and the entire plant is good to eat .
be absolutely certain of your identification before you eat anything and always start by only eating a very small amount and only try one new plant at a time .

this happened towards the end of my decade in the pizza industry .
apologies for length and there 's a tl dr below .
i was working as the general manager of a pizza place that loves the letter h and alliteration .
a little backstory is needed to truly understand the climax of this story .
as general manager i was paid salary meaning i was paid the same amount every week regardless of the hours i put in .
i was expected to work at least 50 hours per week including mandatory closing on sunday nights because inventory was due .
this was awful as an nfl fan working less than 60 hours was considered lazy by the district manager and was n't worth the ass-chewing that followed every week .
this particular day was new year 's eve which fell on a tuesday and while most holidays increase revenue by a good bit it was a tuesday night and that was my only guaranteed day off every week due to my shift managers having school schedules that i agreed to work around because they were good shift managers .
so i write the schedule and have not one but both of my shift leaders working that day along with all my drivers and my best inside crew to handle the bump in sales .
i trained my crew to run like a well oiled machine so that on my 1 or maybe 2 if i 'm lucky days off each week i could trust that the store would run without me .
so the stage is set new year 's eve tuesday morning .
i 'm on the couch with my roommate/best friend rick playing video games when we both receive and email from our district manager .
at this point i should point out that my rick is also a general manager for the same company at a different location .
this email from the district manager flat out stated that all general managers were required to work 8am-close regardless of the already approved schedules he had reviewed the previous week .
obviously i 'm pissed and so is rick since we both schedule in a similar fashion giving ourselves the slowest day of the week off .
despite being royally pissed we both get dressed and head to our respective stores .
after a few hours of sitting around waiting for the holiday rush '' to hit i realize that this job is not worth the 70 hours a week i regularly commit to it .
i draft up a resignation email to my district manager and i am a moment 's away from clicking send when i get a phone call .
rick tells me that he just quit and is leaving his store to fend for itself !
this only strengthens my resolve and instead of an email i call my district manager directly .
he answers and is audibly flustered by the news of one of his store managers quitting on new year 's eve .
much to my satisfaction i hit him with the news that i too will be leaving immediately and never coming back .
i dont quite remember exactly what he said but the panic in his voice was so satisfying to hear .
so rick and i went to our favorite bar ate wings and drank beer without a care in the world for the first time in months .
the fallout to my store was minimal as i mentioned before the store was effective without me and could run pretty well without my direct supervision .
rick 's store on the other hand was a different story his decision quit caused a chain reaction and more than half of the employees quit immediately after finding out that their beloved leader had abandoned ship .
one of rick 's employees who is still our friend to this day relayed a tale of 3 hour delivery times pissed off customers and a district manager who ended up working open or close shifts at rick 's store for the better part of two weeks while he shuffled managers around and tried to find replacements for us both .
district manager forces all his store managers to work open to close on a tuesday holiday me and my best friend rick who are both store managers quit without notice forcing the district manager to cover shifts at both stores for two weeks royally fucking him over .
i want to see the entire world in my lifetime .
very willing to apply to farms that maybe not many people desire to go to .
not interested in 'hot spots ' so much as places that might actually need more help .
i 'm sure i could take accurate guesses so it 's not a big deal .
social media wants to censor patriots ... thats ok ... time to censor the damn news ... everyone cancel their cable subscriptions that include corrupt cable news networks ... we are doneeee with their lies .
when like a million damn people drop their subscriptions thattttt should get some damn attention and send a very louddd message to the corrupt paid off companies ...
plus drop all online subscriptions to the washington post and other known fake news networks..
the stormmmmm just got a whole hell of alot stronger .
tl dr – i do n't think emc has as good an upside in one or two years as other lps like ogi or mari .
i 'm responding a bit to this post by u/namtab1985 https www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/7te0ci/seeing_a_lot_of_bullish_napkin_math .
s he is not wrong in the sentiment that all the envelope maths seems to be uniquely positive .
so i 'm going to try my hand at it for emblem cannabis corp .
my disclosure currently hold 90 000 december 2019 warrants .
i can crunch and analyze numbers but i could use the help to figure out what these numbers mean or to figure out whcih metrics to use .
also still learning the ways of markdown hint me up folks .
current production 2 000 kg out of a 23 500 ft^2 facility
fully funded production 15 000 kg 17k kg total by eoy 2018
potential proceeds exercise of options 105 million let 's call this in addition to the 85 mil but that is not perfectly clear .
either 5 or 5 000 per month whatever that means units litres ml bottles .
we all thought that if the initial price were around 2.00-2.50 we 'd be all over that .
the pump was real https www.wealthdaily.com/articles/emblem-cannabis-corporation-is-ready-to-ipo/8439 but the initial price expectation was reasonable .
come ipo and an opening price of 2.50 it peaked at 4.50ish before slowly inexorably tumbling down to the 1.50 2.00 range for most of the year .
sp is down from high of 4.50 about a year ago .
as low as 1.46 but recently rebounded to recent high of 2.65 .
there is ambiguity in their production numbers and it 's been hard to find the real deal .
in the end i think that this spreadsheet https docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mzyactukvwg3e4ztucvu-khcpzny8teej3jx-aj0o_q/htmlview upon which many of us at least look at needs to be revised .
here i 'll depend on emblem 's own q3 2017 financials http emblemcorp.com/blog/emblem-announces-third-quarter-2017-financial-results .
current production end of 2017 1 650 kg phase 1 3 of 4 rooms of phase 2
immediate future production q3 2018 2 000 kg phases 1 and 2
long term part deux phase 2 200 000 more square feet
no real elaboration yet about how this will be done or funded .
presumably with the 85 million in the war chest ?
2 400 ' vegetation rooms 3 200 ' cultivation 6 800 ' cultivation phase 2 10 500 ' admin vault etc .
so it takes 5 ft^2 produces 1 kg per year .
i 'm no expert but that 's kind of a lot is n't it ?
insider ownership in an undated investor presentation from 2017 13
inside ownership in their january 2018 presentation is given as 22 an increase .
this is as a result of their 50 mil bought deal closing february 2018 .

emblem projects 75 million revenue from phase 1 paris road
avoiding the calcualtions using cogs ebitda and p/b and that would be an interesting conversation let 's just look at conservative numbers for earnings per gram .
honestly there are so many variables affecting the calculation that i do n't think using an earnings per gram approach is not much worse and likely just as accurate as doing it the long way ?
can we all agree that 1 earnings per gram is a reasonable starting point ?
let 's talk about modifiers to this rate in comments if you wish .
for example i do n't they 'll have lower production costs than say mari or ogi which are campaigning on that fact .
and the hidden assumption is that earnings will equal profit although that is not absolutely certain .
i think and what do i know that it could be similar to that of the alcohol industry which and again what do i know i am told is 20 .
and it could well end up being higher fb is 36 amzn is 357 .
present 2018 implied sp is 0.28 87 lower than current sp at present number of shares issued .
shit clearly we 're banking on next year's production but for this year valuation is crazy .
what were they thinking last year with an ipo sp of 2.50 ?
in other words we 're operating at a pe of 195 to justify the current sp .
end of 2019 assuming all goes well targets met etc .
implied sp fully diluted 1.39 or a pe of 23 to justify the current sp .
this might well be the priced in '' sp .
end of 2020 70 000 kg production much more subject to not being met
i think this year 's completed production which wo n't actually affect the bottom line until january 2019 is priced in at a reasonable '' pe .
if we presume a more aggressive pe the current existing sp is perhaps justified for the present levels of production .
production ramp up is slow for emc as compared to the other lps .
do this same calculation for ogi and mari and the implied sps get increasingly better .
but overall i do n't think this napkin math tm is anything to write home about .
so i 21m drive semi for a living which i 'm honestly not sure how much longer i 'm gon na be doing it as it just seems like i should be living more of a life but the money is great .
i suck when it comes to dating and have n't really dated in a while .
i am very awkward when it comes to talking to women i like and i kind of self implode at a point and it seems like it just all falls apart .
i 've had friends tell me to try some of these dating apps tinder meetme which do n't ever seem to actually pan out .
i do n't really get to just go out ever due to work and where i am staying at currently i do n't really know anyone to even try and go out and be social .
just wondering how people in situations such as mine actually meet people .
it is time for me to upgrade from an encore to something better .
i see espresso in my future but maybe not for another year .
the virtuoso model 586 supposedly has the same burrs as the preciso and as i understand it these are different than the virtuoso burrs that many fit onto the encore correct ?
another thing i am not certain about is the refurbished virtuoso on baratza 's site does not include whether it is a 585 or 586 model .
considering buying it on sale right now and just wanted to make sure it 's still active .
with splatoon 2 i 've mostly just played turf war and the splatfests i imagine i 'll just play the most popular arms stuff .
here is my ballot me just trying to help boost my favorite characters xd
i am going to use an arbitrary and emotional wrong for this so no tangible elements can be expressed making it a bit tougher .
so let 's say that you are with a partner in a romantic relationship it is a closed-relationship and they step outside of that relationship and 'cheat ' on you .
this is an interesting problem to me because it seems to be rather difficult to fit into nihilism after one 's emotions have subsided .
being considered a victim because someone did something without your permission with their own body in a world where fidelity and fealty do not matter by means of philosophical positioning seems impossible .
how does one justify being wronged in a sense where there is no direct tangible harm or direct involvement in a scenario ?
i am taking both me 2020 and me 2030 together along with a chem course .
i am finding it to be difficult to manage my time to get to all the material for each course due to 2030 being a major time consumer .
would it be good to drop 2020 to make more time for 2030 and then pick it back up in the fall ?
i am planning on going into civil engineering instead of mechanical engineering .
it was so awkward idk what to do ! ! !
anyone selling any tickets to the tennis show at terminal west on 1/29 ?
i know i can get this off amazon i would rather buy it locally .
it 's one that could fit into a dvd drive .
so this comes from a submission yesterday https www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/7t5qr0/8_philosophical_thought_experiments_illustrated of 8 philosophical thought experiments .
many commenters expressed frustration with one called the sleeping beauty '' thought experiment as if it were either a silly piece of wordplay or else an example of philosophers being unable to understand basic probability .
i initially felt that way but after looking at it more carefully i found it to be a deeper problem than it seems at the surface .
sleeping beauty let 's call her sb from now on volunteers to undergo an experiment and she 's aware of all the details .
in this experiment she will be put to sleep .
based off a fair coin flip she will either be woken and put back to sleep once heads or twice tails .
each time she 's put back to sleep she 's given a drug that erases her memory of her awakening .
now each time she 's woken up she will be asked one question how confident are you that the coin flip was heads ? ''
none of the other details of this thought experiment seem to change that .
sb 's answer should be that the odds are half that the coin landed on heads .
this means there is a 1/3 possibility that she woke up to heads and 2/3 that she woke up to tails .
there are many ways to understand this so let me first provide an intuition pump
say the odds were changed so that if tails sb would be woken up 100 times .
let 's say she gets to bet 1 each time she wakes up .
if she chooses to bet on tails every time she might win 100 dollars but if she chooses to bet on heads every time she can only win 1 at most .
the 100 and the 1 are equally likely based off the coin flip so it makes sense for her to bet on tails .
another way to look at it is to consider if the experiment were repeated 1000 times .
so she will be woken up 500 times for heads and 1000 times for tails .
any time she 's woken up it makes sense that her possibility of waking up to heads is only 1/3 .
so why do some people still think the probability is 1/2 ?
let 's modify the experiment in a way similar to the above .
instead of asking sb how confident she is that the coin flipped heads let 's ask her whether she think 's it was heads or tails .
let 's even say that she understands probability and chooses tails .
when the experiment is concluded there are two equal possibilities either heads or tails .
the detail that she gave the correct answer twice if they flipped tails is irrelevant giving the right answer twice in a row does n't make you twice as right .
then let me provide another variation of the thought experiment you can skip the next three paragraphs if you 're already onboard and want to get to the conclusion already
edit i crossed out the part below because i think it 's distracting people from the point i 'm trying to make
before going to sleep our sleeping beauty is offered a chance to bet whether the coin is heads or tails .
the odds are 50/50 so it does n't matter what she bets right ?
however what if when she wakes up she is offered the chance to rescind her bet ?
according to probability she should rescind the bet if it was heads 1/3 probability but not if it was tails 2/3 probability .
it 's obvious that she did n't improve her odds .
she has a 50/50 chance before going to sleep and if she bets heads then she ends up taking it back .
come wednesday the odds have n't changed the chance is still 50/50 regardless of what she bet .
her decision to take back the bet if it was heads made sense from the basic math described above yet her decision did n't actually end up improving her odds.
the actual wording of the experiment is how confident are you that the coin flip is heads '' ?
the odds of heads are 50 and no detail of the thought experiment has changed that .
yes what i called the naive '' solution is correct .
so how did the more sophisticated thinkers end up at the incorrect answer ?
perhaps they 'd been conditioned by the monty hall problem to think about these questions a certain way .
they answered the question how confident are you that you woke up to a heads coin flip ? ''
every instance of them waking up has a 1/3 of being caused by a heads coin flip but that does nothing to change the objective reality that the actual probability of the coin flip has never changed from 50/50 .
the answer to this thought experiment seems obvious to me now that i 've spelled it out but belief in the 1/3 position is still the most common .
in my opinion the greatness of this thought experiment is in illustrating the dangers of rushing to conclusions and the ambiguity of language .
perhaps just a silly piece of wordplay after all .
just curious what everyone is running and what hash rate you are getting ?
i am running a evga gtx 780ftw and getting 212 kh/s
before tonight we were only after a bench wing .
abrines 2nd round pick would have got us someone like alec burks .
now we need a starting quality wing with good defense the question is whether we can get that player without a 1st to trade .
bradley would be perfect but we simply wo n't get him without a 1st but we could get him with ferguson .
would presti trade ferguson to get bradley as a rental ?
i really hope it does n't come to that because ferg is showing a heap of potential and hopefully we can get someone like garrett temple for abrines singler 2nd round pick .
we 're all in this season so the question is how all in do we go now ?
so i am senior in high school who is looking to get into mining during college .
i do not pay for electricity if i live in dorms so everything i make off hash rate i keep .
i 'm super budget because i 'm 18 but i have a bit extra i could spend and mine in college .
the cheaper the better but i want to be very efficient .

i then clicked create download account '' and then link download account '' which results in the message i 've posted .
i do n't know my old/previous password hence the password reset .
has anyone experienced this error and been able to locate the issue ?

eh it makes sense this country is built on racism on many powerful american figures/businessmen were deeply connected to the nazi regime .

i bought a used mid-century headboard recently not dissimilar to this one https www.chairish.com/product/503602/milo-baughman-chrome-primavera-wood-headboard .
and at the moment i only have a goofy 20 frame i got off of amazon .
this guy sits quite low and with this frame i need a box spring .
at the point i add the mattress i have about 6 inches of headboard left .
generally speaking should i assume the idea here is that these are meant for a low frame which does n't require a box spring ?
at that weight are there frames that can support it and i can simply attach the bottom of the headboard to the bottom of the frame and let it sit off the ground ?
it does n't seem like it but figured i should ask .
around 17 years ago a met this guy at a party .
i liked him right away and felt like we really clicked .
he was easy to talk to and being socially awkward i never found strangers easy to talk to .
he had a girlfriend i had a boyfriend and it never got past some very light flirting .
i ended up seeing him around once or twice and eventually he sort of ended up in my group of friends .
he cheered me up when i was sad and watched bad movies with me .
i was in love with him in a kind of pathetic way and he knew it .
but he was just out of a long term relationship and not looking for another one blah blah blah .
i met someone else who was unreservedly into me and it was so nice that i did n't pay much attention to a lot of red flags .
i ended up pregnant then married to an emotionally abusive asshat with vastly different core values than myself .
i still thought about and had dreams about the other guy regularly probably at least monthly if not more .
later on i found out that he had liked me too that some of our friends even tried to get asshat guy to bow out .
he might have confessed love to me when i was drunk valium which i do n't recommend goddamn i was stupid in my youth but i did n't remember it and i 'm still not entirely sure it happened .
he did n't even live in the same state anymore when all of this came to light .
my marriage was awful for a lot of reasons so that was sort of salt in the wound .
i had had such shitty self-esteem that it had honestly never occurred to me that i had a shot .
finally i got my shit together enough to leave dumb fuck and got full custody of the kiddo and the whole deal and i eventually landed in a relationship with a non-asshat .
but i have never been able to get this guy out of my head .
i still dream about him regularly and when i do i spend about a week thinking about him and letting regret and what if '' naw at me .
at this point we have not known each other for a long time .
we are both completely different people than we were back then .
i 'd like to think a confession to strangers would maybe help it go away but haaaahaha we all know that 's not gon na happen .
tl dr i 've had a crush on a guy for almost two decades i might 've had a chance with him but did n't know it and i blew it spectacularly and i ca n't get the fuck over it .
i just want to start off by saying i know a common suggestion is therapy .
one i have been seeing since 2016 for childhood related trauma severe bullying .
i 'm hoping to get some insight to work on my issue through therapy perhaps from someone who 's been through something similar .
my life 's pretty good if i think about it objectively .
my job pays me well and is n't too stressful .
i 'll pay off my student debt within a year of graduation .
because of all of the people i 'm close to i seem to be the worst off emotionally .
every single one of my friends has solid support in 1/3 if not 3/3 of these areas
family i am currently the sounding board for the only three i see it 's a depressing situation there
friends i have some but it 's not solid .
i do n't feel comfortable venting as much as i 'd actually like to .
i know other people have these issues but it feels like a lie because it 's not anyone i know they 're all better off than i am .
this upsets me and makes it hard for me to interact with my friends/colleagues .
i used to shut down from the stress of this but i 've gotten a lot better .
the thing is i know my needs are n't wrong .
at the same time i also know i do n't deserve anyone 's love .
and it frustrates/saddens me that the one thing i need most is out of my control that i ca n't just go to the doctor or the store to solve this issue .
i feel like it would do me some good to see that other people are struggling too .
but i ca n't just go around asking the people i know to tell me how these elements in their life suck .
i know the grass is greener '' but i truly do n't see how my grass is greener when i realize i have all this stuff going on but no one to share it with .
i want to be a better support to my friends .
but i can not compete with their families and sos .
i feel like a third or lower tier to all the people i have in my first tier .
i only see my therapist once a week for one hour .
we need to actually do work i ca n't just be venting .
i write in my journal as often as possible .
i know this is dumb i know there are people starving and dying and in danger .
i know i need a reality check but i ca n't get out of my head enough to find it .
i 'm also open to meditation suggestions if you have any .
i am looking for suggestions on how to deal with my anger and sadness at having seemingly less support in my social circle than everyone i regularly interact with .
i am single and unready to date so i have no so .
my family is not a place i can turn to for support right now .
looking for advice comments viewpoints and perhaps meditation suggestions .
no one cared last year or year before that .
now all the sudden we feel the need to show just how much we care about those poor brown people .
right-wingers have two words for that that are right in this case virtue signalling .
instead of asking others to prove something isn't true prove to them that it is true by producing evidence .
i think you wo n't because you and i both know you 're full of shit .
that does n't mean evidence does n't exist it means that you do n't have it and you do n't even know for a fact if any exists .
but you 'll come here and attack anyone who points that out then cry about personal attacks '' .
you are what 's wrong with hacks on both sides .
you 're either a complete moron or a troll .
im finished the first ee non-lethal challenge but my rule was to kill bosses only if i cant finish them otherwise .
i used gun on ocelot killed the fury sooo hard and the pain .
i cqc-d the boss that was fun somehow poisoned the fear and tried the clock trick on the old man .
i cqc-d volgin but used rpg on the shagohod and managed to use only tranq on volgins last form .
so i think the total kill count should be 2 .
but my kill count number at the end was 4 ...
when i was at the sorrow only the bosses appeard and no other soldiers .

i use a custom name list and custom portrait on my fanatic materialist nation and on every game i get the flesh is weak accession perk the new species that is created always changes name list to humanoid 1 instead of keeping the old one .
i 've tried to look through the files to find anything different from my name list and a vanilla name list to no success .
if anyone have had a similar problem and solved it or has some experience modding i just follow guides on the internet and have no real idea what i 'm really doing help would be greatly appreciated .

apparently cosrx changed the label packaging of their advanced snail 96 mucin power essence again .
the label on the bottle is different than any other labels i see in other pictures online including cosrx website .
also the english wording on the label is odd and with some misspellings .
it says being 96 snail secretion filtrate mucin this essence helps the skin to loose less moist while keeping the skin smooth and healthy . ''
i purchased it from jolse and when i messaged them about it they said its 100 original and that is the new packaging .
i just sat through 5 competitive skirmishes that all ended in a black screen with error starting game trying again '' that never start .
finally on the sixth time i actually get put in a game .
however i am somehow matched up with two bronze players despite the fact that i am platinum and everyone on the other team is platinum or gold .
the error screen and matchmaking have been terrible over the past couple weeks .
might also be interested in a flawless karambit of some sort .
the m4a4 howl https s.metjm.net/xaeomi2.jpg and ak-47 fire serpent mw https s.metjm.net/qooopqz.jpg very clean im mostly just interested in pure keys for .
so initially i tried the demo of eu4 a few months ago i hated it .
after watching playthroughs doing research this subreddit is an amazing resource i bit the bullet bought the game with a few dlcs .
i started off as castille because everyone seemed to agree it was as straightforward as it gets .
i had a good start with friendly portugal aragon the iberian wedding triggering .
unfortunately france england hated me right off the bat so i found it difficult to find other alliances .
i had a pu over aragon naples which enabled me to attack morocco secure granada .
i was focusing so hard on getting my legitimacy back after ditching the useless heir that i think i missed a lot of the building development .
somehow i ended up with the burgundian succession as well which i did n't quite understand they formed an alliance with aragon .
i vassalize portugal which takes two wars i 'm ready to form spain diplomatically with my pu over aragon but i did n't realise madiera existed which was now sunni .
before i can attack morocco aragon burgundy have attacked me morocco see their opportunity as well .
naples gets trampled all over by the ottomans i end up losing my pus and portgual .
i went from almost forming spain to losing everything .
gradually i build everything back up with a vengeance to get back at aragon .
i start colonising the caribbean a colony forms out there but they prove to be pretty hopeless .
i work on improving my trade increasing taxes manpower .
i try attacking aragon but their alliances with burgundy austria england are too good i have to white peace .
i need more manpower to attack aragon again so i try vassalizing portugal once more .
halfway through this i realise i can claim the throne to france but only if i give up the portuguese war now to gain the extra prestige needed to overtake france .
so i claim the throne to see what happens even though i probably could have taken more of portugal .
some confusing things happen i 'm excommunicated by england who are papal controller but then france enters a pu with me because of a royal marriage !
things are looking brighter although i realise there 's no hope in hell i can reduce their liberty desire .
aragon attacks me poland attacks france i white peace the poland-sucession war the war with aragon is super close .
i lasted until 1602 it took about 26 hours i do n't think i did too bad for a first game .
going to have another crack at castille form spain as soon as i get the opportunity .
the last student i have taken account of about his weirdness was probably light .
well he is the same old light who keeps all his thoughts to himself his family and a small circle of nerd friends .
unlike last year light now knows how to greet me whenever he sees me .
at least he now knows how to flash a shy silent hi whenever we run across each other at school .
meeting light and his otaku gang really awakened the nerd in me .
this year more weird kids trying to overcome their social anxiety showed up in my life .
the worst or i should probably say the best and probably the weirdest among the bunch is kento yamazaki of grade 8 .
at first meeting i have already sensed his nerd aura from the look of his droopy eyes hidden behind his dark-framed glasses his pale white skin his disheveled hair and crouching posture .
i can still remember how hesitant he was to partake in the getting-to-know activity that i had during the first day of class this year .
i had a human bingo about my students ' interests and he claimed nobody in the classroom would match what he wrote down since he believed that nobody can relate to him .
well i already forgot what he wrote down but weeks after that i saw him standing his signature l stance during dismissal time at the high school gate probably waiting for his driver .
i casually asked him have you watched ‘death note ' because you are standing like l ? although he replied with his usual jabbers i found him one day bugging me with the question do you watch hentai ? well he kept asking me that same question until he went into hiatus in the u.s. for a month .
whenever i ask him why he kept asking me that he would say well you 're the only teacher who would n't send me to the disciplinary officer when i ask that question. true enough i do n't and i still have n't gotten mad at any of his pranks .
although he keeps pestering me i just do n't get annoyed .
in fact i want him to talk to me more .
during the first quarter i learned from his classmates how big of a whack he is .
they said he eats pieces of paper fresh leaves withered leaves barks of trees and even licks the sink at the school 's bathroom .
everyone in the class thinks there must be something wrong with him psychologically .
although i 'd like to believe them hearing these weird-ass stories about kento-chan sounded more appealing to me .
i learned from his classmates that he was n't like this when he was in elementary .
his classmates told me that he was so quiet and did n't interact much with people .
and he still chooses the people he talks to .
another kento yamazaki legend i heard not only from his classmates but also from his parents was his bad experience with his chinese teacher back when he was still in grade 5 .
unlike other geek students that i have kento is an underperforming one not because he is dumb or slow but because he is kento who seems to be demotivated and has the tendency to drift off during class discussions .
according to his father his chinese teacher got mad at him one day because he did n't do a seatwork well he never does one in my class too unless i talk and encourage him personally so he was sent out by his teacher .
to put into context his father 's interpretation his laoshi collared him and he was thrown out of the classroom .
kento is the youngest in a family with an overprotective father who by the way was a three-term mayor of a town in our province .
after learning his son 's demise he marched towards the school and scolded the poor taiwanese teacher who was later deported back to his home country .
another legend i heard about him was with his vision .
according to his parents his vision started deteriorating since he was in grade 5 but he was only diagnosed with astigmatism and nearsightedness this year .
like me he saw a blurred vision of the world for over three years .
his visual impairment probably contributed to his habitual inattentiveness inside the classroom .
from first to second quarters he claimed he was a vegan .
in fact he showed me his lunch box once and it had meat .
but still he went on relating his being vegan to almost all of our class activities .
this third quarter he keeps telling me almost every day that he hates english. i know he does n't .
in fact he never spoke a single hiligaynon a philippine dialect word in front of me .
but he claims he 's speaking the kento language .
for the past two weeks this kid has been pestering me since the day i told him about his miraculous feat in my class getting a perfect score in our long quiz and the day i started teasing him to his crush .
so i found out from his homeroom adviser that he has a crush on yuko a girl right across his seat who is as silent as he is .
and just yesterday i discovered from his parents that he has had a crush on her since grade 4 .
now that his little secret has been put out of the box he actually wants to be teased to his crush .
he claims he is now inspired as shown in his test scores and drive to copy notes .
i keep cheering him on his crush as long as it makes him a better person .
last week he told me he was trying to be normal .
i sarcastically replied that he was the most normal person i have ever known to which he laughed .
but i honestly could n't imagine kento camouflaging his true self in a sea of normal and oh-so-boring humans .
yesterday when we visited their house in a city just near the sugar central which is two hours away from the metro i discovered a lot about him .
i ‘kinda now know where a portion of his weirdness came from .
he has a half-brother who is decades older than him and now lives in the u.s .
he has another brother who is also older than him for more than a decade and is now a lawyer .
his father is very manly and came from a clan of politicos who shaped the province .
after his failed attempt to be re-elected into office in 2013 elections i think his dad settled in as the head of the sugar central .
their house like all other houses of my students that we 've visited is really nice .
the interior is a mixture of modern and antique designs and fixtures .
they have a number of maids all wearing uniform .
despite the elegance of their family and their house i however think that kento is lonely .
there are no kids around their neighborhood who plays with him .
he locks himself well like all other kids nowadays inside his room playing with the computer and talking to his virtual friends .
his only source of social interaction with people his age is in school .
that is probably why whenever he comes to steal my food and begs me to buy him more food and pesters me with his nonsense talks about how he hates my subject but does not like friday when there is no english i just flash a friendly smile at him .
when all his friends go home and he is alone he would usually go to the faculty room and talk to his teachers .
there you would see that he does not like to be left alone with nothing to do .
however some teachers start to become annoyed whenever he is around which i understand because he never stops talking and asking so many nonsense questions until you give him the snare .
on the other hand the weird me finds our nonsense conversation a bit annoying because it 's somehow a waste of time and a disruption from work yet enjoyable .
sometimes when he is sent out of the faculty room for lingering too much i would go out and talk to him outside about nonsense stuff again .
i 'd introduce him to a few of my students .
i even introduced him to boys in school who have the same name as his like kento chino yamashita and kento hanyu .
well chino noted his sarcasm and even likened it to sheldon cooper of the big bang theory to which i agreed .
his reply though was do n't compare me to the characters of your nerd shows miss.
i do n't know how will this end but one thing is for sure i would waste an hour a day listening to his sarcastic remarks because it takes my stress away .
after serenading him and his family with christmas songs i asked him to assess our performance and he said i almost cried because it was too bad. some might have gotten offended by his remarks but i know he always says the opposite of what he means like the i hate english ...
i 'll go here and annoy you on friday since we do n't have english.
he even once asked me to teach him how to write poetry for his crush .
if i were ready that time i would have taught him but his favor caught me off guard .
how would i teach somebody how to write his own thoughts ?
i even think he is better in english than i am .
the story is real but the names of the people involved were changed to keep their identities secret .
also if you noticed the names are japanese because i 'm a weaboo .
would love suggestions for a long mc let 's play on yt .
i 've previously watched some of welsknight and paulsoaresjr .
i am only on my third day and have woke up this morning with absolutely no urge to fap or look at porn .
this is the first time i 've woke up and not had a single urge to fap and look at porn .
could i only be on day 3 and in a flatline ?
it might sound strange but i hope i remain feeling this way for a long while because if i feel like this for another while i feel like it will be much easier to not fap to porn .
if it was a flatline though how long do they roughly last ?
but after log in the charts balances token lists wo n't load or take a long time to load .
the page is very unresponsive very laggy and my cpu consumption is very high slows down my whole pc with just 1 tab of bitfinex !
they have n't made any announcement regarding this yet !
i was in a 7 year relationship from 17-24 and have been single for nearly 3 years now .
i found myself in a whirlwind romance 6 months after my break up which i ended after 2 months due to the guy being controlling and after this experience and the end of the ltr i moved to a new city and took a year off from dating altogether to get my head straight .
since then i have dated a lot with the intent of finding a meaningful connection and relationship and have had so many disappointments .
i do n't have any issues finding men to date they think i 'm interesting attractive and intelligent however it seems that whenever things become more intimate with time they freak out and ghost or they 'll claim they are n't in a position to commit .
what really sucks is that the last 3 guys i have dated got really close to me and made themselves out to be really into it but ended up leaving me for another girl each time .
i do n't consider myself a superficial person by any means and i have dated quite a wide range of guys .
so overall i do n't feel my choice of men is the problem here .
although it ended for good reasons my relationship of 7 years was very healthy and my ex partner treated me really well so i came out of this relationship with a high level of self confidence that has been demolished from all these experiences .
as much as i hate being so 'woe is me ' this has made me feel like no one is ever going to love me again and like i do n't have anything to offer anyone anymore which is very different from how i felt about myself 2 years ago .
right now i am going to take a break from dating until i am in a better headspace but i feel i could do with some advice .
for those of you who have experienced a long string disappointment and hurt from dating after a long term relationship how did you move forward and keep your self-esteem in tact ?
also how do you protect yourself from getting hurt like this ?
i was in a ltr of 7 years from 17-24 and have been dating for 3 years and only have experienced constant rejection and hurt which has really affected my self-esteem .
for those who have experienced this how did you manage to keep your self-esteem in tact and protect yourself from getting hurt like this ?
if you are an indie developer how many time do you spend to make an app from nothing to publish on store ?
in my case it takes about 3 months included coding desinging preparing screenshots description on store etc ... is it so long ?
after spending a long time looking for a suitable gastly/haunter/gengar to power up i finally found a 100 gastly today .
the only issue is that it is only 225cp .
is it worth spending the dust and candy evolving and maxing out ?
so i saw someone say something in chat asking a general question and i wanted to answer it .
i thought maybe it was bugged so i did a mission .
i tried itin there pressing t and the chat opened up .
when the mission finished i tried again while i was on my ship and the same thing .
i am afraid of what the answer to this question is probably going to be and i hope i 'm wrong.. but.. do you have to pay to chat ?
secondary much less important atm i 'm wondering how do i customize my ship ?
like the image you see during the loading screen ?
i notice other players ships all look different i 'd like to change mine too .
but i 'm afraid the same thing ... it costs money does n't it ?
is anyway else concerned with the amount of content there will be in the full release ?
i do n't think i could get more than a month and a half out of this game after release considering it stays multiplayer only with the current twenty players per server .
it feels like an indie game with a triple a price .
but holy shit the organic waves and boat interaction is insane .
if they could some how have objects on the ship have real time physics and need to be tied down ... that would be actual perfection for a game like this .
it 's still a 9/10 the way it is it 's truly incredible
how many hours do you think you could get out of the game post release ?
this may seem like a very idiotic question to ask but i 'm feeling rather conflicted .
my birthday is this upcoming wednesday and since i was 19 i have n't been in a celebratory mood to do anything special or what i can even call special .
since my sister passed from when i was 20 i 've just felt empty and numb most days .
i do n't socialize and just find being out in public for too long just exhausting but i promised my therapist i would try to do better this year .
the last card my sister gave to me for my birthday says this
thank you for making it here thank you for continuing everyday .
the road might be long and hard but you 're getting there one step at a time .
i found it last year sorting through my closet and i just burst into tears cause my sister was adamant about me getting better with my mental health and wanting to connect with other people so i would n't be alone but its usually easier said than done .
i feel like i have n't accomplished anything to celebrate about especially as its a reminder that i 'm getting older but at the same time i do n't want to stay stuck like this .
my therapist is encouraging me to go out and spend the day for myself i have to go see her at 4 in the afternoon that day anyway so i wonder if it really will be a good idea or just a waste of my time/money .
tl dr turning 23 on wednesday feeling guilty about considering celebrating my birthday even though i have n't done anything worthwhile .
this is a thread for simple or common training questions that do n't merit their own individual threads as well as a place to ask injury related questions .
it also serves as a less intimidating way for new climbers to ask questions without worrying how it comes across .
i am on the road and had n't eaten in a while so i pulled in to hungry jacks to get an order of chips and asked against hope if they had anything vegetarian and much to my surprise the guy at the counter said they do a veggie whopper .
this is the place for all of those pictures that you 're eager to share with r/snowboarding but that do n't actually depict the act of snowboarding .
examples of this are selfies pictures from chairlifts pictures of your resort pictures of you sitting down on a slope vacation pictures pictures of park features scenery pictures etc .

i 'm doing a project comparing uwb localisation to wlan and need to connect multiple robots to mobilesim in order to track them .
however i 'm getting a headache trying to get even one robot to connect to mobilesim while i can get one connected to mobileeyes without a problem by running serverdemo .
i have a wireless dongle which is set up as an ad hoc network to which the robots are supposed to connect .
in serverdemo i specify the ip address of the robot i wish to control and then in mobileeyes specify the ip address of the ad hoc network and it connects .
while running serverdemo i ca n't connect to the robot through mobilesim no matter what ip or port i specify .
i 've seen people using mobilesim with multiple robots on youtube but there is no explanation on how they managed it .
i 'm hoping someone here might have worked on a similar project and might be able to provide some insight .
i wo n't be back in the lab until 1st feb so if i get any suggestions i wo n't be able to implement them until then but i 'll still feed back that afternoon .
someone commented on my profile that they would trade an m4 cyrex ft on their alt account for all my graffiti and cases https imgur.com/a/1lg0c which was a red flag immediately however i did n't think any scam was possible because they told me to send an offer .
i sent him an offer for the cyrex https imgur.com/a/zakny with only the 4 cases and 3 graffiti from me .
after i confirm the trade as shown in the video my knife somehow disappeared from my inventory https imgur.com/a/uckqv and it said that i put it in the trade offer even though when i offered the trade i did n't put the knife in .
it also shows in my trade history that i sent him the knife in the same trade .

when you put down miners do you put them for efficiency miners separated by their mining zones '' or for maximum throughput you put miners side by side disregarding their mining zones ''
because i found something that works for me when miners are separated by their mining zones i 've been able to work up a system to notify me when specific fields copper iron or stones miner/s ran out
but looking at youtube video tutorials people might not be interested in looking at the solution since they 're not building miners this way so how do you build yours ?

we 've got togheter in february in september she went to spain to study 6 months with an erasmus program i started a part time job in the same time while also going to university aswell cause i needed some extra money as my family was struggling economicaly .
because of how busy i was between work and uni i couldnt stay in contact with her as often as before but whenever i had some free time she was always the first one i contacted and tried to hear from .
after a month of this she started to be more and more distant text me less often to the point if i didnt text she wouldnt text at all .
because of this i became more and more clingy and she would get more distant discussion were more frequent and from how she was behaving she seemed like she was hiding something she even asked me for a break and that if i couldnt give her space and a break i didnt truly love her i gave it to her and fast forwad in november after a big fight caused by her behaviour and her statements she deletes and block me from her fb and ig .
so i decided to give her the space she needed with the hope maybe shed come back after 2 weeks she calls me at night telling me that she miss me and wanted to just talk i tought she was coming back or tought about reconciliation just to discover after 1 day of texting that she found someone else there while i was here going crazy over her she didnt loose time finding someone else she even change her whatsapp profile photo with one with him and told me how shes happy and how he treats her well i was heartbroken and devastated after seeing and reading that i litteraly felt physical pain in my chest .
after that i cut the conversation short and i wish her well and that she pass a good christmas with her new guy and her family it was my first serious relationship we are both 20 and i didnt know how to behave immediatly i go no contact with the hope to get over her after 3 weeks and 2 days before the new year she text me asking me you wont talk with me anymore ?
'' that was her first breadcrumps which i answer by saying no im getting into a new stage of my life and i think it would be better if we stay no contact i hope you respect my decision thank you take care and happy new year '' which she answerd with ok i was just wondering '' fast forward the first days of january she text me why we cant bee good friends ? ''
which i ignored yeasterday i reached 30 days of nc it was hard and i had to fight the urge to contact her many times but i stayed strong thanks to my sister mostly cause id go vent and talk with her whenever i felt down .
yeasterday she contacts me again texting me why you dont want to talk with me ? ''
which i ignored and then called me twice at night which reminded me the times i tried to call her and she ignored me during her needed break while i was out having a beer with my friends and i obviously didnt pick up .
now what makes me upset is the fact that she has to ask me why i dont want to talk with her she has the courage to text me and call me on whatsapp while having the same photo with that guy and expect me to answer or pick up she gave up on me and didnt want to be in a relationship with me anymore after playing with my feelings and treating me like a leftover i wont give her the privilege of beign my friend and my care also doesnt she has respect for her new guy ?
contacting and calling your ex to ask if you can stay friends ?
sorry for the long post or any typo but this subreddit helped me greatly and i just needed a place to vent im commited to keep no contact for life .
if you look at the design https vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/f/fe/ozpin 27s_cane.png/revision/latest ? cb=20160202135955 on the handle of the cane it almost looks like a diagram of gears with arrows showing which way each gear is turning .
it 's probably just an aesthetic thing but it 'd be neat if that were the diagram to the gears that were in ozpin 's office at beacon or something

after using it i noticed that shoryuken and other inputs are harder due to the square gate i understand buying a octagonal gate along with a better stick/buttons will improve the experience .
but is it actually worth it to train myself to use the arcade stick ?
is it really an advantage and/or a superior way to play ?

during my childhood my family was like a drop of water in a vast river never remaining in one location for long .
we settled in rhode island when i was eight and there we remained until i went to college in colorado springs .
most of my memories are rooted in rhode island but there are fragments in the attic of my brain which belong to the various homes we had lived in when i was much younger .
most of these memories are unclear and pointless – chasing after another boy in the back yard of a house in north carolina trying to build a raft to float on the creek behind the apartment we rented in pennsylvania and so on .
but there is one set of memories which remains as clear as glass as though they were just made yesterday .
i often wonder whether these memories are simply lucid dreams produced by the long sickness i experienced that spring but in my heart i know they are real .
we were living in a house just outside the bustling metropolis of new vineyard maine population 643 .
it was a large structure especially for a family of three .
there were a number of rooms that i did n't see in the five months we resided there .
in some ways it was a waste of space but it was the only house on the market at the time at least within an hour 's commute to my father 's place of work .
the day after my fifth birthday attended by my parents alone i came down with a fever .
the doctor said i had mononucleosis which meant no rough play and more fever for at least another three weeks .
it was horrible timing to be bed-ridden– we were in the process of packing our things to move to pennsylvania and most of my things were already packed away in boxes leaving my room barren .
my mother brought me ginger ale and books several times a day and these served the function of being my primary form of entertainment for the next few weeks .
boredom always loomed just around the corner waiting to rear its ugly head and compound my misery .
i do n't exactly recall how i met mr. widemouth .
i think it was about a week after i was diagnosed with mono .
my first memory of the small creature was asking him if he had a name .
he told me to call him mr. widemouth because his mouth was large .
in fact everything about him was large in comparison to his body– his head his eyes his crooked ears– but his mouth was by far the largest .
you look kind of like a furby i said as he flipped through one of my books .
mr. widemouth stopped and gave me a puzzled look .
you can pet and feed them almost like a real pet.
they are n't the same as having a real friend.
i remember mr. widemouth disappearing every time my mother stopped by to check in on me .
i do n't want your parents to see me because i 'm afraid they wo n't let us play anymore.
we did n't do much during those first few days .
mr. widemouth just looked at my books fascinated by the stories and pictures they contained .
the third or fourth morning after i met him he greeted me with a large smile on his face .
i have a new game we can play he said .
we have to wait until after your mother comes to check on you because she ca n't see us play it .
after my mother delivered more books and soda at the usual time mr. widemouth slipped out from under the bed and tugged my hand .
we have to go the the room at the end of this hallway he said .
i objected at first as my parents had forbidden me to leave my bed without their permission but mr. widemouth persisted until i gave in .
the room in question had no furniture or wallpaper .
its only distinguishing feature was a window opposite the doorway .
mr. widemouth darted across the room and gave the window a firm push flinging it open .
he then beckoned me to look out at the ground below .
we were on the second story of the house but it was on a hill and from this angle the drop was farther than two stories due to the incline .
i like to play pretend up here mr. widemouth explained .
i pretend that there is a big soft trampoline below this window and i jump .
if you pretend hard enough you bounce back up like a feather .
i was a five-year-old with a fever so only a hint of skepticism darted through my thoughts as i looked down and considered the possibility .
but that 's all a part of the fun .
it would n't be fun if it was only a short drop .
if it were that way you may as well just bounce on a real trampoline.
i toyed with the idea picturing myself falling through thin air only to bounce back to the window on something unseen by human eyes .
i do n't know if i have enough imagination .
mr. widemouth 's face contorted into a snarl but only for a moment .
he spent the rest of the day under my bed quiet as a mouse .
the following morning mr. widemouth arrived holding a small box .
i want to teach you how to juggle he said .
here are some things you can use to practice before i start giving you lessons.
my parents will kill me ! i shouted horrified that mr. widemouth had brought knives into my room– objects that my parents would never allow me to touch .
i 'll be spanked and grounded for a year !
knives are n't safe to just throw in the air.
he took the box of knives and slid under my bed remaining there the rest of the day .
i began to wonder how often he was under me .
mr. widemouth often woke me up at night saying he put a real trampoline under the window a big one one that i could n't see in the dark .
i always declined and tried to go back to sleep but mr. widemouth persisted .
sometimes he stayed by my side until early in the morning encouraging me to jump .
he was n't so fun to play with anymore .
my mother came to me one morning and told me i had her permission to walk around outside .
she thought the fresh air would be good for me especially after being confined to my room for so long .
ecstatic i put on my sneakers and trotted out to the back porch yearning for the feeling of sun on my face .
i have something i want you to see he said .
i must have given him a weird look because he then said it 's safe i promise.
i followed him to the beginning of a deer trail which ran through the woods behind the house .
i 've had a lot of friends about your age .
when they were ready i took them down this path to a special place .
you are n't ready yet but one day i hope to take you there.
i returned to the house wondering what kind of place lay beyond that trail .
two weeks after i met mr. widemouth the last load of our things had been packed into a moving truck .
i would be in the cab of that truck sitting next to my father for the long drive to pennsylvania .
i considered telling mr. widemouth that i would be leaving but even at five years old i was beginning to suspect that perhaps the creature 's intentions were not to my benefit despite what he said otherwise .
for this reason i decided to keep my departure a secret .
my father and i were in the truck at 4 a.m .
he was hoping to make it to pennsylvania by lunch time tomorrow with the help of an endless supply of coffee and a six-pack of energy drinks .
he seemed more like a man who was about to run a marathon rather than one who was about to spend two days sitting still .
early enough for you my father asked with a hint of sympathy ?
i nodded and placed my head against the window hoping for some sleep before the sun came up .
i felt my father 's hand on my shoulder .
i know it 's hard for you as sick as you 've been .
once daddy gets promoted we can settle down and you can make friends.
i opened my eyes as we backed out of the driveway .
i saw mr. widemouth 's silhouette in my bedroom window .
he stood motionless until the truck was about to turn onto the main road .
he gave a pitiful little wave good-bye steak knife in hand .
the piece of land our house stood upon was empty except for the foundation as the house burned down a few years after my family left .
out of curiosity i followed the deer trail that mr. widemouth had shown me .
part of me expected him to jump out from behind a tree and scare the living bejeesus out of me but i felt that mr. widemouth was gone somehow tied to the house that no longer existed .
the trail ended at the new vineyard memorial cemetery .
i noticed that many of the tombstones belonged to children .
antiobiotic resistance is a well documented phenomenon which is increasingly worrying to modern medicine .
one of the alternatives being investigated is bacteriophages but there are also ways bacteria could evolve to be resistant to them so it 's clear bacteria do their best to not get killed by whatever we happen to throw at them .
why does this not happen with regular widespread use of cleaning and disinfecting products ?
for example both in a healthcare and a domestic setting things like alcohol hand gel and bleach to clean surfaces are in common use but i 've never read of bacteria becoming immune to dettol .
will there still be mystery portal events and rux appearances when gw 3 comes out ?
as the title suggests i was in a spot where i could n't listen to the same old rocket league playlists on spotify anymore because most of them sound basically the same .
so i created a list of songs that are good old rock and kind of fit the feeling of driving a supersonic car and flying through the arena .
currently there are 44 songs in it which run for 2 hours and 38 minutes .
that might seem short but i really want all songs in this playlist to fit the feeling of the game .
of course this list is not perfect and i would really love to hear ideas to extend it with more songs for your enjoyment .

so the 500hz tape is 500hz at both ends on the good deck but slowly creeps up on the deck under test ?
i 'd look closely at the condition of the pinch roller on the dut .
make sure it 's still rubbery and that it makes solid contact with the capstan when in play .
if the pinch roller were n't making good contact with the capstan i would expect playback to speed up a bit or a lot over the course of the tape .
this is because the take-up reel is driven faster than the highest speed it ever has to turn which is right at the beginning when there 's no tape built up on the take-up spool .
the pinch roller presses the tape against the capstan which regulates tape speed .
the take-up has a slip clutch to allow it to turn slower than it 's being driven .
this puts tension on the tape between the take-up and the capstan .
if the tape slips at the capstan then the take-up will pull it across faster .
as the diameter of tape on the take-up increases the speed it would pull the tape at goes up for the same rate of spinning more length of tape per rotation .
when the tape slipped at the capstan it would be pulled faster on a fuller take-up spool .
so clean your capstan and pinch roller really well and check the condition of your pinch roller .

it baffles me how many people complain about ticket prices yet want a contending team .
ca n't have cheap tickets and a playoff team pick one .
it especially surprises me to see so many season ticket holders up in arms over their price raises .
yes some of the prices were raised by around 50 but how much better has the team gotten ?
how many times has your ticket price been noticeably raised ?
they 're still getting really good deals on the regular price of their seats and the resale value has skyrocketed .
my friend has season tix and was out of town for about 3 weeks .
sold almost every ticket he had for that 3 week stretch and nearly made his money back already .

what 's the difference between an ex-catholic and ex-mormon ?
for one thing growing up catholic is different than growing up lds and catholicism is a relatively low demand religion .
for catholics the sacraments are of the utmost importance which is why baptisms are performed as early as possible and priests are called to hear death bed confessions whereas in mormonism the ordinances are important but not as much as continually striving to improve one 's character and goodwill towards others .
the mormon church exerts more of an influence on your life which makes leaving it a bigger deal .
also catholics are a lot less concerned with their own history compared to mormons .
atrocities like the mountain meadows massacre can potentially be big stumbling-blocks for some members but most catholics are indifferent towards the inquisition a series of atrocities on a much larger scale .
people who leave the mormon church are more likely to do so because of events in the history of the church whereas as people who identify as ex-catholics are really going out of their way to separate themselves from the church think mark ruffalo 's character in spotlight

for instance oxygen free cables and coat hangers sound the same for double blind tests but one is audiophile grade and the other is not .
i consider things like oxygen free cables audiophoolery not audiophile .
but yeah i do think there are products out there that manage to combine convenience and sound quality to a degree where i 'd consider them audiophile friendly .
lg 's v20 and v30 are examples of this they 're very convenient but they went some extra lengths to ensure the sound quality was the best it can possibly be in that form factor .
that 's why you see so many of us get one you get the sound quality of the expensive daps out there in the form factor of a smartphone and since we all carry smartphones anyway why not get one with great sound quality ?
its dac is amazing and the amp section powerful enough to drive most of the headphones we headphiles usually like .
so there 's not much compromise going on not if you 're already limited to that form factor of a smartphone .
the wolfson dac was the same as the rio karma which is considered by many to be an audiophile grade player .
back then the rio karma was considered audiophile grade but is it still today ?
back then you used to get it for the sound quality first convenience second .
but today you 'd get something else so it 's no longer audiophile grade .
i used to love the sansa clips and used to think they sounded great but today i 'm not so excited about their sound quality since i 've moved on to better things .
i would n't consider them audiophile grade they do n't sound good enough and they 're too much about convenience and not enough about sound quality .

well what i mean is that increasing the supply usually decreases the price of a holding such as a stock split .
and while if there is a preset number that means the price per coin can go down .
now if the technology is viable and profitable the supply allows more typical investors to get in and therefore increase the price like when apple split its stock .
granted coins work different because of the mining aspects and underlying technology uses .

my response was n't for you specifically more to those who down voted my initial comment and those believers '' of chomsky .
i had 10 karma earlier in the bloody wikileaks subreddit .
i actually did a double take to see where i posted my comment !
not only does he refuse to entertain '' he damn right dismisses anyone who questions it as a crazy conspiracy theorist '' and statements like who cares '' will instantly make a whole bunch of his followers '' not care whether the it was an inside job '' or not .
i remember back in 2003 when i asked one of my smarter friends to watch loose change when it first came out .
my friend was one of the smartest kids i knew growing up and i valued his opinion he is a successful lawyer so you can imagine he is n't stupid however after doing his own research '' he told me he just listened to what chomsky had to say about the matter then agreed with his narrative and never questioned the events again .
as i am sure thousands of others have done the same

i just discovered hermitcraft recently within the past few months .
i only started playing minecraft about 1 1/2 years ago and had no idea what i was doing at first .
a few web searches led me to resources like the wiki reddit and eventually tutorial videos on youtube .
mumbo became my go-to guy when i decided to learn how to use redstone and automate things whenever i wanted to do something i 'd do a search on mumbo youtube '' and invariably he covered it guy taught me a lot along with folks like impulse docm and etho .
once i did that enough a bunch of let 's play videos began showing up in my feed along with hermitcraft and i kind of got hooked .
not just because of the technical builds but because of how they play and organize their bases .
i 've gone from being a complete incompetent noob to a pretty good player after watching folks like mumbo xisuma and a few others build their bases and taking notes along the way .
i watch those two guys regularly but planning on watching a few more tango false and welsknight for sure once i get caught up on older videos .
i truly honestly feel like women hate each other low-key .
i 've very rarely met super chill women who 'd meet me at some place run into me be in line at a party etc and just be smiling welcoming and sweet .
but the ones who do act open are so nice .
the kind you know you 're getting the real them .
so i think the gym thing is a reflection of a bigger problem personally .
guys do n't nearly beef as hard with other new guys not nearly as much .
and with their friends fights are n't really fights even .
they call themselves names and tell each other they 'll see them tomorrow .
i wish women in our western cultures were that way too .
they are so tainted by freedom group fuckery that even replicas of 150 year old designs manufactured by other companies are fucked
haha they do n't mean black people foo here black is meant as 'being in the vogue ' .
as in dude apparently pashmina is the new black ''
good guy head just wanted to make sure maxi could have a bat
hey but speaking of taxes and how the poorest among us are the highest consumers somehow what about that 1.6 trillion tax cut that the rich just leeched off of us working americans ?
yeah nuts to your immigration problem if they spend 14k more than they produce for us taxes only let 's forget that they re taking a job an american would n't take for their wages there 's no way they could ever leech as much as the rich just did .
i 'm afraid your cannon is pointing in the wrong direction bubb-o
look broski i 'll tell you what i told the other guy whataboutism is not a valid rhetorical technique .
none of my points are incorrect because trump and his republican cohorts passed a shitty tax bill .
have it randomly deal damage to all enemies instead ?
even when they 're right they often do n't use correct arguments .
bullshit was just a program for them to find the people to represent a position they disagree with that can be made to look like idiots .
thus they sought out living strawmen and made fun of them .
42 coin had a great rise today seems to have stabilised around 10btc but i think it might have another run up coming

when they are spamming you with auto combos it will eventually lead both players in the air so you can press forward light/medium/heavy .
only once their auto combo has finished and you are in the air alone to recover .

my fire warriors do not have any sept markings currently .
i personally went with a scheme of black armor and dark green clothes and bronze details .
this does n't fit any pre-made sept but that 's the wonderful thing about 40k the universe is so big that you can make your own planet without conflicting with the canon .
i usually buy a mix of them and stuff em with rice/meat
it really does feel like federer is struggling to handle this and cilic is again making all the plays .
sold my x80 and got the dx80 the former has zero throw
would agree personally but i read somewhere that legally not sure which country something is only gambling if you do n't have a guaranteed chance of getting something so video game companies have found that loophole where you are guaranteed an item be it nearly worthless 1/80 of what you pay or extremely valuable 4 what you pay with the majority of times getting something worth nearly nothing .
end of year will be not long after beta release .
i think if we do go to the moon it wo n't be till 2019 at the earliest .
comments are important to us and thank you for leaving one .
again we thank you for leaving a comment and look forward to responding .
hello i am a str enis myself the range and the way the spells work can be a hassle but honestly they arent really to bad esp 2 of your str spells do have a range that can be increase or decrease however summoning the vial cant go pass 1-5 there may be a class item to change it i am not 100 sure .
i am lvl 195 my vial got around 590hp i think it does go close to 1,000 right now running a 11ap set 1,100str 215 power 126 earth damage hitting somthing with 10 resist i do around 2,500 the issue i am having though is with the vial hp being only 590 for now 4ap summon vial cast furious than pernicious after that you actually kill you vial because you do over the 590 damage to it which saves you from using stim also summoning vial will do around 630 when it summons and pernicious word 470 furious 800 thats with the 10 resist already in to everything in 1 cell range of it expect summons the vial and blowing it up is 2 cell range .
also defensive word is also a good str attack the 20 erosion per use for 1 turn kinda bad but 38-40 base lowers a effect duration on a target by 1 and can be cast twice per turn and can hit the same target for 4ap each range of 1-4 cant be increase or decrease hopefully this helps you or give you ideas .
the main downside is healing teammates for a heal/power eni i would prob go str/intel or str/agi for a more team base play style str is more solo

i used to work at a service station and we had to padlock the toilet roll holder in our toilets closed because people would steal the ol ' 1-ply .
our key for the toilets was also attached to a big piece of perspex because we kept losing '' our toilet key .
the reason we even had a toilet key was because otherwise people would steal the soap toilet paper and hand towels .
the stereotype of british bad teeth is not that they are rotten but that they are not straight and not blindingly white .
we brush our teeth and actually have healthier teeth than americans fewer cavities more teeth .
that was the offensive bit that from what you wrote it sounds as though you believe our hygiene to be bad yet you have no knowledge or you would n't be asking .
is it true that british people have bad teeth ?
is the same true of other european countries ? ''
would have been a much simpler and less offensive way to put it .

girls are worse than boys at math in the same way that black kids are worse than white kids .
it 's technically true but it ignores a whole fuckton of factors that influence test results like poverty food instability educational resources social pressure encouragement role models etc .
another commonality between the two is that telling this kind of factoid to a child without context is a huge asshole thing to do .
will it make your kid want to strive harder ?
but it 's just as likely to teach them to be biased against others or internalize self-doubt about their abilities .
heck it could do both at once striving to defy stereotypes does n't mean you do n't also believe those stereotypes against yourself .
as a motivational tactic there are a lot of drawbacks and there are a lot of safer and more effective methods you could employ .
try to read up on stereotype threat '' with her it basically outlines exactly why her idea is bad .

i only have sold new items so far and i am not about to willingly have to deal with idiots who think i 'm fucking amazon graciously waiting to accept the items they did n't care enough to research or compare so i can take a loss reselling them used for a lower price .
i see people listing things they bought for rebates meaning they took off the upc as new '' instead of new other '' .
just mentioning it in the description does not cut it .

i 'm all down for a speed competition game of tag .
but i 'm still not a fan of the redbull and airwipp competitions because there are so many variables .
to me it 's like having a dancing competition where it would be difficult to judge ballet and hip-hop against each other .
but i 'm open for competition i just do n't think the right way to judge freestyle '' is there yet .
those are good suggestions what about a setting that ups the contrast between walls/other objects to make them stand out ?

i need help identifying the arp in this https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=os7djtfyrha beat or at least something like it .
after seeing what a great community this is and how its a great opportunity for alot of people to better understand crypto and mining i though i 'd make a little guide to mining with ccminer and how i get 455kh/s on one card https imgur.com/a/2nywi .
okay to begin what we need is to go download ccminer .
you 'll want to head over to the ccminer github https github.com/tpruvot/ccminer/releases and then for 32 bit users download the x86 version and for 64bit users download the x64 version .
next up extract the zip folder to your location of preference .
here is where we are gon na set up our pool location and address to mine to .
within the ccminer folder you 'll see a number of batch files starting with run-xxxx '' where xxxx is the coin .
i got lazy because for some reason notes wasnt letting me save a file as a .bat file so i just took the file for run-crea '' and duplicated it .
i then went and renamed the new file run-garlic '' however you can rename it whatever you want so long as you can identify which file you wan na start to mine what coin .
the standard guide suggests you use this as your .bat file however it can be quite inefficient .
if your card can support it i suggest adding lookup-gap=2
this tunes a compromise between ram usage and performance .
at a gap of 2 but increasing the gap can save you some gpu ram but almost
always at the cost of significant loss of hashrate .
this alone added an extra 100kh/s for me using a evga geforce gtx 1070 ftw .
your file should now look something like whats quoted above where pool has been replaced with the garlic bois pool address and the useraddress is replaced with my receiving address .
out of preference i use the evga overclock software however software like afterburner works just as well .
obviously these can be pushed further but so far ive found that at these settings my gpu sits at a chill 65c and i havnt had any crashes or speed stripes '' as i like to call em .
also a super important part of overclocking is setting a custom fan curve .
mysettings https imgur.com/a/7ucm2 can be found here once again .
i think compared to most people my fan speed is quite high however i 'm super paranoid about my card overheating .
thanks to this awesome community ive learn a bit more about mining and gpu setting and i 'm hoping everyone else can too !
if you see anything in my post and go well thats wrong what a bamboozle comment what it should say or if theirs additional settings to maximize performance and ill add/fix it and credit you .
i 'm relatively strong with composing the rest of an essay .
i have trouble finishing what i started and get horrible anxiety whenever it 's time to wrap things up .
anyone have any tips on writing strong effective conclusions ?
i 've never played a witcher game and got witch 3 goty on a whim last night .
before i play i wanted to ask seasoned players a question what do you know now about this game that you wish you knew before you started ?
any tips or advice or things to pay closer attention to ?
i 'd appreciate spoiler free answers but i 'm also well aware that this is the internet .
i want to go to sleep and not wake up on earth .
1 a good sam the eagle impersonator the read u/aurondarklord ggd comments aloud .
2 to pay a guy or team to continually reply to bitter in hopes it 'd eventually become too much for him .
it 's badly affecting my sleep to the point where i 'm not sleeping well at all even with sleep medicine and it 's fucked up that they schedule like that .
i barely made it through my last shift that it happened .
insomnia runs in the family so surely there is something that can be done here ?
getting off at 11 pm and then having just to wake up at 6 am to get ready for the next day is just a bit much for anyone really .

my 2014 s touchscreen failed in august took a month to replace and i got the car back in september .
when i got back from holiday travel in the first week of jan car had been sitting idle for 2 weeks but in my garage plugged in the touchscreen had died .
now less than three weeks later the touchscreen has failed yet again .
once they replace it that will be the fourth unit in a few months .
worth noting that both of the replacement units thus far have been refurbished units which could explain why they fail so quickly .
i 'm going to insist that tesla install a new unit this time because this is getting out of hand and it would be completely unacceptable for them to install yet another refurbished unit only for it to fail within a matter of weeks/months .
at this point i feel like i kind of deserve a complimentary upgrade to lte with a new unit ...
weird issue ... have n't been able to duplicate but want to run it by y'all .
i had my phone in airplane mode and i took pictures stock camera app .
they never showed in the preview box and never showed up in google photos but i did see them backing up to google photos i purposely watched the backup to see and saw the ticket move from 2 to 3 4 5 etc photos to back up '' .
this was 2 days ago they have n't shown up yet they 're just gone .
i have n't been able to check on a different device to see if they 're visible in google photos elsewhere .
a power cycle fixed the issue but definitely made me weary .
sometimes when i export an object it does this https imgur.com/qaz8ivx .
i can make a similar object in the same project and it does n't happen .
can someone help me out here i pre ordered the game and just picked it up today when i pre ordered the guy at gamestop said i get bonuses like armor so later i look it up and it says i get the origin armor for pre ordering i get the game start it up and its nowhere in my inventory .
i looked this up and i did speak to my housekeeper but all i got was commendation packs .

next game is at home on tuesday at 7:30pm est against the timberwolves .
i saw a match where shroud and the doc were discussing competitive play and the doc was expressing his wish to have set loot in competitive and some foreknowledge of the zone .
to me this is one of the main things that separates pubg from other games even within similar genres .
the element of luck is vastly overstated in my opinion as i rarely have a match where i do n't find an assault rifle of some sort or an ump or something useful .
i sympathize with their point but i feel like that would water down the experience and remove some of the novelty .
most competitive matches would likely revolve around the same parts of the map then and if the circle 's location was known ahead of time it would just encourage camping the center and such .
part of what makes pubg so fun is having to constantly adapt to changing circumstances being forced into an area you likely would n't have even been to but the zone forced you to it .
yes it would allow for competitive players/teams to preplan their games to a tee but that to me defeats the entire purpose of pubg .
the idea of turning this into an esport should n't change the nature of the game because the game 's very concept fits into the esport idea so naturally .
would some players be killed early trying to find loot ?
but this happens in pubg regularly and changing it for the competitive space just does n't make sense to me .
i understand that money is on the line and these players go through alot to get to these tournaments and i can imagine how defeating it would feel to be that guy killed first after doing that work .
i just do n't think that requires ripping out the framework of the game .
it would also make practicing in the actual game pointless because the competitive ruleset and loot spawns would be so different that practicing in a normal match would n't provide the same benefit to competitive players .
they may have to release a tournament playlist which would divide up the playerbase and i doubt it would just be pro players attempting to play it .
the very nature of having a ranked/casual set up would probably drive more people to the ranked playlist based on past experience in other games and how hard it is to find player matches v ranked matches .
i can see the other side and i want to have the discussion about this .
i sympathize with the doc 's concerns but i think it would defeat the purpose of the game itself to structure it down to that level .
maybe give the shoutcasters themselves foreknowledge of the circle or something like that some sort of tool that lets them view the game in a way to show that kind of thing .
but the players themselves that seems odd to me and i do n't know if i would enjoy watching the game as much if it was played this way .
i currently have rekkles in adc and hans sama in my flex while altec is a free agent .
while i want to believe in rekkles he has gotten mediocre points so far while altec and echo fox are popping off .
i recently accepted myself as trans and since then my dysphpria has gotten much worse .
i am very young only 13 and need advice on how to ease it .
things like buying new cloths or getting nails painted are out of the question for now because i am not out .
anything i can do that is not that suspicions ?
i live in a liberal area so i can be a bit flexible but not that much
i think ea should open up a one-week event open to the entire community where all of us get the same access to cards as the pros do in the tournaments .
reason how many unknown under-funded un-published or supported talents are out there ?
my theory is that there are several players out there that could legitimately compete with these pros if given the same resources .
think about it ... for one week you can make your actual ultimate team with any card ... then just play .
we take all the money out of it ... just for one week to see who truly is the best .

vibrating pile hammer is using its high frequency vibration to vibrate pile body with high acceleration to pass the vertical vibration of mechanical produce to pile which leading to changes in the soil structure around the pile strength decrease

i am addicted to the inflowing of the holy spirit .
i am addicted to the coming of the holy spirit .
i continue to allow the holy spirit to deposit god 's love in my heart .
leading me to want more and hunger for more .
this has been developing to chronic levels that i lost interest in schoolwork .
i know what immortality means that even if my body and mind are gone my heart would still be rendered indestructable because of this love and the hunger to possess more defining eternal life .
i ca n't help seeking more of the holy spirit 's love .
and so far i have missed one assignment because of this .
this love is everywhere this holy spirit everywhere so accessible i am already addicted severely .
i am so young yet it is true this love the holy spirit is like opium .
something that seems insignificant yet will develop over time given one earnestly seeks for it .
and so i will tell you about this love .
young man students please if you want to do well in school just know that this is very addictive .
and when you know that such love is addictive you will have to admit that you are an addict of the holy spirit .
five years or maybe shorter depends on how earnest your prayers may be .
my girlfriend plans on moving into my apartment with me and she recently filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy .
the process is n't over with yet but is expected to be soon .
i 'm trying to figure out how likely it is that her application to be added to my lease be denied .
i have a 750 credit score and sufficient income for the both of us .
the apartment application asks if you 've declared so she is planning on putting yes as it shows up on her credit report .
i 'm pretty sure her credit score is going to plummet as soon as it 's finalized .
so as to not be obvious that i have someone living with me that 's not on the lease by having her be denied i am thinking about just not attempting .
and having her live with me without notifying the complex .
it 's a big complex in austin texas so i think we should n't have an issue getting away with it .
hey guys just looking for some help with the extreme reactors turbines in the forever stranded pack we have a reactor working fine but we ca n't seem to connect any pipes/conduits/ducts to the turbine for the water/steam i think i 've never used turbines before my brother is the one in charge of building it lol .
we 've watched tutorials and mod spotlights but the pipes used are either not in the pack or just wo n't connect .
i do n't know if we 're supposed to use any specific pipes or if it 's just not an option in this pack ... .. any help would be great !
i 've always been scared that while i am with someone driving on a bridge that it is going to collapse .
i 've been afraid of this ever since i can remember so i just want to know if it can happen

when i was nineteen 12 years ago my primary physician gave me my first pelvic exam .
it was the most painful thing i 'd ever experienced to the point where i felt like i was going to throw up and i begged her to halt the procedure but she just told me i would be fine and continued .
i nearly passed out right there on the table .
i 'm okay to do regular checkups but even the mention of a physically invasive exam can send me into a full blown panic attack .
i have to get sedated with nitrous oxide to have most dentistry done sometimes even for cleanings depending on how stable i am that day .
the last doctor i saw was flippant when i mentioned my panic attacks and said that she 'd like to do a pelvic exam at my next appointment and i proceeded to nearly have a meltdown in the exam room just thinking about it .
i obviously did n't go to the next appointment .
i 'm on multiple medications for depression and anxiety both conditions are mostly stable outside of the doctor situation and right now i just see a local doctor who 's willing to prescribe my refills and send me on my way .
the thing is i show a lot of the symptoms of endometriosis and i know that 's not something i should ignore .
the problem is even with my insurance i ca n't afford to see a psychiatrist to work on this .
and the few doctors i 've forced myself to go to were flippant dismissive or downright condescending about my anxieties even when i was in tears and hyperventilating right in front of them .
even when i would call ahead and have the staff note on my chart that i was prone to panic attacks in medical situations .
i ca n't just keep making appointments with random doctors hoping this one will be the one to understand that i ca n't just 'get over ' this .
it takes too long to get in to see them as a new patient and every time i go it just makes my anxiety worse .
i feel like i 'm wasting everyone 's time .
i just do n't know what to do and i did n't know where else to ask .
i just want a doctor i can trust not one that thinks i 'm a pitiful wreck .
my 23/f girlfriend 's sister had baby on my birthday last year and it completely over shadowed my birthday .
i ended up spending the day in a small town in idaho where her sister lives alone drinking at a bar at noon and then sleeping in my car until everyone came back from the hospital as we were staying with her sister and i did n't feel right being at her house alone .
now the baby 's birthday is coming up again and my girlfriend is planning to spend the day with her nephew and family only this time they are coming to portland where we live .
honestly i am really upset about it even though i have not mentioned anything to her .
i mean the kid is 1 and it is her nephew .

i have some questions about mental illness mainly bpd but i ca n't setup an appointment to talk to a therapist irl and ask these questions .
so i was just wondering are there any professionals here who would be willing to answer a few questions ?
anyone know where i can find a aftermarket single vesa mount stand for 20lb 32 '' monitor ?
preferably something heavy that does n't stick out in the back .
hypothetical situation my cost of tuition is 10k and my financial aid package consists of 10k in federal grants and i get a 5k academic excellence scholarship .
the federal grants will be used first so the 10k of tuition is covered but will i get the check for 5k academic excellence scholarship money to use on books laptop and other expenses ?
i have been working on ear training and i am currently struggling with triad inversions in open positions .
i think a large part of the difficulty is that interval order and the distance between the root and top note are not as strong of cues as they are in closed position triads .
i realize the answer will be lot of practice '' but i am hoping to get advice on where to put my focus .
my small league me and my kid are close to defeating braniac .
he has 48k health left in phase 4 and we 're out of attacks with 20 hours remaining .
i 'm interested in learning more about the discourses and general structures of male and female from the lacanian point of view .
i 've read finks the lacanian subject and it was really great but i 'm looking for more detail case studies more embodied examples dreams etc .
right now i have questions on ‘negative ' forms of the discourses i.e .
can the hysteric discourse demand the real too much ?
there are hints at this in thoery but its never directly said in finks book .
in general i 'm a big jungian personally but i really respect a lot of lacans ideas .
i think lacans idea 's and jung/post jungians can really flesh each other out as it is clear to me there are many common grounds at the end of the day though the theories seem so different .
in short if your interested jungs work can be too simple and imagistic while lacan strikes me as sometimes too intellectual and in turn disembodied .
all this in mind i 'm surprised there is so little dialogue .
the types attracted to jung vs lacan seem to me to be very different and this is probably at the heart of the percieved silence .
both seem to sneer at each other which is too bad .
excuse my possible niavety in regards to lacan thanks .
be as specific as possible and include specific games or programs you will be using .
gaming rainbow six siege and fortnite mostly and streaming .
note beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy .
what exactly do you need included in the budget ?
which country and state/province will you be purchasing the parts in ?
if you 're in us do you have access to a microcenter location ?
texas microcenter is a few hours away i 'd prefer not to drive out there but will if i have too .
if reusing any parts including monitor s keyboard/mouse/etc what parts will you be reusing ?
if yes are you interested in overclocking right away or down the line ?
are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build ?
ex ssd large amount of storage or a raid setup cuda or opencl support etc
1tb hdd for sure and a 120gb ssd for a boot drive if you can squeeze it into the budget
do you have any specific case preferences size like itx/microatx/mid-tower/full-tower styles colors window or not led lighting etc or a particular color theme preference for the components ?
atx mid tower black/white theme with some red accents maybe like the ram or something would love a side window on the case .
do you need a copy of windows included in the budget ?
if you do need one included do you have a preference ?
in light of recent incidents and the harder line delta has chosen to take regarding animals traveling on board .
do the rest of you flight attendants feel this program has been almost laughably abused ?
there is certainly a need here for disabled passengers .
obviously seeing eye dogs get a pass and some others that are harder to spot .
dogs that can detect and warn of an oncoming seizure for example or maybe some that help with ptsd .
unfortunately i have seen far too many bringing large and clearly not emotionally supportive animals on the aircraft .
i feel this puts an unnecessary strain on other passengers comfort in an environment that is already uncomfortable by nature .
those that choose to follow the rules pay for their pet get a carrier keep the pet in the carrier for the duration of the flight end up looking like chumps next to those that flagrantly abuse this system and save money doing it .
i think a couple things could be done to mitigate this issue .
make an emotional support animal have to be of a handful of select breeds .
if you need a support animal it must be one of these choice few and possibly come from a select group of licensed breeders .
not my idea but a fellow fa mentioned requiring insurance for the animal to travel .
that way if the animal were to attack the airlines responsibility would be waived and the victims recourse would be through the owner .
my ideas certainly are n't perfect so i 'm interested in hearing others views and ideas on this topic .
maybe many of you are n't bothered by the influx of pets onboard and i stand in the minority .
i 'd like to play this with another girl .
i do n't mind if that 's actually another girl or a guy playing as a girl .
but if there 's any guys that really want their asshole wrecked send me a message .
also i 'm going to be online for a while and i doubt i 'll be flooded with messages so feel free to send me a message whenever you see this even if you 're late .
i want to do a roleplay/chat about extreme insertions far bigger than anything actually possible .
i 'm open to almost any scenario or characters celebs pornstars or just two bored girls .
but whatever we do i 'd like both girls getting stretched not only my character .
as well as huge insertions i love public play watersports object birthing embarrassment sounding ageplay and prolapse but not all of those are required .
no limits but i 'd prefer to stay away from bdsm meaning no punishments or tying anyone down and i 'd prefer to be more creative than just a really big cock .
i have plenty of ideas myself and we can use any ideas you can come up with .
some scenarios to pick from or we can make our own include two celebs and obsessed with stretching and ca n't stop themselves from doing it even when they 're on set .
or two pornstars we 'll known for being given able to take a fist like it 's nothing have to go much further to maintain their popularity .
or two or bored college girls with little to no inhibitions and an entire afternoon to kill .
or a camgirl that will do anything at all for a few extra tips .
those are just a couple of ideas i came up with i 'm sure we can think of something better together .
for your best chance of getting a reply give me a scene that you 're interested in playing .
i do n't mind if you take one of the ideas above as long as you flesh it out to more than just a short sentence .
tommorow it 's the first day of my internship .
however i 'm really scared for the new people .
where am i going to sit what am i going to say do i have to sit alone ?
the past 3 years of my life have been completely terrible .
everything i do has no significance and for the past few months ive had extremely gruesome and strong urges to take my life .
i no longer enjoy anything yet i know i cant die because my family would be devastated .
ive never spoken to my mom about suicidal urges however she always brushes off anything i really need help with ex .
often people recommend therapy anti depressants or the national suicide prevention hotline but none are an option for me .
although i constantly want to die a small part of me fights these urges .
if you have any time in your day i would really appreciate some advice .
sorry for the poor writing tried to keep it short as possible thoughts are scrambled and im new to reddit .
i 'm sure there 's a few of you out there that
have known about nofap for a while but ca n't seem to string decent streaks together .
this comes down to a variety of factors i know but i 've found that if i do n't count edging as a 'fail ' then i 'm more likely to screw up my main goal of no o .
i had a streak back in october 2017 that went for 27 days and one since the start of the year that i ended last night rip .
the 2017 one i was constantly edging for the entirety of the streak but told myself it was ok because i was n't looking at porn and was n't o'ing .
however i felt little to know superpowers '' within this amount of time and also eventually failed the streak around the end of november .
jump to my most current streak and i did not edge at all and had noticeable change in 'power ' level until a week before i lost the streak .
i spent a good amount of time edging that night but ended up avoiding release out of willpower and eventual use of the panic button .
again after a week of no edging or anything my urges came back stronger than ever and eventually led to my reset in 2018 .
i think this could mean that even edging is messing with testosterone levels in your blood .
probably at a lesser scale but still an effect .
that 's why i saw the peak urge again at 7 days as of it was week 1 again .
i know the edging wreaked havoc on my dopamine again but that 's not quite what i 'm referring to .
i think my point here is that i can no longer attempt streaks where edging is n't considered a fail .
it stunts the resetting process and will keep your superpowers at bay as well as leave you in a position to play with fire .
i learned to do that in the beginning as a way to wean myself off but never turned away from it .
i hope you guys will join me in cutting edging out completely as well if you have n't already .
today went well after yesterday 's mishap and i did not binge .
hoping to get that streak even longer this time !
we have one inexperienced player but two of us have experience with 5e and roll 20 .
send me a pm if this sounds right for you .

my bank accout has not been verified after 15 working days !
i cant sell my crptos to lock in my profits. ?
i sent a small amount from my bank account which was accepted by the coinbase team/bank..
hello just as the title says i just wanted to share with you all .
ever since i 'd try to make an effort on cutting back from everyday to 2-3 times a week .
i found success but it 's a vicious cycle .
i think i 've only gone 5-6 days at most without fapping .
i think i am destroying myself without realizing it .
also i do n't know if this should belong in r/tooafraidtoask but i have experienced hair thinning since high school i 'm 23 now and i was wondering if fapping too much may be a possible cause .
i feel like i am masturbating all of my nutrients away .
i 'm hoping to go on this journey and gain something from it like the other redditors i have seen posted !
everytime i try to play audio back from ableton the audio sounds weird .
the track kind of sounds like its been drowned in reverb and lead lines in tracks ca n't be heard they 're really soft .
what 's weird is that when i export the track to wav the audio plays back just fine .
i 've tried increasing my audio buffer size deselcting the warp button and reducing my cpu load as much as possible .
can anyone give me suggestions as to what may be the problem .
the audio i 'm trying to playback is pre-recorded .
i use an usb 3.0 3.5 '' 8tb drive to backup my data every monday .
the drive is always plugged in the back usb 3.0 port .
i use a sockel with a clock so its only on every monday between 1am and 4am .
what it should do sockel turns on drive at 0:50am backup job starts at 1am it unmounts the drive the sockel turns off at 4am the drive stops spinning .
the problem very often the drive does n't connect the second time .
no matter if i unplug the usb turn off/on the drive it doesnt connect .
i have to reboot the nas while the drive is connected .
if i reboot and the drive is n't connected it also does n't connect after the reboot .
it works sometimes for 2-3 weeks but at one time it stops connecting .
not sure if there 's a fix for this but for some reason my thaumcraft harvest golems seem to just kill my agricraft crops at night .
they break the crop sticks instead of just harvesting the crops .
i thought it might be a light issue but i surrounded the crops with torches and the behavior persisted .
read about sophie scholl '' on wikipedia you 'll see the person she was and why i finally decided on the name sophie .
i hope sophie scholl 's life will be a source of strength for me .
i 'm pre-everything but i have lived many years wearing female clothing without any breast forms fishnet or regular pantyhose mini skirts dresses .
my style was punk/gothic/rebel so my look was mostly accepted in public .
i was in my mind just a man who liked to dress however i wanted .
using another username i 've been reading lots of your posts for the last few weeks .
last week i made the first steps find a doctor and book an appointment to get hrt
lucky for me informed consent is available in quebec canada and the cost of hrt pills should be under 50 a month .
and also last week i decided to live as a woman with my new diy foam breasts and skirts and dresses and high heels and makeup and ... you get the idea i 'm sure .
now that i 've introduced myself i will be less shy in the mtf subreddit and i will try to participate when/where i can contribute something .
please pardon me in advance if i ever make a mistake or if i inadvertently sound too negative or judgemental .
edit 2 added a link to my sophie '' image in order to stop reddit from showing the picture from the wikipedia link
would like to visit xinjiang/urumqi via either of these two cities but the high speed rail is n't ready yet .
the slow train takes 40 hours and flights are really expensive .
does anyone have any experience getting to urumqi from sichuan ?
im thinking high speed rail to lanzhou and then from lanzhou to urumqi .
but this will probably end up being a bit pricey too .
need info on traveling to revelstoke for the first time ?
for new and experienced snowboarders with any questions at all about snowboarding including gear learning what to wear where to go what terminplogy is rad etc .
please ask questions in this thread and let the r/snowboarding community help out .
this is meant as a judgement-free and welcoming environment for noobs to ask any kind of question related to snowboarding no matter how dumb it may seem .
so i had this idea for a fun list to bring to wednesday games how do you think it will fare ?
harpoon instead of cruise but then i 'd need to demote something like the arc to a linked battery b-wing or a y-wing tlt

feared i had lost a little over 3 ltc but then i came across devbitcoin .
he responded quickly send a complete guide on how to recover the ltc and even offered to recover them for me if i requested .
after spending hours on looking for my transaction in the cryptoforest of transactions i gave up and requested help from devbitcoin .
he required an ltc address to send the litecoin to and the original seed words .
must say i hesitated a second to send my seed words to a complete stranger that i just have had a brief correspondence with on reddit .
nevertheless i had done as written in his comprehensive guide transferred my other coins to a temporary wallet and done a reset of my nano s with a new seed .
amazingly in under an hour he recovered all the lost ltc .
transferred them to my ltc address minus the tip that i offered for his great help .
your go to guy if you ever lose your ltc .

i am using my hd60 to stream mario odyssey .
runs into my computer monitor that has no speakers .
switch so i can hear the sound of the game but when i do that the sound does n't come into
is there a fix for this or do you need to plug the elgato into something with pre-installed
last time i played the game was around 1.1 or 1.2
its still the same game but a lot as changed under the surface .
division is now my go to mmo since i can play incursions missions dark zone or underground either alone or with other people .
with the current ge holy shit ge 's are glorious !
i really want too complete my firecrest and i am lucky out of 12 boxes i got 5 pieces .
when the ge ends am i somehow able to farm the missing piece ?
am i understanding correctly that named bosses in dz and ug can drop classifieds ?
also is there some sort of gurantee that the new classifieds are added to the loot pool ?
where would be my best go to for information regarding a potential 1.9 or year 3 roadmap ?
it 's actually coffee flavoured jelly beans give it a taste .
the poke meter was a pedometer for earlier pokémon games on the ds that would store up points from walking you could use to buy items and do things with your pokémon .
it would also give experience to one pokémon while you walked so long as you transfer it back when you 're done .
that sounds like a tough situation that you 're in .
fyi you do n't need to provide a prescription to buy medication from qhi .
when a reason to get fired is less questionable than a reason to get promoted .
the dm has to create some kind of incentive for the players to stick together .
our d m had to work with a psion who wants to find and bring back a fellow alumni of the school of unmatched excellence a goliath warden who is looking for his tribe that he lost a tiefling who is looking for the orc who murdered his family and me a jolly bard who wants to adventure !
all of the trails are somehow connected to the main plot which was excellently done by our dm .
for example the alumni went mad and was captured by a pirate lord .
the pirate lord was willing to let us speak to the captured alumni if we helped him with a task .
that task was to help get rid of a situation in some farmlands to the west .
coincidentally the orc that the tiefling was looking for was last seen in those farmlands .
and the goliath 's tribe was probably charmed by a hooded female wizard who is a higher up of this orc .
long story short try to connect all of the stories in a coherent way .
this is the dm 's responsibility mostly although the pc 's also have to have some leeway .
hey can you link me to your faceit profile please
should the comma be in columns a and b at the end of the text ?
the same would hold true if you bought the washing machine in cash .
also why i would never buy a washing machine in cash .
i have i still did n't feel like it was doing anything .
i can only assume that the pain i 'm experiencing at the time would be worse without them but i 've never felt like they give me any kind of relief .
compare that with something like codeine where i have absolutely felt noticeable relief .
little canary canarinho for brazil and the red fury la furia roja for spain are pretty cool .
lots of national teams have cool nicknames cameroon are the indomitable lions ghana are the black stars nigeria are the super eagles côte d'ivoire are the elephants netherlands are the clockwork orange .
i am strongly in favour of all police being routinely armed it is the only sensible solution .
you might be but they 're strongly against it .
i just now put together that adorable '' means something that is adored .
in my mind it was always just a synonym for cute .
as you can see ive already gotten the gaactic clusters and ascended but it hasnt given me the achievment for it .

barbecue chili absolutely does not give you the same reward that decisive strike does .
all it does is tell you which direction to go after hooking someone it 's designed to pull you away from hooks and give you bonus bloodpoints .
after that 4 seconds survivors can still hide and elude the killers especially since urban evasion is a thing .
survivors nowadays expect killers to be running barbecue chili .
i ca n't say the same for decisive strike ... unless you dribble to hooks which is n't always possible and you can leave yourself open to bodyblocks and flashlight blinds .

pretty sure the architect stated he was the inevitable result of the equation that built the matrix .
but there is a deeper story about how god the architect '' did n't really create the garden .
the snake is a far more central figure in world religions .
the male god of the jewish/christian/islamic traditions is a visitor .
we have sumerian seals from as early as 3500 b.c .
showing the serpent and the tree and the goddess with the goddess giving the fruit of life to a visiting male . ''
in other words the matrix is making a point that the architect is more of an observer visitor to the situation .
the choice is really with neo and as the oracle says the architect ca n't see past choices .

further to my in-jest comment below i do actually have a serious question .
happy to take advice on this would offline storage be a better idea ?
actually no i never withdrew that much at once .
before this january my largest sepa withdrawals were under 10.000 dollars .
this is the first time i withdrew 5 figures almost 30.000 dollars .
this is also the first time i encountered any delays .

so again i 'm looking to the community with so much more experience with this gear than me to ask which focal length the 35mm or the 23mm would be the best first and for a while only prime lens for someone mainly shooting street photography in the city but who also wants a jack of all trades .
i have used my 35mm f2 for street photography but i find it much less useful than the 18mm-55mm f2.8 for architecture/street photography .
i have taken some great portraits with the 35mm f2 though .

people cant be held accountable for their vote because they do n't know how the election will turn out ?
that 's not at all what the argument is or what i 'm saying .
you 're trying to lay blame on bernie supporters character in general for defecting '' from the hillary dems .
i 'm saying this is hypocritical because hillary dems literally defected at least twice as much in the previous run for a new dem candidate .
6-12 of bernie supporters voted trump while 24 of hillary voters went to mccain .
the election results do not rely solely on bernie voters so trying to isolate and blame these numbers is erroneous .
it does n't matter the results in this argument because the voter 's character '' and motives are decided upon voting not upon the results .
i 'm not defending the people who went from sanders to trump it 's unlikely these people were even democrats/leftists to begin with i 'm saying it 's just a bad angle to try and argue that these people literally are the reason why trump won .
it 's a bad argument to try and cause some guilt by association with these defectors and impose it upon bernie supporters in general .
i 've never actually seen any version with 2018 other than this one .

i know you think you 're really rustling jimmies or whatever you kids say these days but it really is n't that big a deal .
most people did n't claim it would never hit 9s .
they claimed that regular drivers would n't replicate dodge 's time .
some days you 're at the strip and everything goes right .
it 's the first run if the first run if the day and the strip has just been refinished and the surface is still slightly warm from the day before but the air is nice and cool and you just hook up and bail every shift and for one brief moment the world is perfect .
but most other runs are n't going to come close .
and iirc this time is pretty much on par with what dodge said you could get totally stock ?
so someone on race gas in full drag trim got the time dodge advertises as being doable on a perfectly stock demon .

if he does n't have that he ca n't actually multiclass into cleric .
if a good character is wanting to suddenly worship an evil god while it 's not technically against the rules more importantly it creates a very odd roleplaying scenario .
also it 's up to you to decide how powerful demigods are .
you might decide that kurtualyek is n't even powerful enough to grant divine spells to begin with .
also kurtualyek may very well reject this player though probably not since the player is a dragonborn .
i mean part of me does n't want to quench the guy 's dreams but it 's highly likely that if he multiclasses into cleric all it 's really going to do is just make his character really bad .
unless you build a rogue/cleric very carefully you do n't have two classes that are a whole lot less compatible .
there are lots of ways to be an exemplar of a given deity without becoming a cleric .
hell becoming a paladin is quite a bit more compatible so long as the ability scores are there to do so .
it 's obvious trump told murray and other mine owners to do as you please and the government wo n't bother you .
do you think they reopened the mines just because trump said yea coal ?
for starters he gave them permission to dump their waste in local streams .
i loved this book but it was one of the few where the movie was better .
in the book there was a few chapters that were from the misery books the character was writing which if you have n't seen the movie are kinda romance fantasy novels and they were soooooooo boring .
i wanted to skip them but was worried i may miss something important .
if you ever do read it skip the misery '' chapters
damn that reminds me i need to change my w2 withholding tomorrow .

i do n't really think it 's fair to hate on a team because of their fans .
do n't get me wrong there are some really annoying tsm fans but there are also really annoying cloud 9 fans and annoying clg fans and annoying liquid fans .
tsm is just the most popular team so they stick out unfortunately .
i guess what i said came off harsher than i meant .
i was trying to say that it could have been the aesthetician 's fault as they could have missed a point of contamination on the sterile packaging or something along those lines or the client did n't take proper care of her open wounds which is what they briefly are no matter how small .
even if she had gone back to the aesthetician they probably would have had to send her to the doctor anyway .
everyone reacts differently so i guess the reaction could have been pretty acute rather than coming on slowly .
for some reason i thought they did free shipping .
also the last few times i checked i could n't find the pros in lime green or red .
that 's a really good idea hold on i 'll do it
you can buy those keys straight from china and stick them on any mechanical keyboard .
can i ask why you 're afraid to tell her no ? ''
in my opinion there 's a couple of potential reasons .
i hope it 's because she has made things awkward in the past when people try to establish boundaries with her .
i fear that you have some lurking concerns for your physical or emotional safety if her whims are thwarted .
obviously the way that we might suggest you deal with her is going to be moderated depending upon where on that spectrum she exists in your mind .
i come from the 90 's gamer identity and i feel personally attacked by people like anita sarkeesian .
it is not harmless social critique to people like me .
it is an attack to the very core of my character as a human being and an assault on a past time that i have dedicated countless hours and unknown amounts of money on .

see comments below yours it 's much less strange for outsiders .
women never give blue balls to men men do it to themselves when they expect sex .
he expected to have sex with you but when he found out you did n't want that he put the blame on you .
you are not responsible for anyone 's sexual satisfaction and therefore it is impossible for you to give someone blue balls .
the guy clearly felt entitled to your body so when he could n't have sex he figured he would masturbate instead .
remember however that if he masturbated in front of you when you clearly said no '' twice that is sexual harassment .
by now she must have gone through every name there ever was and none fit were perfect enough for her perfect girl .

i put most of the blame on jj for the mystery box shit .
however rian still gets some blame for not taking that and giving some satisfying conclusions .
i 'm excited for rian 's trilogy cause he 'll have free reign instead of being stuck with the middle movie aka the most important movie of the trilogy .
also i do n't get why rian would have the movie end with the rebels fighting the big bad empire .
considering they told him to go wherever he wanted i was hoping he 'd reverse the tables and build up the resistance as an equal force to the first order rather than have them be pushed back down to a small group .
he did great at subverting some expectations but overall i felt he left us back with rebels vs empire light side vs dark side again .

a lot of people have some memories from their teenage years that they 're not fond of .
with raging hormones and not much to do with their time teenagers really can be awfully cruel .
people were bullied they were laughed at considered unpopular were victims of gossip felt out of place and insecure and felt constantly judged .
adults still do that stuff as well but teenagers are n't even subtle about it and you often ca n't do much to avoid them .
the cruelty takes on a new level and your hormones make it hurt far more again .
so teenagers horrible for some people in some sense .
touch controls on switch are very intuitive and comfortable .
i don´t own a procontroller but i learned to play on joycons fairly fast altough it´s bit clumsy .

i always snicker when wives move back with their parents for deployments and tours .
if you have to move back home-you 're just playing house .
i also laugh out loud when people have to take extra time off to get their lazy lard wives back home .
it 's no coincidence most of the women who run back to their parents are fat .
one guy i use to work with has a 21 year hippo wife .
i mean this girl was easy 300lbs and he was like 170 .
300 pound whale had a 1 year old and guess where he had to take hungry hippo before his deployment ?
back to her mother 's house because hungry hippo ca n't function on her own .
she needs someone feeding her and she ca n't stay in bed when she has to be the sole one taking care of mini hippo .
so they still going to attempt with bombardier looking at how new york banned them from bidding in that new 500+car order .

some times i really want to play the game and other times i just wan na build things .
without spoiling too much there is a bit of land and it is definitely part of the story line .
i think it is more about me not knowing how to handle it .
i am sure she did this to other peopke who gave her a mean threatening look so she stopped .
she always did it to me when i was on the phone knowing i would not interrupt a call .
like i ate some extra spicy food last night that did n't sit well and i feel like the cashier knows '' kind of bad .

i 'm talking about the time period leading up to that .
instead of having two x-wing series going one focused on wedge directly following the aftermath of the war and one following poe before and after the st they are just doing one .
so instead of seeing wedge get to lead a squadron and go on missions during the ot and after it we are only going to get stories about poe during and after the st .
the other entries in the series were limited to doa nintendo consoles ...
the 'problem ' with that idea is that turbine/ssg have altered some portions of lotro to use 64 bits but not everything .
so it 's not necessarily your change of computer systems that has prevented crashes .
i 'm a student so i selectively build my class schedule so i 'm walking across campus for every class .

if we 're being honest it 's matthews or eichel until further notice .
but that 's assuming you mean mcdavid 's age or younger .
mackinnon or barkov can easily make a contention for the 2nd best aswell .
we could add in laine but i do n't believe he 's above any of the 5 players mentioned above .
nylander and marner can probably fill out somewhere in the 6-10 range also .
if you want to stretch it we can throw in boeser and barzal and but sample size is a factor for them .
you should probably look up the definition of troll .

in the end the important thing is that you have options .
if you 're not feeling the itch to quit right now you do n't have to but it 's a nice option to have in your back pocket ready when you are .

i 'm a man and have sexual sins in my past as well .
i 've been rejected by some catholic women before due to this .
it sucks but it 's completely understandable from the other person 's perspective .
remember that through confession our sins may be forgiven but it does n't remove the physical consequences of sin .
however remember that not everyone is going to reject you for this .
there are many men like me who have our own pasts and i 'm sure there are plenty of virgin catholic men who would n't reject you for it either .
do n't be discouraged if some people reject you .
you ca n't change what happened in the past .

i 'm a bit confused on your suggested passive when one grievance you mention is that you do n't interact with enemies that often .
if you were to attack enemies or interact directly with them via damage the passive would be useless .
so unless her kit is entirely indirect concerning any damage dealt the passive would n't work very often .
the current passive makes sense as part of her mind control not allowing enemies to think correctly though i understand how it can occasionally be counter-intuitive .
though i feel that it clashes less than your suggested passive .
but i encourage you to find something a bit different and i understand your frustration with her feeling ineffective with direct combat .
i 'm afraid of a million dollars in that case lol .

opposing players in my youth baseball league would taunt me for standing in the wrong '' batters box and opposing pitchers and coaches would accuse me of cheating because i was literally the only lefty player in the entire 8-team league and all my coaches were righties as well so i never quite learned how to throw with speed or accuracy .

no captains need the beast slayer skill to insta kill caragors when you execute with them and they knock you off as well .
beast proof captains will either counter the execution or just go through the animation and not take damage ca n't remember how it works exactly .
normal captains will still bat the caragor away during the animation take damage themselves and do n't actually deal damage to the caragor .
however if a caragor attempts to pounce on a normal captain without you riding it the captain will take very slight damage and slash at the caragor dealing an amount of damage usually enough to kill it at high levels

they 're just taking so long to tell us because they do n't want to shit the bed by revealing that too early before they 've fully had the chance to prepare their pr spin .
as it is there 'll be people here who 'll say they 're more than willing to buy the same game again and pay the full sub so half blizzard 's battle is already won .

i fucked things up so hi i 'm here instead of getting laid .
boosting aggregate demand is good for the economy is a fallacy stemming from keynesianism .
it basically states that as long as people are spending the economy should get back on track but does n't take into account what they 're spending on .
therefore it is a keynesian idea that destroying things is good for the economy because it requires people to spend more than they otherwise would have on repairing damage even though obviously that society is left worse off .
if you 're saying you do n't think keynesians think that which i think you might be i 'll link a funny article from one of the most high profile keynesians there is paul krugman .

does n't make sense to me that they 're blowing it up at this point when they could still compete for a spot in the playoffs .
as it stands i typically have to go through 4 rounds of sequel trilogy maps before i get to play anything from the original trilogy or clone wars .
four rounds of what are arguably the worst sa maps in the game four rounds where i do n't to fly bombers and at least two rounds where my only 2 ship choices look exactly alike .
if and when starfighter assault is finally added to arcade i will be able to decide what map i want to play .
if i want to play a clone wars map as the republic or if i 'm in the mood to play an original trilogy map as the empire or what have you all i would have to do go into arcade pick the map configure the settings to my personal preferences expert ai double player health fast ability recharge ai respawn set to extreme switch to the faction i want to play and then just play it .
such a simple concept ... it seems we all took it for granted .
also is it just me or does starfighter assault have fewer players than any other game mode lately ?
all day long it 's been taking longer for me to find matches and the last game i played there were only 4 people on each team .
that 's sad because starfighter assault is hands-down the best game mode in battlefront ii right now and shows the most significant improvement over the previous game in terms of both gameplay and level design imo .

as the title says it 's something i 've been aware of since alpha but surprisingly never seen posted .
you can swap who leads the song on a shanty .
who ever begins the song is automatically the lead instrument all others who join in are now back-ups more or less .
to swap lead the leader has to briefly stop using their instrument to pass the lead to someone else .
it 's really fun to play around with since both the instruments sound differently when leading or back-up try it out next time you 're having a shanty down .
when you hear him talking to boogey or bout that channel with the wife and husband building a house you really realize he is n't the same person anymore .

and then in the last year my stepdad tried to kill my mom my dad died my mother in law died and i 've recently lost 2 pets .
i noticed the other day when i was looking online that i lost an hour somewhere ... and started thinking about it and have realized i never feel present in my body and i do n't know if i am really able to any more .
i have felt brief periods where i did not feel like i was dissociating but they are unpleasant so i go back to this .
i am not sure of what the benefits to no longer dissociating are or if this is something i should even bother trying to fix at this point .
it 's sort of just how i live now .
i have been clinically diagnosed with ptsd bpd bipolar 1 social anxiety and general anxiety disorder .
i have gone through trauma therapy dbt and cbt but dissociation is something we never really talked about .
i do n't really know what if anything can be done about this .
mostly looking for other people 's experiences with handling similar stuff and whether or not it has been beneficial fixing this .
or if this is just how my brain copes with reality now forever because not dissociating is too painful .
i 'm not a danger to myself or anything .
i am just not really ever completely present any more .

phoenix on thursday january 25 2018 several armed trump supporters carrying trump flags surrounded arizona state representative pamela hannley and yelled at her about her quot protecting illegals quot near the state capitol in phoenix .
quot rep. descheenie stepped in between them and rep. hannley in order to protect her from them .
as soon as he did so it drew the attention of the rest of the trump protesters .
the rest of the trump protestors quickly walked over to us surrounding us and aggressively yelling at us about our support for 039 illegals. 039 quot .
i quickly walked back into the house of representatives building to call for a security escort .
a security guard came out of the building and proceeded to escort us to the farmer 039 s market next to the building .
the trump protestors followed behind the security guard and continued to yell at us until the security guard blocked their entrance into the farmer 039 s market .
benally says the trump supporters were at the capitol on thursday intimidating and verbally assaulting not only dark-skinned lawmakers and staffers but young school children who were there to meet with their legislative representatives .

direct links for details about the eclipse for each city
if you do n't know how to interpret the direction '' and altitude '' numbers that are in those links then read this article https www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/horizontal-coordinate-system.html
the next total lunar eclipse over australia will be on the morning of july 28th at about 6-7am so tonight 's one is a prime opportunity for the people that are n't early birds .
the next one which will be at a good '' time of night after this will be on the 26th of may 2021 which will happen at 9pm eastern states time .
i have only ever had one and i sold it by accident dammit but i did n't particularly like how it looked anyway .
which ones do you guys recommend i look out for and how may i get them ?
right now i use either remission or the medjay shield
so i finally exhausted all options trying to get my insurance to cover my current doctor .
even the company i work for who pays for the insurance stepped in but they got told the same thing over and over .
in short it seems the issue is specific to colorado 's hmox plan .
so instead of butting heads with the insurance i 'm working with a liaison and we found so far a single lgbt doctor with trans patient experience that my insurance is guaranteed to cover .
i know nothing about it other than it 's a subscription based doctor .
does anyone have any experience with a mdvip and trans healthcare ?
or can anyone at least tell me if mdvip 's are reliable ?
just not sure how i feel about a subscription based doctor to be honest .
tl dr my insurance sucks and i need to know if mdvip doctors are reliable for healthcare .
they want 1600 annually from my pocket not covered by insurance plans to even see the doctor .
i 'm not paying to see the doctor then paying every time i visit the doctor .

port forwarding does work for everything except for a router used as an access point that 's got its lan address set on itself statically within the same subnet 10.0.0.2 but outside the dhcp range of the actual router 10.0.0.10-10.0.0.255 .
the ap '' router 10.0.0.2 is accessible fron within lan .

i think we all know fogged out vapes by now .
hailing from down east they 're no strangers to the sub .
i reviewed their original line not long after they introduced themselves on here and just recently they sent over a lovely little care package which included their new signature series line .
i can already say they make some mighty fine juice and this new signature series just reaffirms my feelings .
here are my honest thoughts on the signature series line from fogged out vapes https foggedoutvapes.com/collections/signature-series-line .
bottles the juices come in dark coloured 60ml chubby gorilla style bottles with colourful metallic designs on them each with a backdrop representing a different iconic city .
sinful is represented by a shot of las vegas bliss bear an image of toronto 's skyline lust shows the eiffel tower in paris and serenity i 'm not sure but it looks like a north american city 's skyline .
the bottles are gorgeous although they 're among the most difficult i 've ever tried to photograph because of their reflective nature .
the ratios vary just a bit so i 'll list them with the flavour descriptions .
here 's a shot of the lovely bottles https imgur.com/reryer4 i was sent .
setup testing was done mostly in a hadaly clone with a three core alien 3x28/36ni80 build from our very own u/saddlehorseblues 4/5 wraps on a 2.5mm coming out to 0.28 ohms and running between 35-45w .
using puff cotton rda rinsed and rewicked in between .
here 's some shots of the fresh build http imgur.com/a/yihxk .
a perfect blend of grape soda and mountain dew .
this has a perfectly balanced cola base and is so good it 's sinful !
on the bottle it just says grape and lime soda which i thought was a pretty odd combination but the full description from the site lists the lime as mountain dew .
it 's definitely a unique flavour in that i do n't think i 've ever tried anything even close to it aside from mixing up some swamp water as a kid when you mix different kinds of pop .
it 's a sort of oddball mix of a powdery candy grape sort of thing with a shot of lime i do n't actually taste mountain dew myself .
i also get less of a soda and more of a candy sort of taste from it and in an odd way it kind of reminded me of fundip and lik-a stix .
as odd as the mix is it 's actually quite tasty and for a guy who typically is n't a big fan of grape flavours this one at least manages to stand out in a crowd .
how well it will go over with that crowd is anyones guess but i 'll admit it even surprised me just a little bit .
the grape is sweet and tasty and the lime gives it just a little bit of pop .
it 's not super tart or anything like that just a nice little bit of tang in the mix .
definitely a stand out in the field of grape flavours and one that 'd be well worth checking out .
it 's still a grape flavour and something i do n't normally vape so probably not .
with its light and creamy whipped cream base and fruit mash-up it 's sure to bring bliss to any vaper .
apple strawberry mango and cantaloupe will for sure please your tastebuds .
here 's another flavour profile that does n't usually go over too well with me mixed fruit blends .
on the bottle for this one they simply list fruit cocktail whipped cream so when testing it out i had no idea what was in it .
in my notes i listed apple pear peach and melon which turns out i was n't too far off .
to me it mostly tastes like white fleshed fruits like apple and pear in a sweet syrup and reminds of of those del monte fruit cocktails we got in our lunches as kids the ones with only ever one cherry in them dang cherry cheapskates .
i do pick up the mango which to me tastes almost more like peach in this mix and it kind of gives the flavour a bit of thickness .
the strawberry was probably the only thing i could n't really pick out but i 'm guessing like most fruity flavours it 's just there for a touch of sweetness .
it 's very bright and fruity with a nice sweetness to it but there 's more to it then that .
that bright fruity cocktail is paired up with a good helping of whipped cream and while i 'll admit it mostly gets buried in the mix it definitely adds a nice bit of creaminess to the flavour .
whipped cream as a flavouring can sometimes have a slightly dry chalky feel but bliss does n't have any of that just a nice fluffy whipped cream to bring it all together .
one of the more addictive generic fruit blends that i 've tried and definitely a standout in the anonymous fruit mix category .
chunks of cinnamon toast crunch with macadamia nuts and pecans embedded in white chocolate and drizzled with maple .
this has subtle hints of coconut and will leave you lusting for more !
hands down my favorite from the line and another standout in a field of fairly common flavours .
i love cinnamon sugar flavours there 's literally a million of them out there but when you 've tried as many as i have they can start getting a little boring .
most of them are just a sprinkle of cinnamon with a bit of brown sugar or maple and that 's about it .
with lust the boys at fogged out kick things up a notch by adding a few unique touches to the mix .
white chocolate macadamia nuts pecans and a hint of coconut really turn this flavour up to 11 .
yeah i know i only gave it a 10 but i do n't want to break the scale and turning it up to 11 is just a figure of speech .
but regardless of the scale and score this cinnamon sugar flavour is fantastic .
on the label it just list cinnamon toast crunch cluster but after initially trying it i could immediately tell it was n't just your typical cinnamon brown sugar flavour .
i mean i do get that somewhat typical cinnamon toast sort of taste but i also get a lovely rich creamy nutty undertone .
in my notes i listed pecan or walnut as the nuts and looks like i was n't too far off .
it 's got a lovely rich almost roasted nut flavour which really adds depth to the flavour .
white chocolate adds a nice sweet creaminess tying it all together and giving it a slightly thicker body .
the drizzle of maple and the hints of coconut i 'll admit are like snowflakes in a snowstorm with so much else going on in the mix i do n't really notice them .
the coconut may sneak through on occasion but i would n't really call it a main element .
the two are more or less bottom notes in the rich and complex blend .
easily one of the best cinnamon sugar flavours i 've tried in a long while and one that wo n't last long with me .
rich and creamy vanilla gelato enveloped with smooth and silky limoncello .
i 've been really big in to lemon flavours the last year or so and serenity sounded like it was going to be the next one on the list but i have to say i was just a little bit let down by it .
do n't get me wrong it 's still a nice bright lemony flavour but it 's just a touch too sharp for me .
like i do n't really pick up much of the creamy vanilla that i was hoping for and mostly just a get a bright slightly tart limoncello .
i mean sure i really like lemon flavours but this one is just a bit too one dimensional for me .
i would have really liked to taste the creamy vanilla aspect of it a bit more .
for me it 's mostly a fresh lemon crud sort of taste and little else .
at least it does n't taste like pledge like so many lemon flavours before it .
it still gets a passing grade from me since it is a rather nice lemon flavour and i 'm sure some folks out there will appreciate it 's simplicity but for me personally i need just a bit more .
not likely although i might try mixing it with something else .
i really got to hand it to fogged out with this signature series line .
all four are beautifully done and although serenity did n't exactly win me over i 'm sure plenty of others will appreciate it .
the entire set is well deserving of the signature series moniker and are welcome new additions to the fogged out lineup .
if you have n't given fogged out vapes a try yet what are you waiting for ?
they 're a great company who make some really fantastic juice ! !
so a huge thank you as always to jeff and the boys at fogged out this lineup is a hit !
how many times did hela says 'kneel ' in thor ragnarok ?
some things to say before i get into the details .
when i say failures this means past streaks not this one .
this is a milestone to me not a goal so i am still on the clock ya feel me .
i am getsexy2017 and i did the nofap challenge .
i tried to not orgasm look at porn or masturbate for 90 days .
i can confidently say now i love myself for the way that i work/am and the way i strive to better myself .
that took the longest to be able to say .
for the longest time i was unhappy with where i was and it was even hard to get up some mornings .
my favorite thing that happened recently one time i even got extremely drunk and told some girl i slept on her floor all about nofap and my streak .
rather than being disgusted she told me that it was cool to see someone that was genuine and someone who did n't try to even remotely hit on her .
so my streak has brushed my inner most thoughts .
also 2018 is the year of respecting women get on that boat boys and girls .
over time i have just toned it more for myself .
people just come and go as i change myself and get further in this journey .
i thought that getting a girl would make me feel less lonely but it was just another thing that i thought i needed .
now its more for friendship and then maybe i 'll find someone that sticks above the rest .
i can talk to people now and people try to talk to me .
one thing i want to prescribe to people is to try the calm app https www.calm.com .
they have a great 7 day free program that helped me get into meditation and mindfulness .
another place to check out some mindfulness is the subreddit of r/meditation .
i guess this is where i attest to r/nofap and the cult lol .
superpowers are real but they are just a part of my personality now .
if more come to me i will fill this part in .
i like to have someone 's back be their hype man .
i feel like i give sound advice where i can and can listen to problems very effectively .
it is also kind of my actual job to be someone 's mentor/hype man .
i can look people in the eyes and i 'm telling you .
attractive.i am pretty sure i am a dime piece this will be short and to the point to not be any sort of douchey or boastful .
i feel more attractive and people trying to talk to me sometimes reinforces that .
do n't find me acting like some trashcan because of this thought .
music has become more and more beautiful it is what it is man people put a lot of hard work into that shit .
i have learned to be less pessimistic and more optimistic .
alot less depression when starting my streak i was horribly depressed .
i know i might have not have had it as bad as some others but boys please .
trust me in that saying things always get better .
we only notice we are out of the shitter when we are on top of the world .
disclaimer if you find that you are depressed and need to talk do not hesitate to find the crisis hotline call 1-800-273-8255 24 hours a day
no brain-fog in classes it is so much easier to be intertwined and actually take in what i am learning .
things come to me more easily and i do n't get distracted with self-doubt and fear .
being able to make changes in my life if i do n't like something .
i can also get more focused and run for longer in the sport that i do .
my time management is not suddenly cured but its better .
i still get lazy sometimes i am just not going to fap during that laziness
harder to stick down to a routine than anything .
but by far the most helpful in my early days with depression and feeling lonely .
being able to quiet my mind was by far the best thing that helped me in my streak .
i am still trying to develop good habits to meditate daily .
i am still skewed slightly from this but i see people more for their personality rather than their outer beauty .
it is so easy to get tricked into something just over beauty and not for their inner personality .
i think it is better to not need a woman when you find one .
you do n't want to find her for sex but love her because you love her as a person .
this love can then blossom into romantic love . ''
being able to talk to people not just girls .
day 0-14 by far the hardest part of the streak holy shit .
this is the time where it takes the most effort because it is the biggest change .
i could n't stick to it sadly but as i write this i plan to start up again .
day 14-30 still some hiccups but the urges are going away .
i felt more lonely in this part than anything .
this is where i may have differed from the norm .
i still felt like i was lonely and depressed in this stage some bursts of confidence but they were short-lived .
this set of the streak for me was a dead zone .
i was never sure whether i was actually changed looking back i definitely was .
urges still come and go but some days you do n't even think about fapping .
day 71-90 hype machine this is where i feel like i blossomed .
this is where i turned into the person that i can say i love .
there are a few single hiccups turning down urges is simpler because personally i feel like i made it this far there is a crowd behind me that does n't want to see me fail .
i became more personable in this stage and i definitely was happier more generally elated most of the time and i kind of just took it all in .
i just want the people skimming this to know .
take this chance to change and better yourself and never look back .
the benefits are real and the life change does happen .
some days it sucks and i mean it really sucks .
i made a new post about tips that helped me out during my streak .
edit6 noticing personality and also addition of the calm app https www.calm.com
would they be good assets for first rounders besides our own picks ?
lou will having a great season i do n't like the deandre jordan portion as much because he is getting old and his skill set is highly based off athletisism but they could be pretty decent players to put around book .
i 'm not sold on it though but hey they have experience and we have n't had luck in the draft recently .
played for a hot minute at launch but had other stuff going on .

i 'm using pcloud but ca n't see an obvious way to backup my usb hd drive automatically so that whenever i plug it into my laptop pcloud starts backing up or syncing its contents .
is there another cloud service that includes this ability ?
this not-so-super-power is the ability to communicate through fruit .
you think something into a banana and the next person to touch that banana receives your communiqué .
if you were trapped on a plantain farm in thailand and needed to give people visions to save you it would be great but other than that it definitely fits the meh '' category .
i remembered reading somewhere that you get 5 or 10 gold when opening a treasure chest when the item number has already been found but i can not find it anywhere .
have i misread this or is there still some value to the treasure ?
my name is n't derrick which is why i ignored the email with his name in the subject line .
the all caps already made me reach for the delete button .
but the email address made me block it as well .
it was a random jumble of letters and numbers and looked like it was from overseas .
i figured it was the latest in this year 's phishing attempts .
the next day there were a dozen more emails for a guy named derrick .
every single one of these came from a different email address .
i went into the spam folder looking for any mention of derrick .
i went into my filters and had my system automatically put any email with derrick in the subject line into the spam filter .
the day after that my inbox was flooded with the same message
there were probably two hundred messages for derrick all from unique addresses .
i spent an hour blocking and deleting them but more and more poured in .
in frustration i closed my laptop and went to grab a beer .
i could just get a new email address but i 'd had this one for over a decade .
besides i still had control over it it was just inundated with spam .
i considered calling the police thinking maybe they could figure out who was sending me this message .
of course after i finished the beer i grew worried about anyone else who may have been trying to reach me .
i decided to post my woes on facebook let people know not to email me and see what they suggested .
i opened my laptop to see that i now had over a thousand unread messages .
i decided unwisely i admit to finally open one of those damn emails and let the moron on the other end know that derrick is n't here .
i clicked on one of them expecting to see a message full of typos trying to convince me to hand over my credit card information .
instead all i saw was a single word stay .
i then noticed that no new messages were entering my inbox .
they probably knew that i 'd opened the email .
i was about to hit reply when a video chat window opened up .
i should preface the next part with this the first thing i did after i bought my new laptop was put a piece of tape over the webcam .
it seemed silly to me because who would want to spy on me anyway ?
i figured i was too boring and not attractive enough to hack .
but that 's what everyone says to do and i figured better safe than sorry .
all the other side could see was a black window .
in the incoming window i saw a young man maybe in his late twenties tied to a chair .
he was naked at least i assumed he was because i only saw him from the waist up .
his arms were tied behind his back and his chest and face were covered in long cuts that looked fresh some were still bleeding .
he was crying but trying to hold it together .
i heard some kind of chittering or scraping sound .
the man 's eyes got wider and he began to sob .
the man stopped talking and looked directly above him .
i heard more of the chittering and scraping sounds .
the chittering grew louder and the man shook his head .
i told you i do n't know where he is !
he began to scream as it slowly coated his face .
underneath i could see his skin turning red and beginning to blister .
he began gagging and thrashing around in the chair .
the substance kept pouring down and after a few more seconds he slumped over .
his head was now covered in the stuff and i watched as his face began to melt and slide down his head .
the top of his head split and i could see his white skull underneath .
i did n't make a sound as i stared .
just as the man 's entire face had melted off four long brown insect-looking arms entered the frame from the top .
they moved toward the camera and i saw that they were covered in long hairs and sharp spikes .
i did n't get a good look at it before the clear substance coated the camera and cut off the signal .
but i thought i saw what looked like a giant cockroach dangling from the ceiling .
the clear substance was oozing out of its mouth .
just before the feed cut out i saw five more of the things crawl into frame .
the video chat window closed and i just sat there for i do n't know how long .
finally i logged out of my email closed my laptop and just stared at my wall .
i left it at home and got the hell out of there .
i told him everything but i 'm pretty sure he does n't believe me .
i 'm not opening my email account from anywhere .
i 'm also not using any of my social media accounts because they use that email .
thankfully this one does n't which is why i 'm pretty sure i 'm safe posting here .
after i post this i 'm going to the police .
i wo n't tell them about the bugs but i will tell them about the email and seeing a person die on camera .
i 'm posting this because i need to put the word out in case i do n't make it .
and it 's not like my laptop 's camera was any good anyway .
there 's no way they saw anything but black .
example of kind of m9 i 'm looking for https i.imgur.com/fpngbnc.jpg
there should n't be any black on the top and no further than the mid point of the blade .
the hole should have the brightest blue going across it .

what are the communities thoughts on keeping it instantiated ?
the vortex is literally brand new i plugged it in to verify it works and tested all of the keys .
i bought one off of amazon and they sent me the wrong one .
it has mx blues and everything works properly on it used it just to test the keys .
got a new phone for work and no longer need the iphone .
the screen is in great condition as it has had a tempered glass protector on it from day 1 .
the body is in great condition as well save for two small nicks on the bottom near the speaker and charging port .
can not see them with a case on it .
phone works great and has n't shown any signs of slowing down .
will entertain trade offers for the phone but more looking to sell the board than anything else .
is there anyone in eu that has gotten their rising sun package ?
i got an email with a tracking number that i suspect is rising sun but it only says they have information about the package to be delivered and nothing new has happened in 4 days .
i really like the dlp rules and hosted gmail s/mime for some of our users .
i was hopeful that cloud search would be a free offering but we can live without it .
i just played someone with a full prem meta team and a 4 or 3 chem messi he was up 3-2 in the first half and started time waisting literaly not even passing it around the back just standing still with

since steam does n't yet have this feature ability to sort your library by games with vr support is there any workaround vs. going manually through all the games in the store and see which ones show as 'in library ? '
i personally run no assist because i feel i have more control over the car .
i want to create an ios interface for a game engine written in c that uses standard input/output as its api i.e .
i know it would be possible to do this on macos via nstask and spawn a subprocess but i 'm curious how would i do this on ios since that 's not possible .
would i have to directly call the source code functions that would process the text input received by the engine ?
or would i have to port the entire engine into swift myself ?
another solution i could think would be to make it a hosted rest api but then i could n't play it offline and it would be expensive .
i love kucoin but it seems like their intrests are vastly misplaced .
i have been holding a rather larger ammount of neo on kucoin enjoying daily gas dividends untill recently few days ago all history of my dividends in the income section disappeares .
i am now missing days worth of gas payments and so are thousands of other users .
have you guys had the courtesy to make an announcement about it or even an update that you are looking into the issue i might not of withdrew all my neo .
i suggest everyone else does the same untill they address this issue .
i kinda love janet and michael 's friendship especially when he refused to kill janet due to what they 've been through together .
but eleanor and michael has the most profound relationship in the show .
i think they 're very similar since they 're not-so-great people trying to be better and i loved the scene where he cries over his friends you 're my friends and i wanted to save you ! ''
guys i was on 10 day streak before and i relapsed then i was back on day 4 and i relapsed but this time the urges were very much strong so much strong that i couldnt sleep it was like mind killing but i tried and i slept and i wokeup at 2am and i relapsed to porn since i had classes the next day what to do about such urges guys

i put aside 5000 in a dependent care fsa in 2016 .
i forgot to submit a claim to recover the remainder of the balance .
i did n't even know the money was still there until i went to recover the last of the 2017 account and saw a balance for 2016 .
i called the provider and they told me to take a hike .
it seems crazy to me and incredibly frustrating to be looking at an account with a balance that i ca n't access .
that 's my goddamned money and they tell me i ca n't have it .
hi i 'm driving an old nissan versa with a cvt .
i 'd like to learn the right way to drive the car uphill say in the mountains and downhill .
uphill put it in l '' low gear and slowly 20-30mph go up .
downhill ride the brakes from time-to-time with overdrive '' turned on to prevent the transmission jumping around too much between 3rd and 4th gear .
i 'm learning so any constructive advice/tips on driving in the mountains with an underpowered engine tied to a cvt would be most appreciated .
hi for the past few days i 've been preparing a list of compatible mods for cities towns villages settlements camps towers forts and basically lots of structures and buildings to fill out the empty space of all the skyrim !
i 'd like to check how many people would be interested in such list so here 's a strawpoll
the list will be pretty big so far i 've got about 20 mods some as optionals some as complementary for five major cities and the whole list consist almost 100 mods the numbers will probably change .
the list will be divided into segments so if you only want mods for major cities or just new settlements then it will still be useful for you .
on alpha release the list will be very wip '' work in progress '' and i 'll need your support and feedback on mods that you test or know that are compatible with another because i 'm not able to test everything with every single mod myself it would just take too long .
i 'm hoping to reach the beta state by editing the alpha post with your help .
the alpha release of the list will contain '' and or '' between the mods that are either compatible based on the mods ' descriptions or just on my assumptions so treat it as a test version !
the future goal is to provide a complete and fully compatible list but for this to happen i need your feedback on these mods either from your own knowledge or experience .
when we will figure out the complete list i 'd like to re-post it as a final version .
all of the mods listed are gon na be available on sse nexus later on either between alpha and beta or after the final version we might be able to expand the list by adding oldrim mods as optionals that can be easily !
converted by those interested but i 'd like this list to be completed independently '' of oldrim .
what 's it 's gon na be based on ?
subjective opinion which is always obvious but mostly on the development of the mod it 's compatibilities used resources .
it will mostly matter only in cases of main cities cause there are tens of mods for for example whiterun but only 3 mods for dawnstar .
if i 'm not sure i 'll most likely provide different options like this or this and let the discussion below the post develop .
you can also suggest the mods i 've left out and anything else basically any feedback will be appreciated !
that 's all for now thanks for the attention and remember to vote and comment !
currently i live in folsom and i 've seen more people at corners or supermarket entrances sitting there for hours at a time holding signs asking for change .
i 've seen a lady walking down a dirt hill with 2 suitcases in the morning apparently camping out overnight up the hill somewhere under the trees .
the proximity of the light rail gives more people access to folsom and i think that 's part of why i see more of this now .
there 's more reports of vandalism theft and other crimes in my area based on police logs than i 'd like.. for example someone busting a fellow community resident 's car window and taking a coach purse and cannon camera at 11 am in broad daylight on a sunday.. and 4:30 am suspicious activity with 4 people walking around our community scoping things out and pulling out chrome pipes held in their hands.. the incident was probably foiled by them seeing a resident or two and also because one of them called the police that arrived about 10-15 mins later at which point the suspects were in their car and took off with the police apparently/hopefully giving chase .
but i 'm wondering if the same issues exist in rocklin or if it 's better in these areas .
i 've only visited rocklin for a few hours at a time and mainly in newer parts like new blue oaks where the movie theater and rc willey are located .
also how resilient is the real estate market there compared to folsom ?
i know when the last bubble burst in around 2009 folsom fared relatively well .
just wondering how rocklin did or would do in the future in comparison .
unfortunately this is a bit short but it 's a true story of one of the most terrifying nights i have ever experinced in my life .
to preface this story i will give you some background on me of what i was like when this happened .
at the time i was in middle school and was not very happy with my life .
i was constantly tease about being over weight and was even bullied to the point of physical assult by others .
trying to tell adults only resulted in worse things happening to me .
i was a pre-teen who wanted to die and hated myself more anything else in the world .
i was isolated emotionally and had no one to talk to .
my parents are n't the kindest people or forgiving .
they have always made it clear that they have no remores or worry for what ultimately happens to me .
so like anyone that feels alone i was constatly seeing things .
oh yes i could see strange things all around me .
things others did n't consider odd or could n't even see .
in the night in question that i am about to talk about was a friday night .
i only remember because i was able to sleep in without any incident or anyone really bothering with me .
i lay in my room that i shared with my baby sister .
we are only five years apart in age and despite that i got along with her very well .
not so much with my other sisters all of them were older than me .
as i lay in my twin sized bed i did my best to fall asleep .
though it escaped my grasp and all i could do was simply lay there and wait till i finally tired enough to sleep .
apparently it did n't take as long as i thought it would but it did not last .
with an odd taste in the back of my mouth i opened my eyes to see i was facing my sisters bed and the door to our room .
it was wide open because our parents would n't allow us to close it .
even though having it opened always made it impossible for me to sleep .
mainly because our bed room was a corner turn from the hall way .
leaving a space that made it impossible to see if someone was coming .
at night when the house was dark i could see shadows forming and moving close to the edge .
i was always scolded for telling my parents about them and instead of easing any of my fears they only made me feel like i was insane for even thinking that it was possible .
i could see one the shadows as if something were going to peak from around the corner any moment but it never did .
i tried to focus on something eles and returned my gaze to my sister 's bed .
i paused to listen and wondered if she was simply in the bathroom but there was no sound nor any light coming from the bathroom .
if someone was in the bathroom i could see the light from under the door because it shown on the wall and could be seen from where i lay in my bed .
without any real reason i sat up in my bed .
thinking back on it i 'm not sure i even did this of my own accord .
i was afraid of the dark and still kind of am that apparently did n't stop me that night .
without any caution or thought i made my way to the hall way and found that the front door was wide open .
i looked to the other end of the mobile home i lived in with my parents .
their room was at the very end and their door was also open .
i walked past the front door to my parents room and looked around to find that both of them were not in bed .
i looked up to the bathroom and it was empty too .
heading over to their walk in closet no one was in there either .
my brain was screaming for me to hide to stop and just stay still but i left my parents room and went to tell my oldest sister .
she had the room next to mine and going in to her room i found it empty as well .
i closed the door to her room and headed over to the front door to see if someone was out there .
i figured i would see them standing there or maybe even sitting there .
where had all my family gone why was i alone and the door wide open .
thank god my mind finally took over of my body and i ran to my room intending to hide in there with the door shut and locked .
at least that was the plan and as i ran to my room i did n't make it i was reaching the end of the hall getting ready to turn into my room when it happened .
i remember the horrible sensation of biting my tongue and feeling blood drip down my face getting on the carpet and that i was so scared .
i was really truly terrified but i did n't have to deal with that much longer because it all turned black on me .
i woke up the next day in bed feeling a horrible ache behind my eyes and my nose still hurt .
sitting up slowly i could hear the television on in the living room and the sounds of food being cooked .
i stumbled out of the bed and went to the hallway looking around and at my parents who were sitting in the kitchen .
i wanted to ask why they had left where had they gone and what happened .
i would tell you the whole argument tha followed but i 'll keep that short .
i was told that i was dreaming that i watch too many scary movies and that i needed to stop making things up .
i was treated like i usually was with dissmissal over anything i felt .
i left them and headed back to my room head staring down at my feet i saw something caked on to the carpet .
i dropped down and started to pick at the stuff and brought up dirty brown dried blood .
i thought this was enough that this would prove it but instead they simply said mud . ''
they say i lied that i made it up for attention and that i need to stop watching horror movies .
i remember that night and i know and feel deep down in me that someone is watching me .
not at all times but every time i 'm out and out .
i can feel like someone is watching me from just far enough that i ca n't see them .
i 've been told by only a few people that if i feel that way it means someone is watching me .
that even though as we have evolved humans still retain a few sense that can alert us .
so even if i thought i was alone at times i know that someone was watching me but would n't let me see them .
i know it sounds so out there and far fetched but this happened to me .
this horrible thing that i wish was a story that i could laugh off and say got you . ''
is actaully something that i had to suffer through .
i will never forget that night no matter how hard i try .
a because everyone left me alone at a time when i was so scared and b there are moments in your life that no matter what happens you will never forget .
if you decide to share this with anyone and they get inspired by it or someone wants to read it out loud you have my permission .
anyone has my permission to recount the events that i have posted up here .

i just switched to sprint from verizon this past week .
now that i am at work i am noticing that i have really choppy service it goes in and out and is out more often than not .
for most things this is n't an issue because i can just connect to my work wifi .
this is an issue however for texts and phone calls .
i have been trying to research what to do and it looks like wifi calling is an option .
i have a google pixel brought with me from when i had verizon and the option for wifi calling is n't showing up ...
i have seen some posts where people have the wifi calling option on pixels and it looks like sprint also supports wifi calling so what is going on here ?
essentially i just want to receive calls and texts to my regular number while i am at work over wifi .
hello i need 0.005 eth for cover my transaction fee .
i want to sell token and do n't have eth for tx fee .
will pay back after token sell so i borrow your token but sorry no interest
if you want to help please comment and i 'll reply with my eth address
please note it does n't involve the bitcoin protocol whatsoever .
just wondering if could it be possible to poison someone 's dns cache and redirect any api request to blockchain explorer services in such a way someone sees a transaction happening and confirming while instead it did n't happen at all
33yo decent income rent living in a big city in east europe bachelor 's degree and amazing work experience for the last 8 years international rotations well paid travelled like mad engineering consultant and key account manager etc .
last 1.5 years got a stable 9-5 job in engineering for the first time not travelling too much sufficient personal time all good and somewhat relaxing .
nowadays looking for another job i am somehow between worlds not wanting all that amazing experience to go to waste with another easy peasy 9-5 job meanwhile looking for the comfort of a not so stressful job .
i am at a point where i have to look for another job things changed where i am and i have to go and i have no idea what i want to do .
i am not complaining about not finding a new job or having financial issues one way or another i can find a decent job that pays sufficient for my rather modest lifestyle .
somehow it feels like i 've let myself fall in complacency but i do n't want the exciting '' jobs that i 've had before .
know any good books that may help me figure out what is it that i am not seeing what 's actually the root cause of the issue ?

fun fact cynthia nixon wants to be governor of new york https www.cnn.com/2017/08/09/opinions/cynthia-nixon-mulling-run-for-governor-alaimo/index.html ... which is why we are randomly getting political news alerts about a thing she said .
we want to be transparent with our thoughts behind the fee structure .
here 's an example of why ours is massively beneficial to smaller scale sellers
if a seller makes a 5 sale on tcgplayer they would receive 4.06 after paying 0.94 in commission and fees .
if a seller makes a 5 sale on transmute they would receive 4.49 after only paying 0.51 in commission .
the key difference is that we do n't charge the 0.30 on every sale that other sites charge ever .
many sales are for sub 10 amounts and those sellers get destroyed by that 0.30 fee .
we chose to absorb that fee to support smaller sellers and allow them to make the most money on their cards .
we are always looking for ways to lower fees and this is the most sustainable one by our numbers .

i agree that would n't be having this discussion if clinton had won though that is primarily because a non-trump us government be it led by clinton or any other major candidate from the last cycle would have already retaliated against russia in an appropriate fashion .
but russia is culpable regardless of the result of the election and they and putin will face a reckoning for that in the not-too-distant future .

a resolved stony silence is as close to an automatic victory against affinity as you can get .
that 's why if you look at affinity 's sideboard it has 10 cards designed to prevent that from happening or removing ss if it hits the board .
ss shuts off mana abilities for mox opal springleaf drum and darksteel citadel which can make it difficult for affinity to cast answers even if they have it .
it also turns off ravager steel overseer and cranial plating most of affinity 's win conditions .
kataki is still playable if you prefer but you 'll probably win more games with stony silence in the end .

laca is a team player and i do n't think he 'd mind sliding over on a piece of paper as long as it 's explicitly clear that they will all rotate during the game .
if we keep giroud it enables us to switch to 3atb to hold a lead with the subs of auba and laca for giroud and kola/amn .
players still talk about our style of play when they come here so i think mhki and auba will be thrilled to be in a fluid front 3 to see if they can compare to neymar suarez messi .
moreso because we already have a very young team which is getting younger as each year passes .
they do n't want a bunch of rookies trying to figure everything out .
it was only really good for the first couple of events once people learned what they were doing it became rapidly obselete sadly .
its not that complicated wb is not efficient by default same as iverson for example .
centers are efficient even though the barely have any offemsive skills look at dwight .
wb is inefficent yes but i dont think that any other player at 6´3 with his shooting skills could be an mvp caliber player .

go on craigslist or facebook marketplace and get what you want used you can probably get everything you need under 200 excluding crib and car seat .
also—-if your family is throwing you a baby shower take advantage of that .
babies need some accouterments though usually not as much as you think .
bouncer swing walker and the rock n play were my go-tos .
i can not emphasize the rock n play enough—-those were the only nights i actually slept when i had a newborn .

moses that one time he went to the cs house in chicago ?
as the last comment said but they also buffed the scaling of the other infusions slightly .
i have been trying out dark infusion on a alot of weapons and they all seem to be decent if not really good
no there was plenty of computer gaming even before the internet era
you can tell lightroom to store presets next to the catalog to make this easier .
the catalog can not be on an smb share .
it has to be attached to the machine either externally through a usb or similar or internally .
this is what i 've been saying all along .
and i assumed everyone was on the same page back in october .
we take the qb at 2 and then let eli try to win in 2018. ala favre/rodgers via 07-08 .
and i 'm in agreement with your post above about busts .
it 's a foolish notion to not take a qb because he 's not a sure thing and assume that other positions are .
we currently have 2 top 10 picks on the roster that play ot and cb who are huge busts with the cb perhaps somewhat salvageable .
furthermore i despise the idea of going into the draft with not drafting a bust as the top priority .
that 's cowardly and the mark of a losing organization .
that 's not to say we should ignore red flags .
we need to do our homework on all of these prospects .
but at the end of the day if we 're in a position to draft a guy with franchise qb potential but also has bust potential you have to take the risk .
j. winston had red flags and has been a disappointment so far but i guarantee the bucs do n't regret the pick .
congrats to the jags eagles and vikings for making the final 4 with average qb 's .
i guarantee you none of them will be back next year though .
perhaps philly with wentz but not with foles but you know what team will be ?
the one with the hof quarterback going for his 6th sb .
that 's what we 're after with the 2 pick .
not some guy that will help 37 year old eli make another run .
last thing perhaps the most delusional argument being talked about on here is that somehow we 'll be in position again to draft a franchise qb .
that in 3 years we 'll be picking top 3 and they 'll be a great qb prospect waiting for us .
or magically a great qb prospect will fall to us in round 2 or 3 one of these years .
because you know that 's a regular occurrence in the nfl .
as if these guys are a dime a dozen and grow on trees .
you ca n't wait around forever for the perfect quarterback prospect to fall into your lap .
most of the time you 're just making an educated guess about a guy .
it 's naive to think we 'll be in a position to draft a franchise qb again anytime soon .
if you 're going to do mssql server there 's a decent document https docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker for how to do it .
if you 're looking at mysql or postgres you 'll want to figure out how you want to manage replication/consistency between container instances .
it can be done but with additional complexity that you may or may not want to have to manage .
and i think people hear this stuff and assume they 'll be paying the government .
essentially the government becomes a wholesaler while the telecoms are still retailers competing with each other to provide better price/service .
yeah i want to make sure i do this right
should i start licking bowling balls to get strikes ?

we all have potential we just got to find the right road to get there .

you deleted non-trolling oc concerning philosophy which this forum needs and i will address later so you are in a sense my enemy .
this is a sub for rolla mo ... a city in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere missouri .
most of the posts are mst students asking for advice posting rooms/houses available for rent and occasionally someone talking about st pats .
why would you ever come here for deep philosophical discussions ?
why would you think anyone would be open to discussing philosophy with you when you open with insults like ok morons '' and then go on rants about how dumb people are ?
insulting people is generally not the best way to get them to listen to you or take you seriously .
tl dr nobody gives a flying fuck about your long-winded and poorly structured rant .
man ... that do n't sound fun ... but i would too probably out of being human and having a heart ya know

i do n't know but my pilot is sitting in seat 23 h
they 've fucked up excessively over the last month and a half but i think that most of what they 've done prior to that had a pretty good ratio of success to fuckups .
hence saying that their incompetence is classic '' seems to be a gross overstatement that 's more circlejerky than anything .
i 'm all for criticizing them to push the game to a better place but i also like to be fair and balanced when i do that .
but hey the sub seems to be in a particularly circlejerky mood lately so grats you probably win the argument and i 'm wrong for having moderate opinions .
my hands have been cold as long as i remember but i think tobacco has made it worse .
my point is that instead of people on the left recognizing they were wrong about the ok hand symbol they are doubling down '' on it saying it 's a racist dog whistle .
because i truly believe the difference between being actually racist and pretending to be racist to fuck with people is virtually nothing .
but in that photo there 's no way to tell the difference between someone who 's racist someone who likes memes or someone who is intentionally trolling liberals .
the guy in the redcap next to jp is a known white nationalist so in this case we know .
that 's why the photo is a good gotcha .
i still do n't think jp is racist as you say not everyone who uses pepe is racist .
i do n't tar and feather someone just on the basis of flashing an ok symbol either i look for context other actions they 've taken or things they 've said in the past .

some of these stocks are so overvalued right now its insane .
not a damn thing that could be seen as a positive to society or labor has changed in the past 4 years to justify the jump the market has had other than the greed of the investor class causing pumps on top of pumps designed to increase net worth .
wages have been stagnated and jobs and hours have been cut .
its so goddamn bad on labor right now that every time i look at the market and hear a major stock is pumping i know some poor bastard working for them or some poor supplier got screwed .
we serious need some decentralization and local production along with nationalist and labor protection laws to stop some of the worst corporate behavior that is driving the market to extremes it should not be and net worth of the investor class they do not deserve .

amazon made a really good choice here to rework the episode order of electric dreams .
the anna paquin one which is episode 1 here is near the end of the uk run .
i actually have them in the uk order obtained via piratey means lol not amazon the one i just watched was the hood maker '' which does not have anna paquin .
if you like anthology uk television i have to recommend the show accused which i think is on acorn .
it 's about a different crime every week and it 's some of the most riveting tv i 've watched .
set sail for the nearest estonian/russian/tongan/congo streaming site that has accused in its bounty ! ''
you want us to see other players yet they act as animated background for most players .
if you backtracked with your emphasis on speed running and instead require more focus for any challenge slowing down the game forcing players to take a break there would would be more place to add content that would allow more visual player character interaction .
right now if you do any of it you 'd only enrage everyone who 's rushing to improve their ex/hour ratio .

my main gripe is their repeated usage of wands connecting .
it 's impossibly rare requiring as i understand it not just the same core material but from the same individual animal and yet from goblet on any time two wands are near each other they connect .
it drives me absolutely crazy because it matters that harry and voldemort 's wands are connected .
it is relevant to the story and the filmmakers are more worried about having a cool visual effect to over use .
also the utter lack of any attempt to hide from muggles .
harry is set to go before the wizengamot for using magic in front of muggles so let 's ride our broomsticks through metropolitan london traffic .

if people did that in real life you 'd think they were kind of a jerk .
in a movie you get that it 's a storytelling convenience .
having already explained the free will that forsaken get the game does n't need to re-explain it every time you see new forsaken .
and as with the physical size npcs often have or with the unrealistic size and population of cities in the game you 're not always meant to take timelines in the game literally .
sometimes they skip stuff that would be boring and pointless to show and sometimes you have a quest to immediately save a drowning baby but you run off and do some other quests first .
neither of these should be taken as evidence of lore canon .
sorry that 's supposed to be a little too pagan for me '' .
i would argue that even if it 's true it 's not respectful .
yeah i used to have a current event scattergun that i really enjoyed but the thing that gets me with skins which i realize now is a very odd and nit-picky thing is the tier color overlaps strange and as i do n't have the money for high tier skins and like kill counters i tend to avoid them .
the new skins added to the game are really nice and i would probably be more likely to pick one up but there 's just something about tracking your progress and success with stranges that i have to have .

i have used this funding in the past to hire students for our church .
other times it is way more trouble than it is worth in terms of the student helping the church
this program canada summer jobs is a federal job creation program for students .
the main purpose is to help students grade 12 university under age 35 get experience in the workplace .
in my setting this will be my first summer not hiring between 1 4 students in 15 years at my current church and i have been training students in pastoral work for the past 25 years at former churches i pastored .
if the second time in 25 years i will not be supervising students .
most often the students increase my workload and do n't always add to the ministry .
it will greatly damage christian camps who have their financial model based on this kind of funding being available so they can have a high ration of workers to kids .
we will need more donations for camp ministry and more volunteers to fill various positions .
as i read the application documents this is less about abortion reproductive rights and more about government overstepping their boundaries .
they tried to phrase the added requirement as a charter issue .
this is incorrect as the charter of rights and freedoms gives people freedom to hold opinions different from the current government and to work within the law to change laws we feel are morally wrong .
a few things happened from the way they worded the changed requirements .
1 it looks like they want a statement that you agree with the current government 's position on these issues .
2 the charter has wording about freedom of religion .
it seems from the wording of the csj statement of agreement that our church would be unable to discriminate '' based on religion .
that is like asking us to guarantee that all candidates for pastoral ministry positions have to be given equal opportunity for hiring regardless of religion .
because of the nature of pastoral ministry we not only need to hire in my case baptist pastoral students but we hope for a level of competence and familiarity with baptist teaching principles and practice .
i just hope it does n't lead to armed conflict within the us .
the problem is both sides are so polarized right now and just the wrong spark could set the whole thing off .
or maybe we 'll just all be watching agt while eating papa johns and not really care .

a way to do this where you could have instancing while keeping things mainly as they are now in the main game space and not creating a safe zone '' and a camping situation could be ...
have this social island be ringed '' in a large fog bank .
no matter what angle you approach the fog you would only see a faint darkened outline of an island deep within the fog .
as you approach from open water and enter the fog bank you begin instancing .
as you exit out of the fog into the center you are now in the social hub island instance .
the fog bank ring should be a fairly good distance from the island within to include more area for the larger amount ships to dock around island as well as space for people to have ship races around the island closer to the fog bank or fish or whatnot .
if you are in active battle or have fired cannon etc within the last xx mins and/or have any loot at all on board as you attempted to enter the fogbank you would not instance and would simply come out the other side of the fog bank would be much smaller in this case .
this would keep people from exploiting the game mechanic of fighting to keep your loot and not simply running away into a safe space '' if being chased or trying to avoid battle .
you could do all the social things mentioned in this thread at the island swap crews meet up drink grog play games races play music dance .
show off yer fanciest gear even drunken brawling etc .
you could even keep weapons active that way if people want to have drunken shoot outs after a bit too much grog they could do that as well .
just have it that if you shoot someone you 're jailed for a min or two unless your crew breaks you out earlier .
the dead pirate would simply re-zone on their ship or at the bar etc .
and continue on their way or look for revenge .
having active weapons would also allow for shooting ranges or galleries ... think shooting bottles of grog/ducks/pirate cut-outs moving side to side carnival style etc .
after you 've had you 're fill of the social activities ...
you get back on your ship or another if you 've swapped members around and head for the fog bank in any direction you wish you are then brought out to the main instance may or may not be the one you left this would be a good way for rare to populate the main instances as there would be lots of traffic coming and going into and out of the social space .
using this process would keep the main instances more fresh '' as turn-around would be higher and continue on your way within the main world .
having this be the process would negate any need for safe spaces '' within the greater world keep people from camping the perimeter of the social island as there 'd be no way to know if/when/where a ship would be exiting the fog bank they would n't have treasure anyway as they could n't bring it in with them allow for both sets of gamers pvp/pve to have the things they want in the game without hindering each other .
it would also negate the need to have seperate '' servers thus permenantly breaking the player base apart .
pve'rs are happy to have the social bits they want when they 're feeling the need for it .
pvp'rs are happy because there are no safe spaces in the greater game and the turnaround of possible targets '' is refreshed faster as people enter and leave the social for the main game world .

there 's no quick and easy fix for this other than adjusting the code for each individual game at which point they might as well be doing full fledged remakes .
even without it though i doubt i 'd be 10/10
ceo is a nut but does not seem like its truly their fault since it 's california 's govt natural disasters there .
q1 is n't a big money quarter so i certainly think this is a major overreaction .
this miss may attract an activist investor to challenge jim to straighten up or have him remain chairman while a new ceo gets in there .
your theory implies that all the genes get included in the pool and disolved .
for that to be true the gene pool must be expanding all the time then .

i like the sheepsfoot it 's great for slicing .
the drop point is probably better for piercing but i use my knife more for work than opening packaging .
slicing through line and synthetic rigging is very important where i work and the hallow grind and mirrored edge will tear through line like butter .

i could sit here arguing and considering all day when personhood starts but being forced to be pregnant at any stage is unacceptable to me .
unwanted pregnancies and unwanted children lead to all kinds of personal shit for both .
as for q.4 i would n't say that having consensual sex should be a signed acknowledgement of possible pregnancy .

is it understandable to like a place for what it is though ?
it is a harsh place with brazen people old decrepit towns vast ranges of wilderness and is also pretty safe from any natural disasters .

over 150 variables to tune a gun yet recoil and spread were chosen .
it has been pointed out by many that this approach is contrary to the db philosophy of rewarding good aim in gunplay .
i am struggling to see the reasoning behind lowering the dps potential of a weapon through horizontal recoil and spread .
spread forces the player to disengage after multiple shots or reduce movement speed through ads .
if the goal was to reduce ttk i do n't see why an incremental damage or fire rate nerf is n't acceptable .

hit me up on kik and we can talk more about the details of what kind of possible scenarios we can play out .
the most important thing for me is just that you are dominant preferably with a strong build but not required and like to role play in more than just 2 or 3 word sentences .

earlier last month the israelis working at the aqaba desalination plant decided to reroute water from jordan to israel without consulting the uka authorities.their reckless actions have cost the uar millions in damages as temporary water shortages resulted in reserves being used .
ten of these israeli engineers stand before the court under charges of criminal negligence breech of public trust and theft .
given the charges these engineers stand before a minimum of 5 years in prison .
avi einstein shlomo hariri ben avigdor shmuel leiberman neftali benot benjami tenyah reka vylakova aisha bernstein hassan taimi and barakah barakat shall therefore stand trial .
the evidence presented to the judge include security camera footage implicating each and every member of this group as well as eyewitness testimony from the other operators of the plant .
this would be a relatively easy trial however life is often not that simple .
there are many in the uar that were not aware that the desalination plant was partially run by israel in order to indirectly provide water to the people of the west bank .
many of the hardliners would likely object to this and call for less lenient punishment and revenge for the helicopter attack granted that damage was averted just in time thanks to our power n the field of anti-air operations .
nonetheless the 10 accused eagerly await the judge 's judgement .
i suppose they 're still in nyc after the show on saturday .
they were in a rush and i could tell they did n't want to stop to chat so i did n't try to shake hands or ask for a photo .
i 'm actually not certain i would have been able to because i was so shocked that i was pretty much rendered speechless .
he seemed to get the message and thanked me .
i 'm a little mad at myself that i did n't manage to say anything else like thank them for their music like i have always wanted to .
but this is the biggest celebrity sighting i 've ever had as in they are personal heroes of mine and i never expected to meet them and i wanted to tell people who will get why i 'm internally freaking out right now .

i mention all this because of an idea with a long history in this movement that rationalists should win '' .
they should be able to use their training in critical thinking to recognize more opportunities make better choices and end up with more of whatever they want .
on the other hand can we say that winners must have been practising rationalism quite well consciously or not ?
one time winner can be attributed to luck or endowment like being born at the right place at the right time which is kind of luck as well .
btw who are the long term winners in this world ?
my best guess is the oldest monastery in the world https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monastery_of_saint_anthony .

the livestream mentioned that there will be a contest wherein the character from feh with the most votes will be made available to everyone .
i wanted to open this discussion to hear everyone 's different opinions and analyses on what heroes they think should be voted for and which should n't be and why .
for example b ! lyn is widely considered to be a very unhealthy character for the arena meta therefore she should not be made available to everyone a bit late for that one though .
of course some people will simply vote for heroes they have always wanted but never been able to get and that 's fine .
edit just want to point out that b ! ike will be on an upcoming banner for sure unlike hector .
so while he is a logical choice he probably is not going to be the most elusive .
have you ever wondered that sometimes but really this happens every time you walk into a shop you see millions of people staring and the confidence you once had sometimes just begins going down and down and down.. when really it should go up .
who cares who stares as long as it 's not at your boobs or making you feel uncomfortable then who cares ?
i mean lately i went from hating going to the shops to that 's all i really wan na do because it 's probably because when you do n't work or have a job you sort of just wan na get out but always have that anxious fear about what 's gon na happen if you do .
like imagine yourself walking into a shopping centre and everyone staring .
you may be thinking why do people stare ? or really ?
you have nothing better to do ? or wtf ? which honestly is my favourite one .
no seriously instead of feeling down and letting people who stare get to you remind yourself who you are and what makes you comfortable .
if you felt good and comfortable when you walked out of the house then damn feel comfortable wherever you may decide to go .
they are just cowards who do n't realise that if they were being stared at they would n't like it either .
if someone stares just mentally put the finger up and keep doing what you came to do .
who cares if you think your are n't attractive enough i feel that way every day and something i realised today was that even if i 'm not attractive i 'm still beautiful because i be myself and not allow others cowards or even jealous whores get the better of me .
this is my life and i 'll live it the way i want to !
one is a hollow cylinder the other is a silly hollander .

how do we feel about how skills relate to weapons this time around ?
it seems to me that the new skill accessibility diversifies potential builds and can change priorities in combat .
for example getting critical draw 3 online seems more difficult than acquiring the equivalent in previous games .
this changes great sword because draw sniping is offensively weakened although still useful for getting safe hits .
with the great sword 's new combo options plus the more limited accessibility of critical draw it seems to me as though weakness exploit is preferable .
this is especially true as the visible damage values provide immediate feedback on weak points drawing gameplay decisions towards efficient targeting .
on top of this focus now potentially adds 20 to charge efficiency and gauge efficiency !
it seems as though in light of all this critical draw is more icing on the cake than substance for great sword .
it seems as though the attack cycle for great sword starts as it always has draw sniping but the weapon is now much more sensitive to additional attack opportunities such as from staggers trips breaks and so on .
this shift in the weapon 's preferred tactics really began with monster hunter 4 but now it 's easier than ever to build around its combos .
the 20 increase in gauge buildup could have implications for long sword switch axe dual blades and charge blade .
in the case of the long sword focus 3 could enable the extended spirit combo as the gauge value added by focus plus aura bonuses and the spirit thrust could enable constant spirit blade offences .
this is relevant because the spirit blade attacks are roughly 30 more damage efficient than your standard overhead strikes .
focus 3 also greatly empowers switch axe phials power phials are obvious beneficiaries but there are also major potential gains in elemental and status attack dominance .
what are your thoughts on potential builds and strategies given the changes in skills and weapon mechanics ?
i 'm getting the impression that armour skills in monster hunter world want to funnel hunters towards the extreme conclusions of their weapon 's potential .
out of 24 foci i 'm excluding unique gift because it is n't a defined focus exactly half have direct combat application .
this leaves only 12 foci to focus on skills three of those are lead two are psionic and one does n't have a skill at all .
i 'm trying to run a game with pre-designated characters where combat truly is a consequence not a foregone conclusion .
i 'm running into this wall if i make this non-leader character completely non-combat and give her hacker and wild talent to start what are the other four foci she 'll take by level 10 ? ''
she can level up both level-1 foci but then still needs to select two more from a very small pool .
let me be clear on that lest my neutral language be misinterpreted .
after a very long gming hiatus i 've been convinced to run a game again and the deciding factor was one of the players linking the free version of stars without number .
since then i 've read the pdf before bed and on breaks at work from front to about the middle and i 'm truly impressed with my first impressions of the system 's sense of balance the author 's exhibition or illusion of realism-based knowledge and the dude 's vocabulary .
i just want more non-combat foci available in a system where so much advice begins with some variant of do n't shoot unless you have to and then shoot first . ''
notably missing from the list are foci relating to administer exert know perform and trade .
work also is not represented but like unique gift it 's an undefined skill .
to give this post a point are there more foci in the paid version ?
i will buy it regardless it 's just a matter of when .
if it has more foci i 'll get it sooner .
if not i can wait and let other expenses take priority .
if there are not would anyone like to share non-alien human-appropriate and non-combat preferably homebrew foci ?
i 'm trying to cash out my dividends but etherscan keeps on saying that it 's unable to locate the transaction hash .

the main syrian opposition body boycotted the peace conference in the black sea resort of sochi in russia on tuesday dealing a major blow to moscow-backed efforts to launch negotiations to speed up a political settlement for syria .
a group of opposition delegates including members of the armed opposition who had flown in from turkey decided to stay put at sochi airport in protest at syrian government flags and emblems that were on display at the airport .
the conference endorsed a quot democratic quot path for syria through elections and called for respect for the country 039 s territorial integrity .
the peace conference started after a two-hour delay with lavrov reading out a statement from president vladimir putin saying the conditions were ripe for syria to turn quot a tragic page quot in its history .
un envoy staffan de mistura who has been leading the talks in geneva attended the sochi conference .
mistura said the participants agreed to have the sochi process aid the talks in geneva which is the legal platform for resolving the syria crisis .

i took the oa this evening and the auto-grader could not successfully process my spreadsheet for grading so the proctor had me submit it through a link for manual grading .
is it just a mentor opening the file and clicking submit themselves or actually going through the file item by item to manually grade ?
i 'm primarily wondering how long this process will take .
now that we have rock ele in console rag i want to try to tame one solo any ideas or advice ?
we have a dell md3200i setup in our colo attached to a couple esxi hosts via iscsi .
it has been working without an issue for a couple years now but it 's running low on space .
i ordered some drives from dell and im ready to install but as this is the only san ive worked on i wanted to double check something first .
by adding the new disks and creating a new virtual disk/array would there be any risk to the vms that are running off of the original array ?
ive done multiple vd 's on servers with perc cards a few times without any issues and i dont believe this setup would be too far from that but would appreciate it if someone with more experience working with sans could chime in .
we 've been using xero but have n't really been too impressed .
i am a player with 3k hours in game .
i do n't want any hate towards me the amount of hours i have in game does n't mean i 'm better than anyone it just means i know what i am talking and i 've been playing ever since it first came out
and ohhh boy what happened to the game i loved ?
i used to be able to play this game for 8-12 hours a day and still have fun with it .
right now i play for an hour and im already bored .
not gon na talk about bwc cause in my opinion the map is trash keywords my opinion
i was so excited when they said z1 was coming back .
i do n't think i 've ever been that excited before .
i join the game and i see what happened it 's not the z1 i wanted .
it was n't just the map that was special it was everything about it too .
the new base building the new raiding the new movement the new everything ... oh boy am i disappointed .
did n't you guys say that you were adding new base building cause of the fps lag ?
before it used to be only near mega bases .
now even a 1 foundation fully built makes the game lag .
everyone has the same design there 's no challenge there 's no different designs unless you 're a role player .
the new way of getting scrap metal is boring and does n't work most of the time .
and crowbars dont break why are we not able to loot cars anymore ?
remember when you used to be able to loot cars and go for scrap runs and loot crowbars ?
what was so wrong with the old base building ?
it 's just too much and raiding is not fun anymore .
before you used to have to think where the loot might be .
normally a clan would have that smart raid guy or sometimes you would hit the loot room by mistake and the euphoria was just the best feeling ever after a successful raid .
making a farm or more and farm sugar to craft ethanol and go raid .
i understand that now you can craft yeast again but the looting is so garbage .
the cabinets never have anything on them all you do now is loot lockers loot the floor and leave .
the fact that you can find ammo boxes is cool but normal bullets are too hard to see .
it 's also a bit too hard to find bullets who even crafts bullets anymore .
oh wait why even bother they will be logged out with anyway .
do n't have anything against it tbh think it should n't be a thing but it being in game or not does n't bother me .
one of the best things in the game and you managed to mess it up too .
this is one of the main reasons why looting is so trash right now .
there are so many items and all of them are trash and not worth looting
crouching feels clunky and stamina runs out too fast .
i can just change my brightness and im good .
but sometimes the fog bugs and no matter how bright my game is it 's still hard to see .
this game used to be fun playing solo and in a clan .
loot is so hard to get and raiding is so easy even a 5 year old can raid a base and find the loot .
solos loot for hours clans come and take it within 5 minutes .
while before you would have a chance of protecting ur base by shelter blocking or place walls while getting raided right now it 's impossible cause by the time u run back to base you whole days of looting got ruined within 5 minutes .
all we needed was content fixed delay and no snaking .
it 's not content and this was all a big mistake .
how does daybreak manage to mess up 2 of the games with the most potential in a few months .
i have put 4000 hours in 2 daybreak games that had potential and both failed miserably .
h1z1 did a good thing and started listening to the community and reverted back some stuff .
if we ever mention the word „revert on discord you get banned .
it 's the way devs want it to be and if you dare to have a negative thing to say you 'll will get banned .
all we asked for was snaking gone we instead got a cheap copy of the game we once enjoyed .
up until now i rarely played any games that needed a headset playing most mmo 's solo or on the rare occasion when i did group up i got by with the crappy setup i got as a gift a few years back .
well turns out the quality is a little better than garbage but not by much .
i cut in and out a ton and it 's just not very conducive to playing with friends when they can barely hear me or make out what i 'm saying because my mic cuts in and out .
so i 'm looking to get a decent headphone/mic setup .
if possibly i 'd like to keep the budget under 60 .
looking for something that 's comfortable to wear for long sessions at a time with a built on mic preferably the adjustable mind with some form of mute button should i need it but not a dealbreaker if it does n't have it .
so i 'd appreciate if anyone could just point me in the right direction i 'm trying to coordinate to hunt monsters asap .

tl dr looking for a decent headset setup for ideally under 60 but if it 's worth it or makes a big difference i can go higher .
comfortable headphones for long play sessions with preferably adjustable mic with option to mute but none of those options are dealbreakers .
i 'm looking for a word ... it 's similar to collateral damage '' or the ends justify the means '' kind of along that same concept ... basically a word for something you 're willing to sacrifice or see sacrificed in pursuit of a long-term goal .
it might be sacrificial lamb '' but that does n't sound right ... is there a similar term ?

hi tbh typing this feels kinda awkward and i 'm not the best at expressing how i feel .
but do you ever have those days where you feel completely empty inside ?
for instance right at this moment at 1 in the morning january 31 i feel as if my hearts not beating and i 'm just watching time fly by .
i want to have that feeling where i can feel my heart pulsating throughout my entire body .
to feel that adrenaline kick in that excitement that lust but instead i feel dead .
i know this is something i should get checked out by a therapist or someone but i 'm terrible at explaining and i just worry they would n't understand .
anyways it 's late and i should get off .
for anyone who 's ever reading this thank you .
i feel somewhat better knowing someone will read this .
hoping that as advertised this is just a place to say whatever you like that is n't fully popular .
i know a lot of military vets and a fair amount of them are pretty decent guys .
buuut that 's not all of them and i keep meeting more that i have no motivation to know .
because a lot of them are just dickheads with a gun .
abusive to his children to the point where his wife left him .
but being in the military garnered him immediate respect because he was willing to be paid to shoot at people ?
i think that a lot of vets do what they do because they believe in this country to which i say good job .
if you 're doing it to kill people legally then what the actual fuck .
tl dr not all military veterans deserve immediate respect .
a lot of them are scumbags that did n't fit in anywhere else and whose only skill is pointing a gun and shooting .
feel free to advertise your club or request a club to contact you .
long story short i was trying to troubleshoot a laptop i bought from a pawn shop two days ago which had already had some issues now solved but in the process i seem to have screwed up the wifi adapter .
i had to disconnect it to remove the motherboard and after disconnecting and returning it it fails to load drivers .
the offending adapter is an intel centrino wireless-n 6150 .
it 's listed in the device manager claiming to not have any drivers installed to it it did before i started .
i 've tried both using the drivers intel provides to download and reloading the drivers that windows has built in for it .
neither worked citing an error 10 '' for the device failing to start .
i 've already rechecked the connections both the m.2 looking slot it uses and the cables leading from the adapter to the antenna .
nothing appears to be wrong there and it 's the same way it was when i found it .
i do n't understand why it 's failed my best guess is maybe esd or something when i removed it .
do you have any advice or clue what the problem might be aside form damaged hardware ?
if all else fails i 'll just get one off ebay to replace it but it 's beyond aggravating to finally fix one thing only to have something else instantly stop working .
also a word for the people who buy from pawn shops if they spout some shit about not being talked down to a lower price without removing a warranty find a different company .

i took a two week vacation in hi with my iphone 7 and i was sooooo happy when i found out mint has hi on their list of supported states .
the coverage there was great and even faster than my hotel wifi .
i was in a tall hotel but i had no issues no dropped calls nothing .
it was a gift to get that sort of speed there .
my bro also has mint and told me he had no issues with his iphone 6s .
my dad works at at t and i still choose mint and recommend it to whoever i can .
maybe some people took profits worried about what trump would say in the address or maybe they sold to negatively effect the market so he could n't pimp new highs ?
this is my first post and i 'm posting from mobile so sorry if there are any errors .
i 've been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year and a half and we recently moved into our first place together .
about a year ago he told me that he had all of ex girlfriend 's nudes which made me slightly uncomfortable so he deleted them without hesitation .
my computer is getting repaired right now so i 've been using his with his permission .
i was doing homework tonight and downloaded a pdf of one of my textbooks .
i went to dropbox to easily access it on my own computer once it 's repaired .
it was logged in to his dropbox account and right on the home page were all of his ex 's nudes that he saved .
it does n't show any dates but it said recent above the files indicating that he 's recently opened them .
he came home drunk after spending the evening with his coworkers and i asked him about it .
i 'm aware that i could have waited until tomorrow when he was sober but i was upset .
he started laughing and said that it 's something all boys do so it 's not a big deal .
he also admitted that he knowingly kept them after saying he deleted them .
to make matters worse he texted one of his best friends and his coworker that i found his secret nude stash '' and that he fucked up and did n't know what to do .
but to my face he could n't stop laughing and never once apologized or showed any remorse .
he was even laughing asking me if i looked at the nudes .
after all of this i tried to have some alone time and retreated to our bedroom to finish studying but he followed me .
i said i wanted to be alone and he kept asking to cuddle .
i said no and went to the bathroom the only door that locks in our apartment and he tried to open the door with tools .
i feel betrayed and like he made a fool out of me by not taking me seriously .
i do n't know how to approach this tomorrow .
i 'm sleeping on the couch tonight as i 'm upset and he 's passed out in the bed .
do you think my feelings are justified and if so how do i approach this tomorrow ?
also do a lot of guys really keep their ex 's nudes while they 're in a long term relationship ?
tl dr my boyfriend said he deleted all his ex 's nudes but i found out he knowingly had them saved .
i talked to him about it he said its something that all boys do and did not apologize .
is it wrong to be upset and feel somewhat betrayed ?
i know it suggests my computer is too slow but other programs can play it just fine .
it 's a video a friend took of a local monument with a drone i planned to use vlc to separate it into frames so i can use photogrammetry to make a model for 3d printing .
if someone has a better way to do this i 'm all ears .
i 've been hearing about uo for decades and have decided to play it for the first time .
looking for server recommendations as most other discussions talk about stuff i do n't understand pre this shard that .
i mostly enjoy very hardcore games like eve online mount blade escape from tarkov x3 albion prelude etc .
a helpful community that welcomes new players is a must for me .
not sure about standard xp rates but a less grindy server would be great too .
so i 'd love the help from this community to put together a partslist thats in the 600 700 please help me and thank you

my girlfriend recently started wearing glasses and was embarrassed to wear them .
i think they look really sexy which seems to really surprise her .
i tried them on and she seems to really need them but tries to avoid wearing them .
if you are in a judicial committee for apostasy the conversation does n't last very long .
if you watch youtube videos of these meetings it 's like an hour of pseudo debate and it goes straight to asking loyalty questions and demanding affirmative responses or else .
within an hour and a half most people are toast .
even murder or the worst of rape or child rape would drag out a multiple hour possibly multiple session meeting .
there would be considerable time spent on repentance and debate among the elders about repentance .
it 's as if disloyalty to the organization is considered more immoral and more worthy of swift decisive punishment than the most heinous of crimes that could be committed against your fellow man .

i 'm coming up to a part where another character is going to find her manuscript and read a bit of it .
i do n't want to fall into the informed ability http tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/informedability trope where people praise her writing skills but you the reader never sees it .
any extracts '' used would only be a few lines/paragraph long so writing it would n't be difficult but i also do n't know if my writing style would be the character's writing style if that makes sense .
b write the extracts but try and change my writing style for them .
c try and find someone else to write the extracts
d do n't use any extracts and just try and avoid the informed ability trope somehow .
oddly enough i 've never written a writer before so i 'm at a loss here .
okay i feel awful so i apologize if this is worded badly or is hard to understand at any point .
pretty much the last 6 months have been pretty shitty for me .
coming to terms with my 3 year relationship not working out and just of recently having broke up .
insanely lonely and i also am incredibly behind on college work .
the only time i am happy lately is when i am out drinking/talking with girls because i guess i am getting that affection i miss and desire so much but i feel like this is a lot more than just being upset over a break up .
i am not sad about the relationship not being there because it was mutual and we both accepted it was not working but i feel insane amounts of loneliness .
not something a 20 year old should not be feeling but i just feel like i am fucking up college and all that now because i honestly feel sad all the time unless i am out doing something proper or interesting so i struggle massively to actually work .
i just woke up not long ago after a night out and i instantly tried to get my friends to come out again because i cant get back to sleep and have my insane feeling of sadness the moment i am awake .
i guess i just really crave that attention i once had every day for over three years and now i am crashing massively and feel really shit .
again maybe i am totally wrong but i feel like this is more than just me feeling bad over a breakup because i have really similar emotions to back when i was diagnosed with depression which i have overcome way back about 5 years ago .
i do n't know what i am asking for on here but i guess this is a cry to help to strangers on the internet because i really need some advice on my life right now or some nice things said because i feel terrible and i am honestly just scared .
thank you for taking the time to read this .

i 've got a 10 minute video of doing thai chi on a boat in halong bay vietnam .

i have been using the nvidia highlights feature since it came available and has always work relatively fine but now its giving me some problems .
the one that is driving me crazy is that when i end the match and go back to lobby nvidia highlights appear as always to saw me the videos it has recorded during the game but when i click to see the videos it looks horrible in terms of smoothness it looks completely stuttered if that means that it looks like if the game is running at 15 fps .
if i go to the folder where the game has recorded this videos and open it with vlc it looks ok thought .

i have a friend from a long long time ago i 'm still facebook friends with but have no contact with anymore so none of this is with actual people .
she 's very involved with her church and mission trips and she recently had her first baby .
she posted his name and his middle name is an african name .
it 's a name from the area she 's been on mission trips before i think ethiopia .
she said this name means leader and she wants him to lead people to jesus .
i feel like this is both really weird and racist .
she used her child 's name to show people how awesome of a christian she is because she 's been to an enormous continent a few times and learned some new jesus songs .
but then i was wondering am i the one being racist here ?
i saw this unusual name and my reaction is that she 's racist instead of just thinking she named him something weird like everyone else in the world .
so the question for the group do you think this is christian showboating to an extreme level ?
do you think i 'm racist for thinking it 's racist ?
do you have anything else you 'd like to share ?
so i put together the following parts list and before having the sense to post it here for feedback i pushed the button .
i needed to get this quickly as my 2007 macbook pro is on its last legs .

as of lately i found the performance of the device as being quite underwhelming .
using skype slack and outlook at the same time makes the device run very poorly .
you can see the delay between typing a character and having tit display on the screen .

what can i do to make the device run smoother ?
... which means the j-hope and suga 2018 birthday books will be the last r/bangtan projects books ! !
but seriously we 've reached out to bighit clarifying our birthday projects describing that our books are a collection of letters from international fans .
however they explained that items shipped inside a box will be treated as a gift and will be politely declined after march 30th .
we 've considered the possibility of the books being classified as gifts so we 've had time to think about the future letters to bts .
our ideas include both digital collections as well as physical prints think a4-sized cards or pages of letters .
we will have a proper post outlining this in more detail once we 've sent out the last books but we wanted to update everyone and maybe spur you into sending your j-hope and suga submissions .
meanwhile please feel free to hit us with suggestions for the future bts letters !
again this is your last chance to be in a shiny patented bts projects book ! ! ! ! ! !
the last books include 2017 census along with the j-hope and suga books .
thank you to the commenters who brought this up !
while the fan club manager mentioned that anything in a box is considered a gift this does not imply that packages not-in-a-box will be considered as not-a-gift .
their intent is still clear that is no packages and we would like to avoid having our letters sent back or rejected .
it sounds like french but it 's like some made up language .

devils advocate here why do we as americans have to support the children of other countries .
allowing them to gain an education that otherwise another american would take up seems detrimental to our society .
furthermore just because she could n't get that education in her own country due to her gender does not mean she has a right to one in america .
edit wow people seem disagreeable with a simple question concerning the ethical implications of allowing children of illegal immigrants access to our educational systems .

the problem is that at higher levels of government the burden of proof is so high and the privileges so much that it 's nearly impossible to prosecute .
you can film a lobbyist with 10 hd cameras from every angle giving a congressman a bribe campaign contribution and mentioning that he 'd like favor on a particular bill and that still would n't meet the burden of proof required to prosecute the congressman for corruption .
to successfully prosecute for corruption you 'd have to prove '' that the congressman gave favor in exchange for '' the money that was given to him .
but no congressman or lobbyist is ever going to be stupid enough to come out and say that 's what 's going on .
it 's already an unspoken rule so you 'll never be able to convict .
i just got a babyhawk r 2 days ago and loved it .
unfortunately i could only live it for 3 batteries and then more 2 fried spontaneously mid flight for no reason..
but i just want to say that alex was playing well with the 49ers under harbaugh in 2011 idk if i spelled his name right .
the team also had their first playoff victory since 2002 bc alex finally got the stability he needed during his time there .
but the following year harbaugh basically kicked alex smith to the curb mid season due to a concussion and went with kaepernick .
after alex was traded to the chiefs everything went to shit again for the 49ers until garrappollo came along .
it took them years to rebuild ever since smith left .
so i do n't think the 49ers can even say they ca n't win a ring with alex bc they never gave alex the chance to grow under a stable team especially for being the first team he 's been in for the nfl and the same coach that believed in smith after knowing what the team was putting him through during that time backstabbed him .
expanse has them dropped muting the end of the word so season three will be uncensored though .

most the time they do n't even have time to stress patch because everyone wants everything to be fixed as soon as possible so that 's what epic is going to give them .

the pump does n't always hit 200 ... that 's only on headshots .
most of the time you get a singular body shot in and the opponent quickly builds and you have to build and get into a complex fight .
very rarely does the pump just clean up the job immediately .
i still use it but i switch it only for the purple tac .

the longer the shot travels through the monster body the bigger the damage .
due to the long windup having knowledge of monster behavior and moveset helps in executing a perfect dragonpiercer .

i know i hate it when the stupid kid takes my report and reads it in front of the class like it 's his too .
oh i 'm sorry i did n't mean to sound condescending i just mean endearing like he looks so genuine and nice especially with his interviews that it makes him just really likeable .
i believe it 's the longest village in the country .
the concept of gender is really only which set of genitals do i feel more comfortable with '' .
it 's quite a bit more than that it 's about masculinity vs. femininity .
most people are mostly in on camp or the other but that does n't mean that you ca n't be manly and knit it just means that that 's uncommon .
as such someone being in the middle '' of the proposed spectrum does n't really make a difference for their gender given how expensive complex how bad the collateral effects and just how generally troublesome reassignment surgery is .
if you 're andro you are n't strongly in either camp .
you can still be a sexual boy or girl and probably are .
there 's also no reason to expect you 're dysphoric about it
they are just a feminine man in a dress/masculine woman in trousers and that 's perfectly good and fine .
i do n't really care what people do for fun tbh
in truth perestan did not care over much if a man was a bastard he had seen enough back home to not have it rub him raw as it did some .
but the one opposite to him suited the lordling ill too cocky and arrogant by half perestan could see the worst of the stain of bastardy on the man .
still the man seemed to be able to swing a sword around that gives him some merit at the least .

i really liked the quadlock but it made the phone sit higher than i liked .
i ended up making my own mount with a garmin stem mount a cheap case from amazon and an adhesive garmin adapter from ebay .
i did n't trust the adhesive on the adapter so i 'd recommed maybe some 3m double-sided tape with a high load rating .
i personally just added super glue but i wish i 'd done the 3m stuff because the glue is ugly .
i 'm debating switching to a quadlock case with a garmin/quadlock adapter .

he was a passionate and remarkably successful independent playwright/producer/actor for the stage there 's a reason he got so many opportunities in hollywood so quickly .

well i would be annoyed enough but that certainly put you out of the running now .
it 's true the character relationships does not progress linearly because of drama but its usually not stagnant either and the main couple do hook up before the end .
a lot of the players tune out/get distracted anyway but there is probably several more elegant solutions than this one .
the 'episodic ' idea seems really good as some players have been happy to play the same character for the last year and a half and others want to switch every second session so both parties are happy .
it might be a bit of a challenge to get an overarching story going but it seems like a really good solution .
on one ouch ... but on the other hand man does it feel good to get the hero you want on the final day .

learn which areas are more susceptible for cutting corners where there will be less scrutiny when your boss reviews your work .
pick samples with bias that you know will pass .
for controls/ipe make up the fact that you observed parameters or did reperformance .
be liberal with your 'inquiry ' and 'observation ' descriptions .
overall try to match prior year workpapers ' results except for known areas of change in the current year .
use verbose overwhelming documentation to fatigue your reviewer usually only works if it 's a carry-forward from prior year not a new memo you wrote .
use generic blanket tickmarks that say you performed something even if you did n't particularly useful in large high-volume tests .
errant pen marks and squiggles on a report could actually be considered evidence of management review and signature .

you absolutely do n't need 100 accuracy just a statistically significant accuracy above random chance to seriously undermine the concept of free will .
if you can to a statistically significant degree determine what button a person is going to push even before the person is consciously aware of making a decision to push that button that is significant .
again anything less than 100 is a probability and again to say that people are more probably to choose to do one thing or another is fundamentally not the same as saying the choice does n't exist and i for one would never make a claim that people are not more likely to do one thing or another just that it 's possible to deviate from the most likely path which conveniently is the same way all of reality seems to work if you recognize the significance of quantum behavior and even atomic behavior not that that 's proof in and of itself .
that new study has many of the same flaws as the last .
it 's merely approaching a better prediction of when the decision is made which of course there 's going to be brain activity preceding the choice and in particular the action taken based on that choice and there 's still the latency that comes with human human error .
think about any timing game you 've played in your life .
or even if you 've ever tried to play music .
people are n't especially accurate at doing this even if the moment they 're supposed to press the button or strike the instrument is known beforehand .
it does seem like they attempted to account for latency a bit though which is nice .
but really let 's say you had a robot that read the data and attempted to hit the drum at the same time as the person who 's data it 's reading .
even if it were 1:1 at that point the robot would be essentially the same as the drum itself an instrument the mind is playing .
triggering the robot through brain activity would not really be any different than when you send the signal down your arm to your wrist to hit the drum if it were accurate enough .
i 've actually often dreamed about having software that could simply play the music that i imagine in my head because working through instruments is sluggish .
the latency and inaccuracy between my mind and my appendages is sluggish .
in order for any prosthetic limb controlled by the brain of any kind to be useful it would have to be almost if not exactly or even better yet more responsive than the limb it 's replacing and the 1:1 robot is certainly within the realm of possibility in my mind .
i know when i improvise i 'm often thinking about what i want to be doing several beats
here 's the real problem with the whole mind/body thing and this is all admittedly my belief which is necessarily not the same thing as the truth because i 'm of the mind that the fundamental nature of reality is unknowable in its entirety .
i do n't think that either the body or the mind has complete control over the other they 're feeding into each other and influence your mind and everything outside of it have on reality is coming from both simultaneously .
and given that we know that the subatomic particles from which everything we observe in the material world is built comes in and out of superposition and that that phenomenon works its way into atomic structures why would n't the mind have a property that functions in a similar way ?
imagine the hypothetical world where we had a pause button for reality and we had a way to acquire allll the atomic information in the entire universe while it was paused .
we still would not be able to predict the next state of reality because the future lies in superposition and only distills into a single state as it passes through the moment .
the universe itself navigates through the many possible future states of reality .
the functions of the universe happen throughout us our bodies and minds this is fundamentally true and even and possibly especially scientific understandings of the universe say the same thing .
it 's our experience of our selves as a distinct perspective of the universe which i know sam and many people here are operating on a different definition of the self one that arguably does n't exist navigating through the possible future universes state by state moment to moment .

a guy from seoul university called andrei lankov had a personal bnlog where i learned everything i know about nk .
he also published a book on amazon i recommend .
trump 's economic effects have not been felt yet .
tax reform barely rolled out let the companies file a quarterly before you assume anything .
i still think it 's best at least after nise .
maybe some more photos please bud it 's hard to get an idea of the space with just this one
the ending to this absolutely struck perfect with laura 's character development over the years .
i really really hate that she has n't gotten nearly the spotlight as wolverine she should have because taylor is killing it with her .
this whole run has been fantastic even at the weaker parts and i love that we finally get laura and the others calling out the real people who would have responsibility for all the pain they 've caused .
i assume this is speculation and you did n't take part as much of this is wrong .
it does n't make sense financially to make it an open test or alpha .
as the player count grows they have to spool up servers which costs them money before the game is even in early access and they are taking in funds .
they know better than us how many players they need to collect their data .
this is speculation on my part but they left the servers up longer than they needed to for the participants benefit..
he is a shit poster from the donald you can tell because he deletes all of his comments so that people do n't write him off as a shit poster as they should .
i worked at robert half briefly i made a comment 7 people busted out nerf rifles and unloaded on me .
i went home and looked up a nerf gun mod that lets you turn an older version of a nerf gun into a fully automatic nerf machine gun .
i 'd look up exact details but i 'm too drunk .
there 's a whole series of videos on youtube of asian people making gas-powered and air-compressed mods of nerf guns .
bug me and i 'll dig up better information tomorrow when i 'm sober .
why not use rechargeable rules ? ie a wand has 50 charges you use up 40 of them so you re-fill them at the price it normally is 15 x lvl x spellvl x number of charges for wands that why he can simply recharge it
edit reddit does not like me using the actual math symbol
they will hug you and tell you everything will be alright .
bitcoin is not dying and they will still try to convince you that lightning will save you next year if it 's ever ready .
remembe last april it was supposed to be ready in the summer ?
but if you do n't watch the anime you can not say you know gintama .
it is very different from any other anime you might have seen .
optical has good enough bandwidth for stereo for sure .
now that does n't include high res files like sacd/dsd or dvd/blurayaudio .
i wanted to make sure i can still patrol i know that sometimes healers are reserved to the back lines but my power does give me a brute rating . ''
i ca n't hide my intentions from you so i will come out and say it .
i would prefer to not have to heal criminals .
i can understand making sure they do n't bleed to death but if possible i do n't want to heal villains .
at least not healing them more than is needed to stabilize them for conventional medicine .
because my patients almost always come out better than before they were wounded . ''
apparently there 's a gene determining whether you get stinky pits and it also affects earwax .
if you have dry flaky wax you can probably do without deodorant .
if it 's wet or sticky no such luck .
i 'm using fedora w gnome 3 for a years on different machines .
the part i dont really get is how the process of getting joe on the trip was .
did they already book and pay and then her sister «surprised» her or was it more deliberate planning from your gf side .
if your gf had nothing to do with him getting on the trip i would be a bit more chill .
the other way around i think i would start packing because that would have been extremly disrespectful of you while the other can be chalked up to bad judgement in best case .
like someone else said watch her a bit closely when she get back .
if anything happened it would be hard for her to act the same .
it would also be a good time to agree on how you guys will handle past flings etc .
to be fair the forsaken guy was smooth af with the mom .
if you chase every pump out there i guarantee that you lose 95 of the time .
i know how you feel i went in huge on a coin that no one was talking about because i thought it had potential .
i made over 20k in 4 days when it skyrocketed .
once you achieve something like that you want the same thing to happen again and again .
you might win big once or twice but you will get burned in the long run .
i was looking at xrb very seriously when it was 4 but i decided not to act .
i am not the least bit mad at myself about it .
there was absolutely no way of telling that it would get up to 40 in a week or so .
that being said these shitcoin pump and dumps will soon be a thing of the past .
we may have already seen the peak of it and we could be seeing the beginning of a decline that might never come back .
i hate the whole hodl meme but a legit coin with a working product and history time patience massive gains 9 out of 10 times .
six months from now you will be saying the same thing trust me .

i 've given up high thc entirely and really only smoke anything that 's 1 thc and 15 cbd .
luckily i live in a place where that sort of thing is n't too hard to come by .
i do n't use it often but i feel it 's the perfect balance for me .
i still get high but it 's almost as if it 's the level of high i 'd get from normal bud when i had a huge tolerance with less anxiety and paranoia albeit some .
it does n't mentally linger a few hours after using i come more fully down from it than i ever did with anything thc heavy .
cbd has a longer half life so it makes sense that you can feel out the thc while it 's there but are ultimately left with just the cbd counteracting much of the thc fogginess .
the secondary effects on general mental health and ability are much less compromising with mostly cbd when used sparingly at least .
i feel no desire to consume anything high thc i know it will just make me feel shitty .
i can still smoke when i 'm hungover or after a long night otherwise and not feel it permeate into the next day .
i would fucking love to see this dude in midnight green
sure they 'll mature '' into it as you so eloquently said .
it 's inconceivable that one could actually dislike the movie for legitimate reasons after all .
so now all this shit is gon na build up there and impede the flow thus reducing power output ?
let 's do this great thing and make it a great deal on top of it !
hey guys we have to do that thing again .
95 of my money is in etf 's and stocks .
i only trade a small portion of it to satiate my gambling side .
he did well last night added some dynamism and positivity to the role that gini does n't .
i 'd rather not get carried away with a solid performance against a championship side and see him lambasted again in a week or so just let him play .
yeah at this point it 's best for whatever info can come out to just come out .
the damage has been done and the fanatical right will never stop talking about this memo like it 's some sort of smoking gun .
i brought 4 for 13k free playing style 3 scout 2 185
thank you for the warm welcome and letting them know !
personally i think tracer zarya or mccree zarya is the best but hanzo zarya is a good one .
sad we do n't get to see them probably due to how other ults like dragon blade rip tire and of course self destruct are more effective and easier to pull off .
food does n't taste bland to me but i have this phrase it 's all the same '' meaning i do n't really care what type of fancy burger i get .
as for cooking excepting throwing frozen vegetables in the microwave i have n't cooked in over a decade .
not the main character 's actions as much as the ability to have someone see into my memory .
team apparently you 're not allowed to do a four-initial team name unless it 's also a color name so now we do n't have a name are you happy now
grigori yefimovich rasputin is one of the most cryptic historical figures of the twentieth century .
in real life the circumstances surrounding his death were probably exaggerated by his enemies to further the narrative that he was an evil sorcerer rather than a mere charismatic faith-healer with an unhealthy relationship with the tsarina of russia .
in don bluth 's anastasia he has sold his soul for the power to destroy the russian royal family and very nearly succeeds with the exception of anastasia herself .
his demonic powers allow him to warp scenery and explode bridges and things and he also ca n't be killed by normal means only by destroying his reliquary the glowing green weakpoint he keeps on his person at all times .
viewtiful joe was once a regular movie-loving guy with a dumb chin-beard until one day he got pulled into a movie for unknown reasons .
there his hero captain blue bequeathed him the v-watch an item that gives him vaguely film-related powers and allows him to transform into his super form a sentai-style superhero with a dumb chin-beard .
now he spends most of his time fighting big-headed monster people to save movieland and the film industry in general .
creed diskenth is a psychotic killer and always has been .
he 's primarily obsessed with his former partner train heartnet who he sees as the most talented and capable person in the world and therefore the only person worthy of living in it .
creed is eager to kill other people for harming train or talking to him but as the series progresses creed grows as a person and before long he 's also eager to kill people who do n't even interact with train at all .
through the power of tao creed channels his qi into his phantom blade which begins as an extremely long extremely sharp invisible sword but eventually evolves into a living writhing sword that may or may not have a mind of its own .
velvet scarlatina is a student of beacon academy and therefore a huntress in training .
by rwby rules this means that she has a fairly powerful aura an energy shield powered by her life force or something like that and also has a special power called a semblance .
velvet 's specific semblance lets her match the fighting techniques of anyone she 's seen in combat which pairs well with her special weapon a camera that can duplicate a hard-light version of any weapon it 's taken a picture of .
doctor heinz doofenshmirtz is an evil scientist with a terrible past except that he is n't that evil and his past was really only terrible for him .
he 's an inventor of a variety of evil gadgets of varying degrees of successfulness most of which tend to blow themselves up whether or not that is their explicit stated function and it often is .
still they are capable of extreme levels of cartoon physics and while his leadership skills are not strictly speaking existent he brings a certain amount of power to the table in the form of ... well chaos .
josuke higashikata is the fourth jojo whose bizarre adventures enthrall and captivate about half the scramble audience while the other half do n't see the appeal .
like many jojos josuke has a stand a manifestation of his life force and/or soul .
his looks like a person in a weird helmet but it also punches people and sometimes when it punches people it also heals them or puts them back together in a more abstract sense .
for scramble purposes everyone is able to see this stand though they might not necessarily be able to make any sense of what it does .
ragna the bloodedge 's story begins when an evil ghost possessing a man burned down his orphanage turned his brother evil and killed his sister except his sister did n't really die his brother is not actually evil and the story does n't begin there it begins decades earlier because of time travel .
ragna is not very complicated however because his powers actually just consist of extreme combat skill learned from master jubei who is a cat and the azure grimoire which he can use to summon aspects of an apocalyptic beast of pure mana in order to steal vitality from enemies .
in fights he 's mostly a brick but a dangerous one all the same .
zach noveda hails from the almost unheard of but really quite good mother of learning web series where he has been trapped in a time loop for several decades .
he was also a wizard before that even happened so he used much of that time to master an incredible variety of colorful combat spells .
he is n't quick but the sheer number of shields and wards he can deploy is astounding and then he can always cast something to make the earth swallow you up or shoot beams that disintegrate small buildings or otherwise manipulate physics in some way that causes the delicate balance of a living person to become unbalanced in a violent way .
i 've been playing a lot to cope with my anxiety and depression .
i think you came to a great sub because we 're a small group of people that just love gaming .
i hope that the collective love we all share might cheer you up and change something for you .
you 're a member of this community and we need you
petg tubing contains trace amounts of plasticizers if it does contain them at all .
leaching plasticizers is more of a thing with soft tubing .
atlanta opened up a sick new stadium and the fans are excited at watching a group of young future stars play for them before the rest of the world gets to see them live .
you should n't dismiss the s8 so fast it 's a great phone .
and after that there 's going to be new pixel phones .
and then you 'll have to wait for the next note .
and then the 6t is probably well on its way .
now waiting for the s9 i could understand that 's only 4 weeks away but anything more than that bad idea imho .
got ta get myself some peepers then just in case .
i was considering an open shove also but three hands prior i open shoved ak and everyone folded so i was trying to get action/balance my range .
the only other preview game i 've played was ark and i quit playing shortly after it came out .
so i do n't really know what to expect from a preview .
but if i could get all games in preview at half price ya i probably would .
given that most classic fans want some sort of frankenpatch '' of features but not all features of patches 1.1-1.12 i think it will take blizzard longer than june to get classic out .
the testing of this frankenpatch '' will take awhile .
there might be a long beta testing for classic .
if blizzard was just going to release wow 1.12 the i could see a june date .
but as many other have pointed out re-releasing classic with 1.12 would trivialise early content for the hardcore players .
molten core and onyxia would be cleared within days of release .
