thank you for stopping for calling an ambulance and for talking to the police .
if you hit me even a little faster i 'd be dead right now .
you could have driven away and i would never know who hit me .
but you stayed even if you were panicking more than me when i was screaming about how i could n't breathe when i started coughing up blood when i asked you to call my parents .
i honestly thought i was going to die in a puddle at a strip mall but you saved me .
i apologize for asking a question that has probably been asked extensively but there is no definitive answer i can find online so i 'm asking for advice here .
i have a pf30 frame and pf30 bottom bracket and am considering buying a bb30 quarq red crankset do i need to replace the existing bottom bracket and replace it with a bb30 specific bracket or can i reuse and keep the existing one i have ?
if it 's the latter are there any wear-related issues or things i should know ?

wawrinka held a press conference to announce his schedule ? !
in the toughest moments of your career you should be able to count on your closest ones .
so wawrinka basically called a press conference to throw shade on magnus norman .
do you think he will go up in down in value ?
have the coins for him or nif but want the one who will drop the least
shinso http bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/hitoshi_shinso reads the classic gain the power of the person you defeat '' prompt and decides to defeat galactus in as few steps as possible .
for those of you who do not know he has a near perfect mind control that is triggered by his opponents answering a question for the purposes of this prompt assume the mind control is unbreakable unless acted upon from the outside .
so what are the fewest steps he could take in order to become powerful enough to defeat galactus ?
r2 his opponents have been very clearly told not to answer his questions
r3 his opponents know not to answer his questions but shinso has full meta knowledge of their lives

personally i 'm really looking forward to seeing x characters that debuted after the new x-men batch of characters that are n't x-23 hope armor or pixie .
a green lantern set that does n't have any of the other lantern corps especially .
and any number of his other villains we have n't gotten figures for like the shark the invisible destroyer sonar goldface effigy evil star star sapphire ii and the original tattooed man .
green arrow does n't have a huge villain pool but another onomatopoeia cupid count vertigo shado finally .
alot of these characters would actually complete rosters for some villain teams which is a great plus for me as a big theme player .

yesterday my nike janoski max https store.nike.com/sk/en_gb/pd/sb-stefan-janoski-max-skateboarding-shoe/pid-10630332/pgid-12192351 arrived but ... honestly i despise of them the combination of fabrics is not really seamless the half mesh front fabric is too breathable i was expecting something in the style of fall 2016 janoski max https static.supersklep.sk/226723/806980/l/topanky-nike-sb-stefan-janoski-max-black-black-anthracite.jpg which fabric was completely solid which made it great for wearing in the winter not appropriate for fall/winter .
in the same time unfortunately the aforementioned jm 2016 had to be send for rma so i am left with just nike roshe two despite of its thin fabric in front it is quite well isolating i was surprised .
now with a question what to look at now ?
i am left completely empty '' now when jm are no-go for me with this year 's model and i do not want to wear one pair of shoes for a few months and frankly i have enough of two 's holes in the tongue .
low-top/mid-top like nike janoski max or roshe line are roshe shoes mid-top or still considered a low-top ?
if they are considered low-top then ingore the mid-top part
'' features '' soft and comfy like jm and roshe line even though roshes are just much softer than jm basically i need a thick foamy midsole never ever again classic style of brick-feeling midsoles like on casual skate shoes
no preference definitely opened to other options but do not worry i do not think there is any brand which is not being sold in us and eu simultaneously
use casual no running just walking so a comfort is a big variable here .

a mode where all players have their cards automatically level 3 but there is no affect on their actual competitive ranking .
given the incoming changes it seems like this option would fix a lot of people 's woes over i want the game to be balanced for everyone only rely on skill but i also do n't want to be forced to play competitive all the time and possibly screw over my elo . ''
this would be the best of both worlds in that it would not only be balanced for all players in regards to cards but it would also be a casual non-stressful game play experience .
i 'll keep it as short and simple as possible .
ca n't decide between a new basic trim truck vs. older better trim/model but with the risks of not owning/maintaining the car from day one myself
truck will be mostly used as a commuter to work but will not be a work-truck . ''
will need to be able to move furniture bikes etc on occasion .
would prefer 4x4 for occasional weekend warrior offroading but this is more of a hope/want than a necessity
overall my goal is to get a truck that will give me great value quality fun to drive and strong resale value .
i 've always been curious as to why that particular diamond pattern happens .
furthermore i seem to notice it more and with longer streaks when i squint my eyelids starting directly into a light source .

i already ran ddu in safe mode took out my old card and am now waiting for the 1070 to arrive .
my concern is power connectivity my rx 480 only had one 8 pin and my 1070 will have 2 .
so i just grabbed another cable from my psu semi modular and wired it from the psu to the front of my case .
is there anything i need to be especially carefull about ?
already downloaded the new drivers so these are ready .
edit my new card will be the evga gtx 1070 sc2 .
i just found out that it‘ll include „8 pin to 2 8 pin adapter .
i am surprised at how little english information there is on this topic .
my cat is 13 years old the life expectancy of his breed is 12-15 .
he is diabetic and has suddenly this week his health has rapidly declined .
when we asked him what our family 's options '' regarding putting our pet to sleep were he seemed as if he truly didnt understand what and why we were asking .
is it simply not customary to pets to sleep in japan ?
from what i have seen people seem to let animals grow old at home until their organs fail ...
he is part of my very small family and he is the first pet we have had in our lives..
i do n't want to do anything premature but i want to end his suffering..
does anyone living here in japan have any advice ?
i 'm sorry this is n't very well composed ...
without posting any spoilers or anything does towelie do anything except constantly tell me things i already know ?
i ca n't figure out how to disable him either .
i have a premium subscription on an iphone 6s and only recently noticed these issues
when i try to select a track in the middle of a 200 song playlist it defaults to playing the first track .
on the times it actually allows me to select a track it plays the next track in the playlist instead .
so i have to select the track before the song i actually want to listen to .
this one time a woman kept me inside her vagina for nine months .
i had to crawl out of there all covered in god knows what .

i am now eligible to receive part of my bonus but to get it my company gave me a new document that provides more details about how this is calculated and includes all disputes will be handled by an arbiter paid by the company '' .
if i do n't sign i do n't get paid but i am strongly against forced arbitration and the implications there of .
is this something i can bring to someone in government/lawyer or any other recourse ?
if they had provided this information before i took the job offer i feel like i would have less of an issue but this just feels bait and switch having me sign this 6 weeks after starting .

thanks for any input on this as it is the make or break before buying .
it just gives confidence that even if we go sub 10k again in the short term and more people put up sell orders the demand is just bigger right now .
as i was reading and getting ready to respond to another post i came to the realization that enchanting mats might see a change .
as they said items on the ptr are currently dropping from the same mobs as they used to but they are scaling up to the proper ilvl .
with that change thing are now disenchanting to the mats that would come off the corresponding ilvl .
which means that mats from the lower end of these brackets are going to be rarer as time goes on .
probably most importantly are the mats from tbc and mop as both those expansions are at the lower end of the bracket .
which means that we 'll only see those items from people leveling .
now i 'm not suggesting that these mats are going to skyrocket overnight but i 'm thinking it might in the long run create a different gold making opportunity .
how viable it would be is still to be seen but i 'm probably going to leave a few alts in these brackets just incase .
edit i am not saying that this will be anything drastic .
i just wanted to point out a possible change that current testing on the ptr has brought to my attention
could you add feature to backup and restore app setting like theme post preference subreddit preference etc ?

i 've recently upgraded to windows 10 and it feels great but when i pull up a stream on my second monitor while gaming on my main wow or something my main monitor jumps to 60hz for some reason i used to play windowed fullscreen 144hz on windows 7 and i could literally watch 3 streams at once on my second monitor while not dropping a single frame/screen being locked to 144hz on my main monitor but after upgrading to windows 10.. my shit has gone to literal shit !
i honestly dont know how to explain this it 's super hard..
windows 10 2 monitors stream on second while playing games such as wow windowed fullscreen forces my screen to 60hz .
windows 7 2 monitors stream on second while playing games such as wow windowed fullscreen 144hz at all times dont need to put vsync on .

1 week ago i was here losing the battle to ocd telling you all how this relapse was the cause of my demise and how i wanted to die but now all of a sudden none of that is there wtf !
sometimes when i feel that my ocd has entered a 'cooling off period ' it really has n't because i guess the overwhelming side effect and stress side effects are there still .
but in the past 48 hours i have felt no need to inspect '' my mind or even check for obsessions '' it is like my mind is completely focused on positive and better things ! !
and this often leads to the feeling of immunity however making mention of this to others will most likely trigger a relapse thus me eating my words and becoming a anhedonic depressed individual .

russia has rejected calls to cut ties with pyongyang and accused the united states of deliberately provoking north korean leader kim jong-un .
moscow said washington has been doing everything to prompt kim to quot lose it quot after it warned north korea 039 s leadership will be quot utterly destroyed quot if war breaks out .
the us also called on countries to cut all diplomatic and trade ties with north korea .
the latest threat came after north korea tested its third intercontinental ballistic missile which it claimed was capable of striking anywhere in the us .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov poured scorn on washington 039 s call to cut ties with north korea and introduce new sanctions against it .
mr lavrov pointed to washington 039 s plans to conduct a large-scale air force drill with south korea in december a new show of force aimed at the kim regime saying the us would be better off if it tried to hold negotiations instead .
quot the impression is that everything has been done to prompt kim jong-un to lose it and take another reckless step .
earlier this year the us pressed for a full oil embargo on north korea but dropped that demand following resistance from china and russia .

when i recently was playing operation breakout i saw one of my teammates just running to the bomb objective location and farming points from building and destroying walls .
he was sitting there making us get destroyed on first 2 objectives and ultimately loosing the game .
while being a total butthole he managed to be on top of the scoreboard while me and other teammates not only lost the game because of him but did n't even got close to the amount of points he got .
why there is n't the same barrier that kills you if you go the other way ?
as far as i know it can be done on other 2 maps as well .
this needs to be adressed because it 's only gon na get worse as more people gon na take advantage of it and ruin the game for others .

wondering if anyone has any information about this trail ?

if anyone can direct me to an official map or something that would be much appreciated !
and if anyone has done that hike would like to hear about your experience .
tl dr i like my new g6 but would like to install a theme from lg without changing the app icons .
i 've had my g6 for about a week now and am generally happy with it .
i came from two years with the nexus 6p and most thing seem like an upgrade .
i do miss stock android if nothing else because i ca n't disable all of the lg-apps i know i probably could with adb or by rooting or something but i have n't bothered .
nova launcher gives me a familiar look but i tried to install a theme from lg to change the colour of the menus and lg 's apps .
but the theme i find usable came with absolut horrid icons which clash with every non lg app icon .
if i could go back to the regular icons buy keep the theme i would be a lot happier .
i have tried to find a icon pack that had all my apps but it 's hard when i have some apps that are unusual or only used locally like swedish radio and tv .
other than that i 'm happy i really like the smaller screen compared to my old 6p .
but if someone has any tips or ideas for the icons that would be great .

anyways pm with a little about you and your situation and what you 're looking for on here if you 'd like to chat to me thanks
basically i 'm sitting in class while the professor is doing his job .
everyone is focusing on what he 's teaching and all of a sudden i feel a strong cough start to come up my throat .
i could 've just let it out but i instinctively closed my mouth for some reason and the cough was so strong i ended up spitting everywhere .
it was loud like when you 're trying to hold in a hard laugh and it burst out .
everyone australian friend who was laughing at me looked confused as shit .
i 've picked the game up for the first time in 3-4 years and i 'm enjoying the new additions steve walmsley has made up to 7.1 while we wait for c .
i 've also taken to judiciously editing the stevefire.mdb database to alter interrupts and other minor settings to make the game more pleasing to play .
one thing that 's always bugged me is the beam weapon fire control range limited at the distance light can travel in five seconds which is the smallest increment of game time .
this comes to roughly 1,440,000 km aka 5 light-second 5ls '' .
i 've googled extensively for other people who have attempted this and nobody has posted how they did it so i thought i would try to collect the information here for the community .
first we let 's clear up three common myths about the 5ls beam limit that have been around forever
it 's likely an editable feature in the database under the fire control range technologies in the researchcategories '' table or techsystems '' table in stevefire.mdb .
if beam fc range is greater than 5ls distance aurora will still resolve beamfire instantly in the fastest increment of five seconds .
from an rp standpoint it means your lasers railguns etc .
in a universe already containing tn elements wormholes space inertia etc .
it can easily be explained http aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php ? topic=6126.msg62787 msg62787 in rp terms
your beam fire control range is actually the maximum range that you can open a micro-wormhole to fire the laser through .
a nanosecond wormhole just big enough to fire the laser through is generated in the laser 's barrel '' with a terminus in a direct line to the target .
steve walmsley had two original rationales for instituting the 5ls limit
it made sense at the time to limit beam weapons by the speed of light .
he was concerned about combat balance specifically that engine tech might no longer matter in combat and would be overshadowed by increased beam fire range .
so has anybody here been successful in modifying their database to alter the beam fc range ?
if not let 's experiment with this on our own .
this is an amazing community and i 'm looking forward to all the insight and advice we can collect in one place on this .
welcome to our 36th better know a state bkas which will again focus on ohio .
as i indicated before the plan is to do these state-by-state highlighting upcoming elections progressive candidates in those states and major issues being fought with an emphasis on democratic independent and third party candidates .
state residents can let me know if i 've missed anything important or mistakenly described some of these issues .
as mentioned in the first ohio post ohio is a state where justice democrats and brandnew congress do not yet have any candidates .
however there may be some progressive candidates under consideration for justice dems or bnc .
reminder the deadline to file as a candidate for the 2018 races in ohio is february 7 2018 if running as a member of an established party or may 7 2018 if running as an independent candidate .
here are the filing requirements – link https www.sos.state.oh.us/globalassets/publications/election/2018_crg_07.pdf .
the date of the primary election in ohio is may 8 2018 .
in this first ohio post i described the u.s. senate race and the first 9 congressional districts .
in this second post i will discuss the remaining congressional districts and the governor 's race .
here 's what i 've found about the remaining races
oh-10 the incumbent is michael turner a republican with a very conservative voting record .
however he is one of only 20 republicans to vote no on repealing and replacing obamacare .
michael milisits is a technician for at t working to install digital tv high speed internet and voice services at people 's houses .
he is a member of the communications workers of america union note this is one of the unions that bernie supported when they had a strike against verizon – link http abcnews.go.com/politics/bernie-sanders-stands-verizon-workers-strike/story ? id=38367832 .
milisits supports single payer healthcare investing in renewable energy and fighting climate change spending on infrastructure keeping guns out of the hands of mentally unstable people separating investment and retail banking ending private prisons legalizing cannabis and hemp and campaign finance reform .
oh-11 the incumbent is marcia fudge a progressive democrat progressive punch crucial lifetime progressive score 91 and member of the house progressive caucus .
unfortunately she also has an association with one of the awan brothers imran awan .
james jerome bell does not seem to have a campaign website .
he also appears to be one of those perennial candidates because what little information i found about him online included that he has previously run for cleveland city councilman mayor of cleveland and president of the united states .
oh-12 the incumbent is pat tiberi a very conservative republican who voted to repeal and replace obamacare .
there are 2 republicans brandon grisez and carol o'brien and 3 democrats ed albertson john peters and doug wilson competing for his seat .
ed albertson is an employee of carew international where he is involved in training sales forces for the clients of carew .
he previously ran against pat tiberi in 2016 but lost .
he supports overturning citizens united ending gerrymandering automatic voter registration strengthening public schools a living wage but did n't define what that is – he also stated that minimum wage should be adjusted for regional differences spending on infrastructure and renewable energy simplifying the tax code closing tax loopholes and immigration reform .
on healthcare he says we should retain what works in the affordable care act and fix what doesn't but also states offering medicare for all would provide an already-working competitive alternative in the healthcare industry that would lower healthcare costs provide access and ease the pressures of health uncertainty for every one of us so it 's a little hard to know where he stands .
his website https www.johnpetersforthe12th.com does not have any details on the policies he supports .
doug wilson has served as mayor of the village of ashley he may still be but i could n't figure that out from his website .
he also previously served on the ashley village council .
in the past he has worked in healthcare as a respiratory care practitioner .
on healthcare he states first we need to work to solve the issues with the aca as we look to the future of healthcare in america .
we already have a very popular and effective care system in place that could be expanded to provide equal care for every man woman and child in our country .
medicare coverage for all is a plan that could serve us well and combining the taxes premiums paid by employees and employers for group insurance could curtail rising costs and provide equal treatment for all citizens .
we need to explore this option. he mentions the high costs of college and says we need to do something but does not give a proposed solution .

he wants to legalize marijuana and supports the 2nd amendment .
on military intervention he says he would forbid military intervention on foreign soil unless american lives are at stake and diplomacy is not an option .

mary taylor attorney general mike dewine u.s. rep. jim renacci and secretary of state jon husted one green party candidate constance gadell newton and one independent candidate collin hill .
i will describe the democrats green party candidate and independent here .
there has been some question https www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/30/justice-bill-oneill-violating-judicial-code-running-governor/814243001 about whether he is eligible to run for governor unless he resigns from his judgeship but as far as i know he has not yet resigned .
he was in the news because he recently posted on facebook a statement on which women he has slept with http www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article185271538.html i guess trying to avoid public scrutiny of his sexual exploits such as that affecting roy moore and other politicians and entertainers .
despite those controversies he actually has fairly progressive stances on the issues .
he is in favor of more spending on mental healthcare ending private prisons fighting the heroin crisis legalizing marijuana raising the minimum wage to 15/hr encouraging the production of solar panels in ohio reducing the cost of state universities in ohio by providing more state support for tuition and building a high-speed rail system in ohio .
connie pillich is an air force veteran a lawyer and a former ohio state representative .

i 'll just give a summary of some of the important points here but read the website if you want more details .
schiavoni supports protecting collective bargaining rights investing in infrastructure upgrades building green tech and emerging industries tax credits for small businesses that add new jobs raising the minimum wage but did n't say to how much ending tax credits to companies that ship jobs overseas charter school reform better public school funding providing more state support for public colleges and universities and more grants to students to help lower costs of college education etc .
on healthcare he wants to protect the medicaid expansion in ohio and support the aca .
he also says everyone deserves access to quality affordable healthcare .
joe encourages bills at the national level that move us in that direction including sen. sanders ' medicare for all bill and sen. sherrod brown 's bill to lower the eligibility age to 55 .
i really like his stances which seem very well-thought out and helpful to people .
betty sutton is a lawyer specializing in labor law the youngest woman ever to be elected to the ohio house of representatives and a former united state congresswoman .
here https www.bettysutton.com is her website but it has no details on her political positions .
as an ohio representative and us congresswoman she supported educational issues the aca and green energy development .
she has the endorsement http www.chroniclet.com/local-news/2017/09/04/rep-kaptur-backs-betty-sutton-for-governor.html of marcy kaptur .
here http nanwhaleyforohio.com is her webpage but it 's kind of skimpy on details of her policy positions .
she states ohio needs to get back to work .
we need to hold the drug companies that caused the heroin crisis accountable .
and we need our state to reestablish partnerships with our local communities again .
for the opioid crisis she has proposed to charge 5¢ per dose of narcotic drugs prescribed to pay for treatment of opioid abusers .

she has a reddit page dedicated to her r/constancegadellnewton although it is a very small subreddit .
her website https www.constanceforohio.com/home does n't really have an issues page with her political positions .
however some of the links there show she supports environmental causes greater mental health services higher wages more affordable housing and strengthening small businesses .
u zachmorris4187 suggested she would be willing to do an ama here on r/wayofthebern if we ask her .
he is a 22 year old still pursuing his undergraduate degree in college .
after that he has a rather complicated scheme to raise wages further at small businesses based on profits and reducing their income taxes but he does n't mention what would happen to wages at large profitable corporations like walmart .
he also supports more teacher autonomy in classrooms 2 years free community college or the same amount of dollars to attend a 4 year college legalization of marijuana and growing new industries in ohio .
in addition to the declared candidates there are a couple of additional people who have been rumored to be considering a run including the strong progressives dennis kucinich http www.toledoblade.com/keith-burris/2017/11/12/kucinich-i-know-why-trump-was-elected.html and richard cordray http www.toledoblade.com/state/2017/11/15/consumer-chief-resigning-expected-to-run-for-ohio-gov.html .
kucinich is a former mayor of cleveland former us representative from ohio and former candidate for president of the us in 2004 and 2008 .
he voted against going to war in iraq when he was in congress and voted against the patriot act .
in congress he also supported john conyers medicare-for-all bill .
he is against an interventionist foreign policy and advocates abolishing all nuclear weapons .
he opposes free trade agreements like nafta cafta and wto .
he is also a strong supporter of fighting climate change .
he supports a single-payer healthcare system legalizing marijuana and abolishing the death penalty .
richard cordray recently resigned as the first director of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb an agency established after wall street crashed the economy in 2008 which is designed to protect consumers from abuses by banks credit unions securities firms payday lenders mortgage-servicing operations foreclosure relief services debt collectors and other financial companies .
wall street and republicans hate the cfpb which is evident in this article http thehill.com/homenews/senate/361840-durbin-republicans-hate-cfpb-like-the-devil-hates-holy-water .
he would likely serve as a governor who fought for the common persons .
prior to directing the cfpb he had served at various times as ohio 's attorney general solicitor general and treasurer .
fun fact in 1987 he became an undefeated five-time jeopardy !
ohio residents have a plethora of great candidates running for governor .
in my mind joseph schiavoni constance gadell newton dennis kucinich and richard cordray are all great candidates .
and despite the controversies i think bill o'neill also has some good policies .
let me know in the comments if i 've missed any important candidates or issues .
in case you missed the previous bkas posts here they are

i have a group of friends/family that go camping each year .
in the past we 've just all gotten a few spots near each other in one of the many state parks usually mass .
last year we went to prospect mountain campground and booked one of their group fields which worked out really well .
the kids are also getting older so having planned activities at a private campground works out well .
we would really like to do group fields moving forward .
the problem is it 's really hard to find other camp grounds with group fields i 've found a handful but they 're for much larger groups and not very private .
most of us are in ct with one family in upstate ny near vt and one in ma near boston/ri .
we 've gone as far as bear mountain southern nh and emerald lake southern vt but we like to keep it near mass if possible .
anyone have any place they 've stayed at an liked ?

so i 'm relatively new to vaping and when i went to buy some higher nic juice last night the shop owner sold me some labeled 2.4 mg nicotine .
but he explained to me that it was 24 mg. now i 'm confused .
until i found myself not able to control it .
every day the urge and satisfaction from pulling out every single strands of hair on my head kept increasing .
but one day when i tried looking at myself in the mirror i saw bald patches scattered in different areas of my scalp .
but that fear is n't enough to kill this urge .
soon enough i can not go outside our house anymore .
few strands left on my head no more eyebrows and lashes .
no wonder why i became a laughing stock at school .
after few sessions of therapy and medicinal treatments somehow this uncontrollable habit subsided .
i tried building up my self-esteem again by going back to school and living a normal life .
everything went fine that day until a group of girls stopped me at the hallway .
not until you show us what 's under that shitty hat .
i hold tightly on my hat and said it 's nothing . ''
few seconds more she took my hat and raised it above my head .
they were all shocked to see my head with few hairs left .
i pushed her hard enough to bring her to the floor .
i went above her and gave a big slap on her face .
all the other girls are shouting like they 're enjoying the fight .
she shouted and struggled as we wrestle on the floor .
i got scared and ran away as fast as i could .
i went into one of the cubicles of the nearest comfort room i found .
while i gasped for some air i tried recalling what did just happen .
upon seeing it i figured out what i just did to her ...
big piles of her hair were in my hands with little bits of her skin and blood .
i expected to feel guilt with what i have done but i was wrong .
i never thought it 's much pleasurable and satisfying to pull out somebody else 's hair..

if i see a roach maker thing early i assume it 's the roach spitting bug all in i most likely have time to build defenses at my natural and ... well you guessed it i bunker up 2x siege my tanks here and hold at my natural .
if i see the flying building i 'll build turrets at my mineral lines as well as place widow mines but i can expand .
well i always shoo away or kill his scout probe before he decides to build in my bases corner if i see he started a pylon i wall off completly before doing my 2nd cc to prevent more tries .
if i see a forge and not much stuff in his base with my scout i assume it 's a cannon rush so i instantly send my reaper to find the probe and kill it then bunker up on the high ground and rush building tanks .
if i see a lot of warp gates i build 2 bunkers at my high ground ramp .
not much else i know here ... i die a lot to stalker blink in or dark templar do n't know how to spot yet .
no stuff in his base he is gon na proxy so i dont expand yet and double bunker ...
if i ca n't get into his base with my 17 scv i assume he is up to something shady and i build turrets at my mines in case of banshees .
that 's what i know with my limited experience .
basicaly if something is fishy i build my cc on high ground and not lift before i estabilished a defense at my natural and bunker up a lot ...
what other cheeses do i look out for and how to defend them ?

let 's check if the conservative and the other asshole sub is talking about this .
nope but they are making conspiracy theories about black people from other states voting in alabama .
so i guess they have their marching orders from the mercers .
they should be excluded because a bug in the game is what brought balance to the horrible game design of reboot .
just because something is a bug does n't mean it is unsatisfactory .
literally gunz the game was only good because of a playstyle that developed out of bugs and they decided that playstyle did n't need to be fixed .
at a point bug transcends its own nature and becomes a feature .
nexon should have been happy we were n't playing the game as it was unintended because frankly the way they were supposed to play caused kms reboot to die .
if not then i probably do n't agree with it lol .

that pre-fall sex was an instrumental activity according to some theologians as he does in the last sentence here .
and at least to my unrefined mind fist fucking as he explains it seems to be the closest we can come to that because it 's two conscious directed activities the movement of the fist and the anus in contrast to the standard erection of penis and ... what 's funny is that zizek mentions somewhere the idea that erection is a punishment for adam 's disobedience in effect its the fall which makes sex natural it 's not spontaneous .

i asked my mom what she wanted for christmas and then spouted off some ideas .
the suggestion came around when i clicked on a youtube video of a crochet pillowcase and i asked her if i could crochet her one .
she fucking loves decorative pillows and i have never had a chance to make a cover for one so i 'm gon na try and do that .
i 'm sure it 'll be fairly straightforward since i 'm more of an intermediate crocheter well beyond beginner .
i 've crocheted plenty of things and am now just getting into clothes .
if you have a skill where you can make them something that 'd be relatively straightforward i think that 's much better than just going out and buying something .
i stayed for a game this week where my team lost 401-0 .
it was an utter waste of my time and wholly un-enjoyable .

there are a lot more biracial jewish kids than you would first think .
there 's a whole parody song about black and jewish .
and you know a whole group of african jews in israel .
ok. let 's look at the math here first of all .
9.0 on the richter scale is n't just twice as bad as a 7.0 .
this animation just shows how far out the shaking from loma prieta went https escweb.wr.usgs.gov/content/learn/topics/shakingsimulations/1989/lp1989plan_hires.mp4
now you see the red parts of the animation ?
an earthquake on the magnitude of the chile quake happening in place of the 6.9 at loma prieta would spread those red spots for miles all around .
there were 63 deaths reported from the earthquake with most of those deaths coming as a result of the cypress viaduct collapse .
in addition to this according to usgs sixteen thousand homes were uninhabitable .
with the damage from a 9.0 you 'd be looking an exponentially higher number of both casualties and destroyed buildings and not just during the main quake .
a quake of that magnitude would have a chain of smaller quakes before and after it .
then you 'd have the potential for a tsunami .
a quake of big one proportions in california would put pretty much every location within the ring of fire at elevated risk for a tsunami .
we 're talking everything from alaska down to new zealand .
a tsunami is not a great wave off kanagawa thing .
it 's the base of the ocean rising up and the water displaced moving inland at a rapid rate .
bascially and to put it let scientifically if the loma prieta earthquake had been a 9.0 california and most of the western seaboard would be screwed three ways .
anywhere that actually got hit by a loma prieta tsunami would likely still have been rebuilding by the time of the kobe earthquake in 1995 .
the loss of life and livelihood from an earthquake of this magnitude would be almost incalculable .

the general mathematical technique is to start with a description of your problem a description of your goal or how you know you 've solved the problem a description of your initial information .
then figure out how to subdivide the path from the things you already have to the things you need into a path through something you need but do n't have but might be able to get can use to reach your goal starting by reducing the descriptions to formalism or things that have mathematical meaning .
for anything vague or undefined look up the definition unless the real problem is figuring out what you mean and coming up with a definition .
keep track of how you 're transforming definitions making inferences .
the first step in formalizing things to the point where you can start writing code is to figure out the types of everything involved .
the problem right now is you do n't know the type of thing you 're being asked to do .
working out the types on paper means they do n't have to exist in the haskell type system so you can write types like a number k such that k 20 k 22 '' and length-5 list '' after the fact replace types you ca n't express with means of generating values that enforce their interpretation as things with the required properties or at least that give error messages when they do n't .
hole-driven development helps codify how that organizes into an implementation
t is the transpose its type here is effectively n-dimensional column vector n-dimensional row vector .
you can use type definitions to organize the different roles of row column in the expression .
row and column vectors are treated as matrices for the purpose of multiplying a column vector-row vector pair .
those holes can then be replaced with implementations using terms that have holes in their own definitions .
this means that the problem has been subdivided into a new need to fill the holes and what you know about the problem the typing of expressions plus the inputs x h n .

ah puch the problem here is that while he is bad for conquest he is very good or even op in others game modes .
ah puch 's nerf was the last case of a balance change made that was not for conquest at lest the last one that hirez said that was not for conquest .
the only way to make ah puch good for conquest would probally a rework .
loki basically the same case of ah puch while he is bad for conquest he is really strong in others game modes with the difference that loki is one of the biggest pubstompers in the game so in low rank conquest he is still good .
also reworking in this case just a rework to his ult but the point is still the same one of the most popular gods in the game is not a good idea .
basically the thing with those two gods is that they are great in outside of conquest and they ca n't be buffed to the point where they would be good for conquest without being the most op gods and maybe pick to win in the others game modes .
but let 's be honest we do n't need everyone being equally viable in every game mode and in every level of play .
is there a subreddit for them ideally of just electronics ?
wow can you give advice on how to apply for a scholarship in up masters of stat ?
yeah this is the only time i 've ever related to her tbh
what happens to me is i 'll wake up and not know where i am where the front door is or how the room is laid out .
just have to get oriented then i 'm good .
at the time i was super intimidated because i was literally just starting .
like j had a guitar for three month before and i was n't getting any better .
and also playing everything by led zeppelin shortly after .
and then the best was getting into phish and jam bands and jamming with people or a looper pedal for hours everyday .
except all of those games sans medal of honor and burnout have an iteration on this gen of consoles so..wtf ?
he admitted to firing a gun not at her .
well shit next time i shoot and kill someone i 'll be sure to tell the cops that i accidentally fired the gun and they 'll no biggy and let me go .
might want to check your hands i think you have some blood on them .
when i was about 12-14 i had a few paranormal experiences in the house we lived in for that period of time .
on the estate we lived on my mum and her partner of the time lived in two separate council houses across from each other .
as the eldest of my siblings i was usually the one sent to run between the houses to fetch things or relay messages especially after night .
my first 'experience ' was one such night where all of my family were at one house mostly asleep as it was late at night and i was sent across to go sleep in my own bed by myself as there was no more room at the other house .
on my way over to the house i strangely felt a feeling of dread which did n't happen often as i make errands between the houses constantly and i was long used to it by then .
i felt as though something were following me and if i turned around i would see something there so i determinedly just marched onward to my house nearly jogging in my nervousness .
when i got to the house and closed the door after me i bent down to untie my shoes .
when i did i heard and felt a dog panting down my neck .
my first reaction that it was our dog ben but i quickly registered that the door was directly behind me so there would be no space for a dog and when i looked up i found ben staring directly at me with his hackles raised and quietly growling .
when i turned around the sensation stopped and there was nothing there .
it still gives me shivers now as i remember i very vividly felt the hot breath of a panting dog rush down my neck too realistic to have been imagined .
my second experience was with what i believe to be the same dog .
it was a similar situation as i was in the same house late by myself with everyone over at the other house .
i was sitting in the kitchen drawing at the table with only light on in the whole house being the kitchen light overhead of me .
i find drawing cathartic and i had gotten to a rare state of mind where reality did n't seem to exist because i was that lost in the drawing .
and then i very clearly remember hearing a quiet and echoey 'vwoosh ' sound just as the figure of a black dog appeared in the corner of my eye .
the figure was completely stiff and hovered from one end of the room to the other without making any movements of walking or moving at all .
after the figure disappeared it took my mind a good few seconds to catch up with what had just happened being in the far-away state it was at which point i gathered my stuff and legged it over to the other house .
after that encounter my mum brought a psychic into the house as her and her partner had also heard strange things .
the most noteworthy that she told me was when we had all been in the house with all the kids asleep on the couch 's and floor after having watched a movie with only her and her partner awake .
they had heard noises from the room directly above them that sounded like furniture being moved and things being thrown about but when they went up to investigate they found nothing had been touched and there was no one up there .
the psychic that came to our house said that there was a boy in our house that was stuck but he liked dogs so the psychic had found a dog for him to 'go into the light ' with .
after that all of the strange occurrences in the house stopped .
the last experience was not in any houses but still in the surrounding area of where we lived at the time .
me my sister and my friend from next door had decided to go on a walk up the hill directly opposite the estate .
this was nothing new or out of the ordinary we went on walks like this daily most of the time going allot further than just the hill .
that day however as we were walking up the path leading through a small woodland towards the top of the hill we all inexplicably started to feel something akin to a nervous dread .
we all felt on edge and afraid of what we had no idea .
the wind had been particularly strong that day which was nothing new but somehow it had seemed threatening .
we all felt a large sense of foreboding for whatever was at the top of the hill which was incredibly weird as at the top of that hill was a landmark that we affectionately called 'the horseshoe ' and was our most common meet up where we would spend most of our time relaxing .
the closer we got to the horseshoe the more jumpy and fearful we became .
we had no idea what was happening or why we felt so afraid .
and i remember just as we got to the edge of the horseshoe the formation just in sight i got a sudden rush of urgency .
without any kind of prompt i turned away and instantly began running down the hill my sister and friend had acted the exact same way at the exact same time .
i remember looking back up the hill and seeing a tall dark blurry and shapeless figure darting at inhuman speeds across the field towards us my friend would later tell me she saw a similar thing .
i turned my head back to keep running the sense of fear renewed but when i looked back again it was gone .
when we got back to the bottom of the hill we all agreed that what had happened was terrifying and not normal and as we recounted it we realised that the moment of urgency we all felt happened at exactly the same time with no prompt and we all turned to run individual to each other for no apparent reason .
the day after that we went back up there and felt completely normal just like all our other days and nothing like that ever happened again .
i have never felt any kind of apprehension or fear of the place since and it remained to be one of our favourite places to hang despite what had happened there .
i know that there is a history of paranormal activity on my dad 's side of the family namely from one farm they used to live on but those stories are many and are not mine .
though it may have contributed to my sensitivity to what was happening in that old home .
this kind of thinking is why the first destiny was so bad .
they went for the illusion of choice over a good story and just ended up with a terrible story campaign that was also still pretty transparently linear since the order you did the missions in did n't actually affect anything .
you would think that as a leafs fan you would know by now to avoid planning the parade until you 've actually won

but he ca n't call himself a hip hop artist after shitting on hip hop and stressing for so long that he wants to make other music .
it 's a phony little backtrack and he 's profiting off a genre he only wants to claim now that his back is to the wall .
also he 's guilty of the exact same criticisms he himself had of hip hop .
so no he does not have to be a prototypical hip hop head .
but yes he owes hip hop respect if he 's gon na claim he makes it and keep making money off of it .
when i was super depressed and suicidal i would pop 1mg of ativan and it would make me feel much better .
failure is best described as giving up on hope and dreams .
i 'll just say shortly about 7 years ago i was in a near fatal car accident .
i was told i would probably not walk again .
here i am i 'm alive and can walk just fine .
well fast forward to now and everyday i am training to run a half marathon .
and in one or two years i will run walk crawl or do whatever it takes to complete the boston marathon .
i wish you the best in all your efforts .
ea is just salty that they ca n't make a game that people do n't shit on
i 'm actually a bit proud of that mix up .
pssht we 've moved on to flat caps bow ties and sleeve tattoos .

i do n't see where you get i should n't have to buy every aspect of the game i already paid for and which is already on the disc as entitled .
yeah i may have paid for my chicken wings but that does n't mean i 'm entitled to them being cooked or having wing sauce on them .
i should be happy the wonderful buffalo wild wings allowed me to purchase chicken that i can eat raw and if i do n't want to eat it raw or pay extra for them to cook it and sauce it well i 'm free to go to a restaurant that is n't trying to poison me with uncooked chicken .
sorry must have been an auto correct thing i missed .
this sounds exactly like my story and we have the same stats .
i wish i had some advice but i 'm honestly in the same place as you are right now please let us know if you get any advice that helps i 've been trying to figure this out for awhile now .

even the cashier tried to convince her but she was n't having it .
i even called the store manager and told her what was going on in front of the customer and she said if it 's not in our system it 's not ours '' .
customer just doubled down harder she was 100 sure she bought it at our store on this day from this person ... ... that did n't even work at our store .

this is secondhand but my sister has multiple invisible issues autism ocd psychosis and it 's very difficult for her because she has a very low iq but looks like any normal teenager her age .
people often do n't take her disabilities seriously because she looks normal .
i wish people understood that just because they ca n't see the issue it does n't mean it 's not there .
people have called her rude disrespectful etc because she struggles to carry on conversations or greet new people .
just wish the world could understand her beautiful soul a little better

my back/hip pain is upsetting me especially because i have to wait longer to try to solve it .
there 's not enough money to buy the stuff i need yet .
it always amazed me how deep the lore of that game is .
every time i go back i somehow manage to find a little more detail a little more characterization and development .
just recently on a whim i decided to visit seles before i believe the raid on hellena to save albert ... . and lo and behold you can meet shana 's parents .
they have a short conversation where they thank dart for saving her and telling her they support her decision to travel with him and to come home safe .
i 'd played this game so many times over and never knew this was in the game .
there are way worse problems with rogue one than anything to do with nostalgia like basic script structure there 's absolutely no reason for the digression to the rainy imperial research planet in the second act other than to have the characters visit a place that is n't jedha or scarif characterization and the whole ending where the super-sad ending with all of the heroes being wiped out being immediately followed with a completely random scene designed to get the audience suddenly cheering for the bad guys as vader chops up a dozen innocent good guys .
that sucks since i really loved to see the activity feed of everyone .
elders barely use any hp pots not too many mp pots and are the best sustained healers .
they hit hard enough to solo grind for most of the game and are always wanted in parties .
my tip would be to just do everything available and you will progress get a lot of stuff naturally .

i have a different opinion to you but 1 for adding to the conversation .
although the early game lacked movement abilities the ambiance was engrossing enough that the exploration was still fun .
and while i agree that the map system makes no logical sense why ca n't i sketch the areas that i 've actually visited i think it creates a sense of danger whenever you venture into a new area which works in the game 's favor .
i do wish that all the vendors would have eventually relocated to the town .
well it takes a lot to come back from that .
joining openxr is the most significant thing they have done however it remains to be seen if they joined that purely out of self interest or they actually plan on supporting other devices .

it 's not everyone but it 's a majority that believe in god to get them and keep them sober .
and god is the steps and the fellowship and abstinence by the way .
in no way am i hating because i fucking wish i could do it their way .
what i have liked is listening to other people talk about their experiences with drinking .

i 'm actually wondering about the name thing in all seriousness because in s1e1 elliot goes out of his way to point out that michael hansen is n't the real name of lenny shannon and then we find out what a ghost elliot is online .
just one of my hundreds of ponderings on all the stuff that is possible on this show ... .
ca n't be too much of a surprise that it comes from those who benefit most from their association with it ...
and listen to the grumbling of the pcbeggerrace for months to come ?
yeah totally i am using that typed the wrong number while posting .
most rangers around here florida are driven by pool guys and pressure washers .
i have a ranger myself but i just use it for home depot runs and much .
i also like that is n't some giant wasteful dick-extending monster truck .
it 's just a humble little work truck that does it 's job .
and you 're getting totems from slayer so it 's just a waste not to use them .
is this a joke i do n't remember a bridge in green light
i do n't agree with jagex at all in their policy towards username trading .
you should n't be able to trade usernames and it should be a bannable offense whether you except gold items or real currency .
it 's a shame regular players have a hard time getting them because they 're grabbed up like ticket master will buy out all the tickets to the concert before the regular users get a chance and then they sell them at a high premium .
i am pretty sure many ppl here who we expected to be pakistanis gave away little things and later were found to be indians .
possibly i checked that on mine last night i 've never used the xbox live thing and neither does he and mine was automatically set to off but i 'll get him to double check
it 's the first day of winter which means it 's time for yet another update !
to tell you the truth they the updates do n't always come easy to us especially now when the project is in the stage of development that does n't exactly allow for any groundbreaking announcements .
many of you already know that instead of this year as we initially planned love money rock'n'roll will see the light in 2018 .
to be honest we do n't want to beat the wind and come up with excuses game development is a hard creative process its exact measurements are useless etc .
we are determined to see it to the end .
recently we have held a voting in our vk community to find out if the fans would like to see a new demo version something closer to the one we 're preparing for the first backer release that would demonstrate — better than any numbers — the fruits of our labor .
the results turned out to be quite interesting so we just may treat you guys with a gift for the new year !
as for the details of the progress we have made great improvements to the mobile versions everything works fine at first approximation and we have started the initial testing process .
the final number of cgs has somewhat exceeded one hundred and do n't forget a single cg can have 2-5 variations that can take up to a third of any given picture but about 90 of them already have the lineart and a bit fewer have been completely colored .
additionally at the moment we are finishing the animations for the main heroines ' sprites several new poses and clothes for them .
the game can be supported financially at the old address https www.indiegogo.com/projects/love-money-rock-n-roll-animation .
the new stretch goal is just around the corner !

if everyone believes the big n are the best companies to work for then everyone will apply then the big n will take the top people
this assumes that the big n '' can reliably identify the top people '' .
i think that they are very good at identifying a certain type of engineer but i do n't think it covers the whole range of what makes top engineering talent .
in any case they do get the first pick of their preferred type .
this is just based on what i heard from their interviews and reading on here i 've never worked nor applied there so that it with a grain of salt .
i 'm also not saying that there are n't some of the best software engineers working there .
especially the part where its our fault this game is still broken because we learn to shrug off errors and rollback as 'normal ark behaviour ' .
thats ridiculous about you being banned twice and i almost wish i didnt hear that ... did they send you any sort of email regarding that ?
when people ask me how ark is i now tell them its the best worst game ive ever played '' .
because i also have spend more time than any other game in ark .
but thats the only way to enjoy the game you cant learn it in one day .
ive made 10 's of characters reach level 100 and still learn new facts about the game daily .
but everything you mentioned in the vid has to be fixed if im gon na pursue dlc .
cuz as it stands ive had the ark experience ive raised all the dinos .
because its an awesome game with huge potential that like you said just needs polishing .
i dont know how they will fix the server nonsense that being said im not a developer but its like the system they developed is so tainted they will have to tear down and completely rebuild .
if you know someone in ktm and is willing to help you he can go the bank with your passports 's copy ets ' username fill the form up and you are good to go .
i 'm sure it 's fine the english cricket team have been sledging themselves for a week already
yeah but battlefront was not a free to play game ...
i just woke up still in bed and this freaked me out .
in 40k they use either the target 's s or t to wound whichever is better but that felt like a pretty meh thing for necromunda .
i think a web gun fired with sufficent force could still break a bone as well as strangle a person even if it is unlikely .
i 'm not quite happy with the web rules but i felt it was best to do something with them for now .
they probably should be changed to auto or 2 as the web condition is pretty weak at the moment as it only loses you one or two actions compare to blaze which will usually lose you two actions and has the capability of doing more damage .
the capture thing did cross my mind but i think it would be quite a lot of rules to write to balance with that .
the thought with the claws is that they are similar they are n't the crazy different talons that appear in tyranids or late stage metamorphs was thinking of adding a metamorph skill '' list but i omitted that for now but just normal mutated claws .
well there is the power weapon '' but i guess that is pretty clearly a sword since it has the same stats as the power sword .
the power pick would probably just be the same as a power hammer .
i decided not to include any non-new weapons for now though .
that 's a cynical take simply because i 've been in all variations of the poly community my whole life .
the struggle with poly is that there are hidden agendas and forced agreements ... . there 's always one with an upper hand and clearer assessment of what is going on .
in the end poly works out as long as it works out .
i would love to see the retention rate of poly or open couples over time .
there 's just so many variables brought into existence that are n't usually discussed by relatively immature couples into passionate exploration .
in threadripper there are two dies each configured with one pcie x16 one pcie x8 and at least one nvme .
typically one of the dies are connected to a chipset that provides additional functionality like network .
this depends on how the pci-e lanes are connected on the motherboard .
on zenith extreme it 's different as shown here http pclab.pl/zdjecia/artykuly/mbrzostek/amd_zen/threadripper/tech/zenith_pcie.jpg
i would make an ebay mystery box like this https youtu.be/thup8jtej9q why not ?
at least you don‘t need to pay the postage .
i would check on drugs.com and make sure that they are in fact the drug they gave you .
the problem with displaying arbitrary high-density content like a map in this area is that the status bar can easily become hard to read https i.imgur.com/hqebart.png hence the blurring .
we should be careful not to fall into the trap of dressing for compliments when you do n't get receive affirmation on a fit that you think is great and become overly self critical and devalue your self worth based on not getting a pat on the back from a stranger .
but when it 's someone you know it 's different .
when someone in your life do n't care it is very easy for them to do so unless you think that streetwear could help their mind do n't waist your time trying to explain to them a vision you know you will never eye to eye on .
streetwear is one of our arts it 's about self expression .
do n't let others tell you that only one kind of art is good or that your specific art is bad .
i always thought it was a knot '' at the base of the penis like with a dog 's penis .
thanks very much and yeah this is ftb infinity evolved .
and how does changing the japanese constitution help with any of that ?
ravana is the only god who has a punching style kit merc is too fast and terra is an earth bender .
ravana has no skins so i say they should just go crazy with ideas make him the new nu wa .
you can also get a national express coach card for £10 .
the aviemore branch was only built about six years ago before that we had a mobile one .
yeah the syrians never massacred any lebanese and there was no opposition to the syrian occupation .
giving hybrid spells the color identity rules change does not affect phyrexian mana spells at all .
pay 2 life '' is not a color identity .
you ca n't honestly expect a dude to ask a team of experts to look at every single sentence he says .
absolutely you fucking can especially when you 're screaming it yo the world .
what 3 should i get from my ticket tomorrow ?
my main team is epis has uw morrah maria and frey .
i think i prolly needs some pdps since chapter 5 is kind of a struggle .
what would be the police response for a foreign passport being taken ?
i 'm american and german but i 'm legit fucking german .
my mom lived there practically her whole life i grew up speaking german i 'm a citizen of both countries etc ...
it just annoys me when people think that they have as close of a connection to the country as i do because one of their great great great grandparents emigrated from there .
as most m'tippers such as myself would understand and appreciate .
to confirm i do n't want the literal names of those seven characters .
i would say yes but if you can run master without her wait to see if you drop her .
if you did not by the end of the event go wild .
snow white ab does not benefit much from lb anyway .
i got a 500 spm on tdm ... what was that about not gettin spm from kills ?
or is there a hidden objective in tdm i 've been playing ?
day 8 start of a new week of my diet start of a new month !
i pledge to eat between 1200-1400 today walk a leg of my commute both ways and do an exercise video .
i went a little over yesterday and did n't do a video but i did get a new couch and spent a lot of time moving stuff disassembling assembling and hauling stuff out to the garbage area .
so i think i 'm good on the physical activity and calories .
you 're thinking of tbc when fol was boss and rewarded 100 mana back on crit

as long as the conflict in ukraine is not resolved they are not allowed to join nato so putin at least gained that in addition to crimea .
even if the situation is a money drain it still serves a purpose .
the sanctions for crimea will be lifted some day without russia returning it .
it might take a decade but at some point even the us will realize that crimea is gone for good .
in syria russia has gained international prestige for succesfully standing with its ally .
the syrian state will continue to exist and with it russia 's naval base in tartus .
so overall i would say that putin was quite successfull in stopping the us advance into russia-affiliated spaces .
ah the best kind of counter points claiming someone who disagrees with you a child .
for me it 's the random fps drops that are annoying i have a decent '' pc and can run the game 100+fps even with ground effects but when you 're fighting some strong map boss and game decides it 's time to run at 2fps it 's not fine ...
i 've been looking at the fat head dough .
my biggest thing is i like mashed potatoes mac n cheese etc .
alot so i was just wandering if anyone knew an alternative to making those things from cauliflower .
anyway lol nice to know i 'm not the only one .
have noticed the same on my iphone since the update .
could reach a gym from my home earlier now i ca n't .
but i can still reach it with my samsung-phone with android so it 's not all bad .
choose one that fits you best then upgrade it as much as possible .
i go with the bear school gear like most of us do but there are many players who use cat school too .
i believe you can find the required player levels for each witcher gear set on wikia or ign .

just another report from a moderately heavy user with normal labs .
my liver numbers were of special interest to me after reading various posts of concern on kratom 's liver effects but i can join in with the rest and say i am as healthy as ever actually my numbers went down not up !
i probably take 20g a day depends on the day but i 'm a daily user and have been for 1.5 years and a sometimes user before that chronic pain and wanting to avoid opiates like many .
other numbers were all normal too excepting a couple that have to do with other areas that are not remotely related to kratom .
when i compared these labs with labs done in october 2013 i found my numbers have gone down .
my ast was 18 and my alt was 15 .
the difference is that 4 years ago i only had opiates to manage my pain .
incidentally almost all my labs are better now than they were 4 years ago and few other things have changed in my life except maybe my diet is a bit worse too much sugar ! .
i am an active professional and exercise daily none of which has changed in 4 years .
obviously correlation does n't equal causation but clearly my kratom use has not hurt my health that much i can conclude .
i 'm curious what has caused people in your questing groups to fight each other whether it be valuable items or differing ideals and how did it end up
when i say fighting i mean pc fighting each other causing physical damage
i have read about many individual police chiefs coming out as opposed to reciprocity and more legally armed citizens .
i know many chiefs are politically appointed positions and beholden to whomever appointed them so i was wondering if this actually reflected the opinions of the average officer on the street as well .
if you 're reading this it 's because you accessed the internet .
right now you are receiving information from sources outside of your current experiential awareness by way of the internet .
information is limitless and one search can bring up thousands upon thousands of search results .
millions of philosophical musical artistic pornographic and entertaining ideas represented through pictures and videos of people from all walks of life from every background age gender religion race are found splattered all across the internet .
if we want to know something or experience second-hand what transpired in the infinite possibilities of life which someone happened to record or transcribe we simply manifest this intent by googling and seeing what shows up .
everything will show up the good the bad the useful the useless the funny the scary the loving the blasphemous including results that will create emotional charges of love hate fear excitement doubt and compassion .
in short access to the internet gives us a wealth of knowledge and information including the stirring of our emotions .
for the added benefit of this sub nofappers fappers dopaminers and sr'ners of varying practices all have access to the internet .
there is a lot of parallel between the internet and the inner-net .
the inner-net is the spiritual side of the internet .
the internet pales in comparison to the infiniteness that is contained in the inner-net .
to start everything on the internet is contained in the inner-net and everything that happened before during and after what the internet captures is stored in the inner-net .
all actions thoughts experiences lives past/present/future details of anything and anyone imagined are all potentially accessible with access to the inner-net .
the thing is that we all have access to the inner-net but the vast majority is clueless that it even exists because of their incessant fixation on physical nature and their physical sense of existence .
however we on the sr sub have a clue and have been given other clues also .
one of the benefits of semen retention is breaking away from the crowd that would keep us from evolving to our highest spiritual potential .
sr has its physical benefits but the major benefits are spiritual .
the practice often goes hand-in-hand with pranayama meditation https gnosticteachings.org/introductory-information/44-meditation-the-science-of-awakening.html kundalini awakening ego death and psychic awareness .
these phenomena arise from constantly looking within '' becoming acquainted with emptiness being in the world but not of the world trusting in a process bigger than ourselves and staying in tune with our natural inner urgings .
it is in this blank state that we can access the inner-net of everything-yet .
everyone with an outer connection can access the internet and everyone with an inner connection can access the inner-net .
before the internet someone went through trail and error to create the foundation that once implemented would change the lives of millions .
before the inner-net someone will have to go through trial and error of life changes to create the foundation necessary for inner revelation .
the practice of emptiness or from another perspective wholeness is our access point to the universal inner-net .
once fully connected within all it takes it intent practice and receptivity to benefit from the inner-net .
to repeat with a slight trick of words nofappers fappers dopaminers and sr'ners of varying practices all have access to the inner-net .
beholding things people and life in other perspectives often bring less separation and more unification less piercing judgement and more unconditional love .
really we already access the inner-net we 're just limited to our personal history and memory downloads .
when i type my posts i put forth the intention to be helpful informative and creative if not poetic using my personal past experience .
from a quiet mind i sit and allow thoughts to come then type then feel the vibes that it gives then reword rearrange sentences delete parts reread this and that ... but the whole ordeal is contained within my personal thoughts and experiences .
with continual practice which can be seen from my post history for the first time i accessed the inner-net for information outside of my limited awareness .
yesterday evening i did an exercise where i set the intent to receive one word that would relate to something meaningful which would happen within the next 6 hours .
i blanked my mind and trusted the first thought that popped up .
a few minutes later it dawned on me that i would be eating mashed potatoes for dinner .
the next morning i sat for 5 minutes with a quiet mind then did the same intention .
i received some thoughts but i knew they were mine so i became silent again .
after a few seconds the word buddy '' popped up .
i thought after all these years at work am i finally going to get a buddy who i can relate with and be friends not acquaintances with ?
that did n't happen but as soon as i got to work i opened my email and saw a company-spam '' elf on the shelf '' crap email for employees to find it somewhere in the building and take a selfie with it .
i did n't read the message but happened to scroll all the way down and to my surprise it was signed xoxo buddy '' what a shock !
i say all this to encourage and motivate those that share a resonance with my thoughtful and heart-felt contributions .
keep at it wherever you are and whatever you do .
do n't listen to the naysayers be a creator of your own life all while in sync with universal life .
you are the reason for the semen and the retainment thereof .
let us acknowledge our access to the inner-net and practice with intent to use it the same way we would use the internet .
but rather than us using the internet life itself through the inner-net will use us once we become empty and willing vessels .
a few great masters come to mind ... and a few on this sub are in the works .

so i am sort of familiar with reddit and all it 's glory and basically i have noticed that the community here is pretty awesome .
long story short my close friend and i have started a podcast that we are really proud of called thousand mile hug and we wanted to see how it would be received here on reddit .
we both believe word of mouth grassroots sort of growth is better than sprouting up too quick and being killed by the sun..but a lot of posting guidelines for various subreddits do n't allow self promotion ... totally fair i understand why that is ...
my question is basically this is there a cool way to ask a few new potential friends to listen to a new podcast and provide feedback or share it or whatever without it being self promotion or anything along those lines ?
i 'm one of the co-hosts of thousand mile hug and i 'll gladly abide by the redditor rules and culture .
we 're just 2 creators who want to share our creation and maybe even hear about other creators ' creations ... any feedback is appreciated .
i found a 7 pod aerogarden at a local thrift store for 10 .

i 'm using the pricing available in my country here cuz shipping and import fees are insane in norway .
i want a 27 '' 144hz 1ms 1440p monitor with either g-sync or freesync .
with this in mind i 'd like to run my games on 144fps at least bf1 witcher 3 cs go and future titles
keep in mind not all monitors are available in norway so if i wanted say the dell s2716dg with g-sync i 'd have to drive to sweden and then pay 760 instead of the 500 listed on amazon ...
amazon 500 shipping fees and import fees come up as 771 .
a complicated issue because i 've already bought a xg270hu freesync on black friday for 470 which is an insane deal
the cheapest available g-sync monitor with similar specs i could find was the xb271hu for 900 !
as far as benchmarks go the vega 64 lc and the 1080 go hand in hand .
if i wanted freesync the vega lc and monitor combined cost me about 1350
if i wanted g-sync the 1080 and monitor would be about 1540
this is insane speculation of numbers of course but hell i want the best i can get for my money .
or should i actually go for the vega or maybe i should just opt for the 1080ti and ignore any sync for now .
another complication my motherboard does n't support sli and vega 64 lc does n't seem like crossfire will be supported ... so in 4-5 years i 'll probably have to switch it all out again ...
yet another complication i already have liquid cooling in my case so would adding another radiator block airflow in my case ?

after a game of doing item cdr sion using domination primary and inspiration secondary i do n't like the zz banner locket etc with ruby sight stone as much as any other rune .
i 'd say i like using aftershock better lol .
just my preference how do you guys feel about item cdr sion ?
it was extremely easy to get first tower as mid sion and go top and get top tower too since the patch makes minions do more damage to towers too
after finishing talon of horus and black legion a couple of points made me think about the nature of daemons in the warp .
familiars i remember in a thousand sons there was barely any mention of familiars .
and yet iskandar khayon had one that was extremely loyal gyre and so did his mentor .
was this an oversight by the previous author or was this something just retconned or added as another feature unique to the thousand sons sorcerers ?
the ragged knight was a daemon born from the deaths that occurred during the albigensian crusade a real life historical event .
another well-known daemon drach'nyen or the end of empires materialized from the first murder implied to be the biblical cain and abel .
are there any other daemons that were created from real life historical or religious or mythological events ?
was there a daemon that was created due to the holocaust or stalin 's purges or the deaths in the trenches of world war 1 ?
in master of mankind the emperor used the custodes ra to trap the demon drach'nyen end of empires the first murder .
the daemon was trapped as a sword inside of ra and he was told by the emperor to keep running .
in black legion we find out that abaddon was searching for drach'nyen in order to become warmaster .
he of course would find it and the rest is history .
thing is has there ever been any additional story/lore about ra ?
he just kept running in the webway during the horus heresy but no mention of what happened and how drach'nyen was simply left in a planet a few hundred years later for abaddon to claim .
for those of you unfamiliar with stand saturday it 's a weekly game where we each create our own stands .
a stand is essentially the personification of one 's willpower which is the power that replaced the ripple hamon starting in part 3 of jojo .
each stand 's ability is completely different to an extent from everyone else 's and really depends on your creativity on how to use it .
in addition to stand abilities each stand has its own stats which represents its effectiveness these are power speed range durability precision and development potential .
this week 's theme is from u/mauserratte time periods .
create a stand around an era in time victorian stands/stand users 1930 's gangster stands you name it !
my girlfriend has a drinking problem and it 's been getting worse and worse .
i feel so tired in her presence when she 's drinking because i know where the night is heading and she 's drinking almost every night of the week .
she 'll usually start off happy but then she 'll get drunk and become nasty and argumentative with me for no reason .
i 've been trying not to engage but she 'll start accuse me of all types of things cheating hating her etc ... none of which i do or would ever do .
then i 'm told that i should go f*ck an ex and try not to cheat on me tonight '' .
none of it really makes sense and it 's out of the blue .
she 'll say things like how i do n't understand her as a person i do n't drink myself .
i really think she simply views me as someone who gets in the way of her drinking .
i want to attend a meeting but the ones near me conflict with my work schedule .
i 'm considering doing a phone one if she 's not around .
i know i sound methodical and robotic in this but that 's because i 've shut my emotions .
honestly i 'm completely eaten up on the inside i know i ca n't control it cause it or stop it but i do n't know what to do .
i love her and i have this hope she 'll return to herself .
i mean that literally she 'll stop hanging out and demand to be dropped off back home she thinks i do n't know it 's because she has alcohol there .
i 'm sick of the lying the pissed beds the accusations the constant guilting me for my exes exhaustion the constant worrying the belligerence .
and then the sober apologies how sorry she is and yet will have another drink the same day .
we 're supposed to travel together during and i almost do n't even want to go with her because i know it 's going to devolve into her being belligerent and me having to worry if she 'll piss the hotel room .
i love her but i do n't know what to do anymore .
i took my 2 yr old maltese 7 lbs to the vet around 5pm this evening it is now 3am .
hey gave him fluids and medicine for nausea and sent me home with 2 medicines metronidazole and diawin .
he is still having terrible diarrhea and now there is blood both in the stool and all over his rectal area .
do i need to take him to the emergency vet or stay up with him all night and go in the morning ?
i plan on calling them at 8 am when they open but am concerned that symptoms have not subsided and blood has now come into the picture .
i 've been working on and off on a little voxel game project of mine and i 've come to a problem .
i 've implemented triplanar texturing with marching cubes in unity with a shader that takes a texture2darray of textures and displays them on the terrain .
however for now i can only choose one texture at a time which covers all the voxels and i 'm stumped about how to tell the different textures to go on their block ids as in i do n't know how to get that information from the chunk class to the shader .
basically the way it works is like so when the program starts it combines all the textures into one texture array .
then it sets the diffuse texture in the shader to that texture array .
now i choose the id of the texture that i want displayed over all the terrain .
i want to send my block ids from the chunk to the shader so that i can choose the correct texture to display over that block 's domain but i do n't know how to .
i started by trying to send the entire 3d voxel id array to the shader as a uniform variable but then realized that you can only send 1d arrays and that there must be a more practical solution .
i was also thinking about sending the block ids as vertex attributes but i do n't know if that will work either .
sorry if this does n't make any sense explaining things is not my strong suit .

i 'm thinking about getting a hardware wallet and i 've found that the digital bitbox would be the cheapest for me because i live in switzerland and they have no shipping cost in here so it would be arround 50€ and for the ledger nano s i would pay 70€ taxes and import ...
so does anyone want to share his experience with rhe bitbox ?

i feel like there should be greater sr loss if teammates do not contribute to the team/have terrible kd ratios .
maybe it 's just me but the disparity of skill at gold/silver levels is aggravating and makes the game difficult for me to enjoy anymore .
too many times i get paired with people who are just messing around and getting high and cost my team the game .
i just finished losing 100 sr thanks to players like this and i felt helpless because of it .
i can not make my teammates get better and there is only so much i can do myself .
we want to draw teams from the world cup ... .8 people get 4 teams total of 32 and decent sites for this ?

i currently have a pc close to my lulzbot and use cura to print from .
i 'm about to move things around it might be easier to mount a pi or an old phone note 4 .
it seems to me ignorant that i am that while cool to have the monitoring of octoprint or astroprint and nice to not have a monitor/keyboard/etc to deal with it 's better to print from a computer right ?
process the file with cura then upload it somewhere then download it on the pi server ?
i 'm over complicating it i 'm sure but what 's the ideal in your opinions .
i 've had multiple strange experiences during this year .
tonight i experienced something i can only describe as sinister dark and disturbing .
i only experience paralysis when i sleep in a certain position and this time i didnt .
then i was suddenly at my uncle 's house where i encountered an old school friend .
we decided to go to the balcony where we had a small chat .
she talked of some friend and metioned she was possesed and needed an exorcism .
in my mind i thought i too was possesed but didnt mention it .
she pointed over to the mountains and i saw beautiful peaks covered in ice a sudden urge of climbing then emerged inside me .
i glanced back at her and poof ... .she was gone .
at this point i knew i was in bed .
a black energy '' began to form in front of me .
like various blasts or strings of energy moving in various directions converging into a single thing .
ive always been interested in sleep paralysis and the paranormal so ive mentalized myself not to fear these strange phenomena .
as it was forming i tried to analyze my situation .
i am an objective and cold-headed person whenever i need to be .
i was looking directly at it and i felt i needed to show confidence so i smirked at it i literally smiled as to send a message i am as sinister and do not fear you '' .
sounds fucked up i know but for a moment it empowered me .
the words possesion repression and shadow as in jung 's concept popped in my head .
then my head started to shake in a freakishly repeated demeanor in a mr. anderson matrix way .
whenever i have sleep paralysis i have the strength to will its end by moving small muscles and my ankles and wrists .
i am a skeptical man who likes to explore ideas of the psyche .
the most rational approach for an explanation it was some sort of manifestation of my shadow carl jung wanting to tell me something .
the best ways to describe this experience are sinister macabre plain disturbing and curious .
i am a strong person and willing to experience more of these each time with due courage to learn more about the unconscious .
i have more of these strange situations if youd like to hear them .
we broke up in august and she posted at the end of september just a long essay on instagram lying about me and shaming me for things that are n't true and she posted another thing on twitter at the end of october and now i just have this longing feeling of shame and im embarrassed because her friends and family have seen it and im sure they believe it .
and i just want to know how to disconnect from the feeling of shame etc ?
i do n't look at her social medias my sister told me about the first incident and i recieved an anonymous message on my blog telling me about the twitter post .

horizontal turret now named quick-shot turret '' and with 12 higher damage .

there 's some precedent a worshipful slave wo n't be broken by being in an industrial dairy so i was wondering if a similar thing might happen with fuckdolls .

not just the final battle and the incredibly satisfying experience of fighting a battle with all your allies but where the story ended up .
the initiative finally being able to settle down and begin to grow coupled with the habitable cluster and the unified political situation i know not 100 true but in general things are good and the known kett empire in the rest of andromeda sets it up so well for a sequel of the heleus cluster alliance versus the kett empire .
you could break out of the cluster fight kett encounter other enslaved worlds and species break them free .
it 's too bad the rest of the game is so flawed and uneven .
if the rest of the game was as good as it 's first 2 hours and last 2 hours the state of this series would be in a totally opposite place .

i 'm currently residing in china and ordered a pair of nt-6s from a reputable online reseller on taobao based in shanghai they were listed on hidition 's webpage as an authorized reseller 上海立声数码 shanghai listen digital audio
i asked the reseller approximate turn-around times with shipping times included and they stated 3 months were typical despite the industry standard being 1/3 of that .
a month in the reseller forwarded messages from hidition for clarification on my order to which i answered .
fast forward 2 months and now its a few days from the 3 month mark and my attempted communication with hidition inquiring about the status of my order is left unreturned .
the reseller has claimed that they have also sent messages inquiring about it and hidition has n't gotten back to them either .

i really enjoyed this sub for figuring out what steps i need to get to address the skin issues i have and i have been having great results with products from brands like mizon cosrx laneige etc .
lately i 've been ending up on the skincare addiction sub while doing research and i 'm always put off by the prices .
i 'm curious about brands like sunday riley or drunk elephant but i look at the formulas and i ca n't really tell objectively why i could n't get this active ingredient in a cheaper formulation from an ab brand .
i get the impression that ab is the same quality as department store skincare but with drug store pricing .
am i wrong in that assumption or should i try department store skincare for myself ?
thank you everyone for replying and for generally being understanding ! !
i know the question really can come off as dumb but i really am lost comparing ab and western skincare so this helps ! !

when i was a child my dad was often going out into the woods .
i was curious back then because he had no clothes and was totally messy when he came back .
sometimes i asked him where he had been and where did his clothes go but he 'd never tell me .
he 'd always say i will tell you when you are old enough . ''
the day i turned eighteen he brought me into the woods .
ever since he died i 've kept my promise to not tell anyone about his secrets ... that is unless you 're old enough to come with me into the woods ?

d. but yoga vasishtha says that the chitta mind of a jivanmukta is achala unchanging .
achala chitta unchanging mind is the same as suddha manas pure mind .
the jnani 's manas is said to be suddha manas .
the yoga vasishtha also says that brahman is no other than the jnani 's mind .
d. will the description of brahman as sat-chit-ananda suit this suddha manas ?
for this too will be destroyed in the final emancipation .
m. if suddha manas is admitted the bliss ananda experienced by the jnani must also be admitted to be reflected .
therefore the jivanmukti state is compared to the reflection of a spotless mirror in another similar mirror .
similarly the jnani 's reflected bliss ananda represents only the true bliss .
it is enough that a person becomes antarmukhi inward-bent .
the sastras are not needed for an inward turned mind .
extract from talks with bhagavan sri ramana maharshi talk 513
tl dr my old friend and his friend i had just met sexually assaulted me while i was sleeping in the middle of the night .
when i confronted him the next morning he freaked out saying he does n't remember anything .
he then proceeded to tell his fiancee who proceeded to attempt to smooth the whole thing over by cutting off ties between us and denying it happening .
i live in japan really far away from home .
my male friend a came to visit with his other male friend b and i met up with them in kyoto an hour train ride .
took them to a restaurant where we had drinks and tapas then we went to a couple clubs and drank some more .
i missed the last train home so friend a offers up their hotel room for me to crash for the night .
i 've known friend a for a few years he 's always been like a brother to me and he has a fiancee that i 've met once before .
i also learn over the course of the night that friend b has a girlfriend so i took their offer to stay over trusting that they would n't do anything creepy .
there were only two separate beds so the guys put the beds together to make one giant bed and let me sleep in the middle .
i fell right asleep because it 's 3am and i was tiredaf .
i woke up in the middle of the night to feel someone groping me under my shirt .
at first i thought it was just a bad dream but then i realized it was friend a and it was actually happening .
his hands wrapped around me and he started to dig into my underwear .
at this point he was simultaneously groping me and touching me below .
after a few minutes he released me from his arms and rolled over back to sleep .
my heart was pounding and i wanted to cry but i was so tired .
i tried to just go back to sleep but then a few minutes later friend b rolled over and tried to plant kisses on my face and neck .
i buried my face away into my pillow and blanket to deter him .
friend b tried a few more times in the middle of the night so i had to more forcibly push him away .
around 7am i got up and dressed and got the fuck out of there to catch the first train back .
friend a texted me later in the morning complaining of his hangover but that it was a great night .
i informed him that he sexually assaulted me in the middle of the night so there might not be a next time if he did n't acknowledge what happened apologized and gave me space .
he started freaking out demanding answers to my accusations and i texted him back exactly what happened .
apparently he blacked out and did n't remember any of it .
at this point i am extremely disturbed and just tell him to leave me alone .
i ended up falling asleep in my bed and waking up to a slew of message from him and his fiancee .
fiancee hi suterunoakaunto i just got some pretty horrifying news from friend a .
can you please tell me what happened last night from your point of view ?
i would really appreciate to hear your side of the story .
fiancee so i know you 're getting these messages and i think it 's super fucked up you 're accusing my fiancé of this and you 're ignoring me .
you 're literally ruining our relationship by ignoring me right now .
i do n't want to talk to her at first but friend a begs me to please copy and paste our chat to her .
i indulged by accepting the messages but almost instantly regretted it .
after explaining what happened she dictated that he will no longer have any contact with you again '' .
she then said things like i think people throw the term sexual assault around super lightly these days '' and i frankly can not see friend a doing this and i 'm sorry that you seem to think so or if it actually happened i 'm sorry that it did but it would have been accidentally .
he would n't intentionally attempt to hook up with you . ''
i can not get a hold of friend a at this point to tell him i do n't appreciate this salt over the wound because he has blocked me .
i do n't really know how to process these feelings .
i do n't have a support system here in this country really .
i know it 's not my fault but i am the only one who remembers what happened and i am feeling very broken and frustrated especially after all the things she said to me .
as if it 's not already dehumanizing to be groped and sexualized like that but to also basically deny it even happening at all .
we have shared friends back home ... i 'm not planning on telling them what happened because it will ruin him and i am not a vengeful person .
i feel bad for friend a because i can understand that it can come as quite a shock to do something so obscene after a night of drinking but i ca n't deny that it happened .

i figured the idea is to just make it as expensive as possible for the government to deal with .
it might not do much to slow it down but it can be annoying as hell .
imagine if cah demanded that they had to pay it out in checks to everyone who contributed to the land fund .
it would be the equivalent of making them pay for the cost of the land in pennies .
see that 's all that matters to me is that someone laughed .

he had not learned to compensate or find a new career .
jk lock him up throw away the key but you know that he is just going to pardon himself .
also have some 4770s and i5 versions if you 're interested .
also why is everyone so hyped on louie lopez ?
dont get me wrong he is amazing but its just not my cup of tea he looks so lurchy .
i guess for me compared to other people like evan smith or jamie foy or decenzo here fuck tecnicaly joslin probobly deserves it on a big trick checklist .
all im saying is in my opinion there are others with bigger more stylish and more technical skateboarding in the past year .
im kind of sick of phelps being the embasidor of core '' skateboarding its an antiquated concept with an antiquated gate keeper .
if pelps is so core then why does he shit on some for selling out and then be head over heels for sheckler .
google tells me elbow uppercut and reverse elbow but i think no matter what you call it people know what it is when mentioning silva 's name with it .
well i still did n't put all the relative information in the post no offense intended .
for the cable you can jist mod it by cutting it around 1.5m and solder a new jack .
comfortable but it wo n't change the general sound other than a bit more soundstage and a bit less mid bass punch .
hm5 are usually what people change for in at m-series but imo they change the sound for the worse .
you can buy an assault rifle without a background check .
assault rifle '' is a military definition and it means select-fire '' fully automatic action .
to transfer an assault rifle '' in the usa requires 200 tax stamp and an fbi background check that takes months to complete .
you also need the 20,000 to buy one that was registered with the government before 1986 .
assault weapon '' is a semi-auto rifle that fires one shot per trigger pull .
many of them are sporterized/civilianized versions of fully-automatic guns but they still only shoot one bullet per trigger pull .
they are no more dangerous than your daddy 's deer rifle or shotgun .
they 're still lethal but they still only fire one shot pull trigger pull .
assault weapons bans have tried banning these rifles before .
there was no discernible drop in crime according to fbi stats .
there were no fewer deaths and really no change in criminal behavior as a direct result of the ban .
rifles of all types ... . assault weapon '' shotgun deer rifle account for fewer deaths in the usa each year than deaths attributed to hands and feet .
criminals literally beat people to death with their own hands more often than they kill people with any type of long gun .
hand guns are responsible for the most 'gun violence ' not rifles .
it makes no sense to try to ban that type of gun based on these facts .
ban and confiscate all of the scare military-styled rifles in the usa and you 'll see a drop in gun violence of about 0.5 .
that 's not worth the cost of political capital time and money it would take to make that happen .
that 's not even mentioning the risk to police or other authorities who would be forced to confiscate the guns in the first place .
you 'd be seeing hundreds of cops killed in shootouts each year over this .
plus police use these same semi-auto rifles to enforce the law .
they 're effective and safer to use than other types of guns .
the police should not have hardware that other civilians can not also get their hands on .
furthermore the heller and miller cases that were decided in the supreme court have ruled that militiary-capable weapons '' are specifically the kind of guns that the 2nd amendment is supposed to protect .
the prefatory clause in the 2nd amendment is simple a stated reason of fact .
it is not a limitation on the operative clause at the end of the amendment that plainly reads the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . ''
that right is ours it transcends government and is enumerated in the bill of rights document to tell government to keep it 's hands off .
so either you 're lying or you wasted a whole lot of time and money
have a big unrealised loss but i have strong hands .
also your post implies you hold some bch but then you wrote this and i 'm very confused

how did we get so quickly from rejoicing the live team was back a couple weeks ago to trying to defund them today ?
i was wondering and fruitlessly googling do states that have filial responsibility laws allow for debt collectors to pursue the children for any remaining debts after the estate is settled ?
i assume not but figured i 'd ask anyway .
i think this is the other things donald trump was talking about during that talk on plutonium/uranium .

well chickens are the descendants of the t. rex ... oh how the mighty have fallen .
i know everyone shits on them and think they 're idiots but i think they do know their stuff at least half the time .
they just usually put a negative view on things which is probably why most people hate them but i usually like hearing that instead of only focusing on the good things the teams might be doing .
with the rogers mastercard you can either spend your rewards on rogers products or services or get the cash back as a credit on your mastercard account .
however if you want the mastercard credit option you have to call them by december 1st each year to have it applied .
i believe they 're contractually obligated to release the follow-up to crack up two years from it so if you did n't know that it 's sooner than you 'd expect .
if i order something under certain parameters and they do n't fulfill them it 's only good customer service for them to fix it .
and if they 're just giving away prime like that what does that really say about its value ?
the only one that i think could actually occur today is shut up and dance .

with hierophant you can put some skills in your helmet though especially with elder/shaper items and get that 20 pen as a little extra then use a kaoms .

why is it then when when brexit voters are asked about the benefits always fall back on the same old soundbites then when you question them and cross examine these points they stutter and stumble over giving any answer as to what we are supposed to be doing ?
the eu benefited us much more than it hurt us .
sure you will never have a perfect system but being alone and separate is not an improvement
there are a number of laws that protect uk citizens that exist because of the eu .
out of the eu the british govt could revoke these rights or water them down a lot maternity sick holiday leave working rights etc etc
people have fallen for the hate preaching and are it seems blissfully unaware of just how much personal protection they had from the eu that was afforded them not out the good graces of the uk govt but as a result of the collective eu .
i do not trust our single govt to act in our best interests
i 'm in the process of leveling up a better version of my team because i retired my team .
i figured the extra stats and skill points would help .
i was also being really dumb when i was trying to fight this guy and i did n't realize that i could have my harbinger use a sleep mist and that would trigger chain killer and do massive damage .
what 's pretty funny though is that i 'm using a couple of aceofivalia 's guild members to take out stratum 4 enemies to level up my new team .
though when bloops say they do n't then their desire to try them becomes stronger because they believe bloops lied to them and that by saying they do n't work is another lie .
on a side note when executing them properly the dark triad traits seem to work well .

really it was cast by a powerful necromancer who wasnt invited .
with so many foes in one place she finally enacts her revenge .
many of the lands greatest arcanists are trapped in time/demiplane/turned to stone .
the sudden power vaccum is causing all kinds of problems as spells fail kings are without advisors and towers are plundered in their absence .
by chance the pcs are spared and must find a way to restore the trapped mages and restore order before the bbeg syphons their combined magic to reshape the world .
all of this makes sense but the problem is that before this all started before i had those particular thoughts i 'd never had pocd specifically before so i 'm not sure a backdoor spike qualifies .
i do n't know that i identified them as intrusive thoughts at all so much as just taboo ones .
if i recall correctly my thought process was just like hah my brain can do whatever it wants and it does n't matter . ''
which i guess does sort of sound like exposure-style thinking now that i think about it .
i never got proper exposure treatment last time just meds which controlled all my symptoms but i do know that i began to hate the idea of trying to control your thoughts so maybe it affected me that way .
a friend and i came up with a theory after watching '' this is the zodiac speaking ' it 's mostly based on assumptions but we feel its pretty accurate .
the zodiac is able to be tied to 4 killings but what if his first real kill was cherri jo bates who was killed on october 30 1966 on the campus of riverside community college .
so what if zodiac was a student at riverside community college .
at the september 27 1969 lake berryasa attack shoe imprints were found that matched the soles of size 11 'wingwalkers ' shoes which at that point were only given to those who worked on aircraft at air bases .
due to the fact that one could only get these shoes at rx 's on airbases let us make the assumption that the zodiac was a member of the air force or air force reserves
lets also assume that zodiac worked at march air reserve base due to its proximity of riverside community college
also riverside had a rotc air force program based at march air reserve base at the time of the killings that was tied to california state university san bernardo which is 26 minutes away by car .
due to the zodiacs understanding of cryptograms lets also assume that one of his classes was math based and was probably advanced .
also many of zodiacs attacks were tied to and coincided with lunar events
so for the sake of argument lets also assume that the zodiac was enrolled in a astronomy class and was also interested in astrology
the next confirmed zodiac killing happened on december 20 1968 on lake herman road just inside benicia city limits .
benicia is within a area with both a airforce base travis airforce base a 30 minute drive and mare island naval complex a 28 minute drive .
so lets assume that zodiac worked at either mare island or travis airforce base .
the next confirmed zodiac attack took place on the july 5 1969 in the parking lot of blue rock springs park in vallejo .
this park is also located within the area of both mare island naval complex here to referred as nc which is a 21 minute drive and 32 minute drive from travis airforce base .
the third killing tied to the zodiac took place on the 27th of september 1969 at lake berryasa in napa county california which is an hour and 23 minute drive from travis airforce base and a 1 hour and 32 minute drive from mare island nc .
the last confirmed zodiac killing happened on the 11th of october 1969 in the the presidio heights neighbourhood in san francisco cherry street .
which is an hour and 15 minutes away from travis airforce base and a 1hr 2min drive from mare island nc
is a 7 minute walk to the the presidio which is a park but was then both a park and an us military base..
i know there a lot of assumptions and what if 's but i figure if you look at men who worked at both mare island and travis airforce base as a airplane mechanic .
who attended the rotc program at riverside college and were enrolled in advanced math and astronomy was interested in astrology and wore size 11 shoes .
your suspect list would be pretty damn short ... ..

it 's all fun and games at first haha that 's what i thought at first too !
at the age of 14 i was already practicing pagan occultist the first book i bought was the necronomicon and the satanic bible i was obsessed with columbine and anything radical evil things were very attractive to me at an early age it drew me in ! ! ! !
i was a gothed kid with dread locks who looked like the walking dead and the supernatural thing that happened to me growing up as a result were life threatening in some cases had my fair share of drugs and drug overdoses !
i thought i was so cool back then with my liberty spikes black nail polish spike wrist bands but what happened in the woods when i summoned the wrong thing haunted me for most of my life ! ! ! !
take my advice from an ex occultist leave it alone ! ! ! !
i try to warn people and they do n't fucken listen !
what ever you gain from it is temporary once the clock is up game over the more you gain the more control the entity has over your vessel !
these entities are not your friends they do n't even like you !
once they no longer need you they will dispose of you and move on like you did n't exist or the hell gates will flood into all areas of your lives all the symbols you wear attract bad omens ! ! !
these things lead to depression anxiety sicknesses suicide and even death your family included !

fuck off and sort out your own problems first .

this trend the complete journey from nihilism to morality to moralism and then back to morality is readily observable in the modern alt-right and in my decade of experience being loosely far right i 've seen it happen many many times .
become disillusioned with the current state of the western world

anger ebbs away calm down about a lot of little stuff
much of your previous libertarian leanings as much as you are now fashy and probably will be forever return to you
it 's super hard to explain to people unless they 've been through it ... but fundamentally one of the things that separates the far left from the far right is that there is a point in ones psychological growth as a far rightist where a lot of 'petty puritanism ' simply fades away .
i personally attribute this to the overtly spiritual nature becoming really far right often takes on but it can be many things i suppose ... the point being it 's a trend i 've observed time and time again .
how do i rune up manannan i ca n't seem to make him work i usually use him in gwo with galleon-mana-ruccuni but i wan na do so much more with him .

the defense also offered expert witnesses who testified that the bullet ricocheted off of the ground and traveled about 78 feet before striking steinle .
the jury 's decision indicates that it was convinced that the shooting was an accident .
it sounds like he 's still going to jail/being deported for illegal possession of a firearm .
it also sounds like to me that the victim 's family wants nothing to do with politicizing sanctuary cities or kate 's death .
yet in aftermath of his sister 's death brad steinle spoke out against candidate trump for sensationalizing '' her death .
'' donald trump talks about kate steinle like he knows her .
i 've never heard a word from his campaign manager i 've never heard a word from him .
it 's disconcerting '' brad steinle told cnn 's anderson cooper .

during the last financial crisis a lot of people lost their jobs and had to dip into whatever resources were available to them .
if the sample size i see here is any indication you 'll see a considerable dip in bitcoin prices in the short term as people need to liquidate to pay for day to day expenses .
i would n't expect btc to move up too much as times of financial crises are when smart money moves in to buy depressed assets at very attractive prices .
if stocks and real estate are on sale that 's where money will flow to .

justification and responsibility remain open questions after you have solved purposefully vs accidental .
op is right and the answer is it does come naturally to them because personality is fate at the very least it strongly appears as such at first sight and some of it is unchangeable .
and this is in fact the very essence of the psychology of personality .
ted bundy did n't kill countless women because he was a psychotic or because he had rational reasons .
he did it because his personality was what it was .

the event only occurs if there are at least four pops on the planet with less than 50 happiness and less than 40 habitability .

dc was actually planning a pseudo-universe in the form of miller 's justice league mortal back in 2009 or so .
because of company complications at the time it was scrapped but they stated they planned to make spin off films and create a film universe like today 's mcu except starting with the team-up film which makes sense because the jl was dealing with its a-list heroes .
they also reattempted it with 2011 's green lantern and we all know how that went .
to say that they were n't continuously motivated by the mcu would be a lie especially since they could have abandoned it after 2 failed attempts but they wanted to do this just as much as marvel just in a different way .
because of that as much as i like the dceu i will always wonder what it would be like for both universes to be potentially critically acclaimed and debut at around the same time .

i was in a bad place yesterday and i posted and not one person responded .
so i 'm not really liking it here at all .
i do n't doubt that it will recover at some point in the far future i just wo n't be bullish on it when it does and i think there is a quite a bit more downside yet
i order some of my edibles from buddabomb they are dosed correctly 2-4 of their 10mg gummies lay everyone i know out they are located in ontario no id just order away

i 'm losing my hearing it gets worse every year .
i use hearing aids and a roger pen i may in the future require a cochlear implant on one side but my audiologist says not yet . ''
if you have slight or minor hearing loss no you don't know what i am going through .
also the people who totally understand are also the ones who do n't face me when they are talking or ca n't fathom why i have trouble on some phones .
the best people just face me when talking repeat when necessary and do n't jump in with some me too ! ''
the closest thing that we would get is a create-a-theme mode as a simple music creator .

after i finish helping the guy who asked for twin princes
that figure was a fine way to celebrate the 10th anniversary but i do n't think i could subject myself to remembering that ending every time i glanced at it .
not quite 1920x1080 but will this help at all ?
i like how she gives it 5 years after an unwanted baby before you start fighting .
mit pulled the walter lewin videos and associated courseware .
minnesota public radio has pulled the garrison keillor episodes of prairie home companion .
seen a acton s2 boosted board and a few evolve boards .
i 'm currently building a diy board to ride which should be finished soon .
they are lucky to be in pot 1 given that uruguay spain and colombia are pot 2 .
it 's definitely fair to question their status as pot 1 given they do n't have any above average form .
they finished top of a very mediocre group and managed to lose to denmark 4-0 recently .
they could easily be in pot 3 to be honest .
having said that they are n't bad or anything you just think they are quite obviously the worst seeded team .
do you care to share why you think it is stupid ?
you honestly have the best responses haha i freaking love it !
i 'll see if i can do a pic collage haha not sure how impressed/turned on you would be tho 😂 you deserve the 10 💋 sounds like the perfect night haha checked all my boxes !
he just made a video for his main series just gushing about the switch but hey that never happened

they did n't speak with him before hand to know his thoughts and all they saw was this tattoo before they pulled his paperwork .
but i do n't see the moral issue either .
what would of happened if they didnt resuscitate and it turned out to be a joke/line in a song/something else ?
so..the answer should be to resuscitate unless they have the the actual document .
the us took down the iraqi army really fast .
any the iraqi army was actually considered more formidable than nk .
if the us gets bombed the military is n't going over to nation build that 's sks job after the smoke clears .
i guess i take back what i said about him .
however does lee have the same kind of contract ?
unless you want to demonstate the backslash characters then you have to put three

click on that and it 'll show your progress .
also go back here once completed to claim your reward .
but to humor you ... busses would have records of where they were that day .
the movie takes a ton of liberties with the joker not existing in any legal sense yet he has the capability to set up very complicated schemes that would require more than gasoline and gunpowder to use his own words .
all the nolan batman movies have a huge reliance on suspense of disbelief .
which is fine but if you want to rip it apart there are countless holes in the plots that nolan just expects you to ignore/does a good job distracting you from .
not sitting here trying to say they are shit or poorly written .
but like others have even pointed out if you take a step back from the cinema of it there is a ton of reliance on the viewer not noticing certain things .
if you check the other comments i did not pick my puppy .
went ahead and got some diamond head irons put on it and a red dot .
nothing special just a little bushnell trs-25 i got for 40 bucks until i can afford the optics i want .
well the good news is that a lot of the deductions will continue as is for a few years so the odds that you are still in school when this is fully implemented are slim the bad news is the us is flushing its economic edge down the toilet to give more money to trust fund babies
i 'm really just looking for duel purpose sticks so that i can hook it up to either my ps3 or ps4 .
for me it 'll be cheaper in the long run to just buy a couple of quality duel purpose sticks than to buy several single purpose ones .
so unless you 're just looking to unload this stick cheap which i doubt you are the link itself is worth 30 i 'm not really interested .
been decades since i really worked with semi-conductors that was a big problem heck the biggest problem back then was no one knew how to make a panel that took less energy than the panel would produce in its lifetime .
but from where there are deployments these days and the prices dropping it sounds like the problems are being surmounted .
hammer curls train the forearm muscles close to the elbow .
they also do n't look like stretch marks to me but just to be sure try to use some kind of good quality skin feeding lotion and keep the area a bit greasy with cetamacrogol creme to avoid getting scars .
wo n't help 100 though but it 's the most you can do .
if u decided to sell it do inform me thanks d
i like that feature of the ledger wallets tells me how much btc i have and what it 's worth in fiat currency .
all studies can be claimed to have bias depending upon who does them their affiliations and what group pays for them .
there are enough questions raised about the origin and premise of the induced demand theories that i am fine with believing it is not an inevitable force of nature .
i just really love how everyone celebrates an old pagan holiday as jesus 's birthday .
if one wants an archipelago of competing tax havens making the south east of england its own country would be a good way to do it particularly since it 'd immediately have a race-to-the-bottom with ireland .
it 's because they enjoy exactly this kind of creepy '' awful '' stuff
true but i think there are going to be practical issues .
3,500 bars of soap will therefore weigh 350kg that 's about 770lb and require something in the region of 200 litres of oil .
you 're either going to have to invest in some fairly heavy-duty equipment to churn out that much a week or you 're going to find yourself spending all day every day making the stuff giving you no time to sell it which means you need to pay someone else to sell it which means you now need to make enough soap to pay them too ... .
not to mention the space required to store even one week 's worth of raw ingredients and finished soap .
even making bars half that size after all a lot of artisanal soaps are sold in quite small bars still requires a substantial amount of raw materials .
cuz he was good but that he decided to be really lazy
i 'm going back as well easy way to make elite tokens .
cast time is a common form of balance dude go play some dota 2 .
at least for me in the uk all utilities are paid out of pocket .
clubbing is n't really my scene but i appreciate your input !
im fortunate to own both psvr and vive and yeah the psvr community just seems to enjoy vr alot more than the vive lot .
i got doom vfr on psvr simply because of the aim and although not played alot im really enjoying it .
i love the vive but the psvr with its put the headset on and just play appeals to me more at the minute more so than the setting up and tweaking games to run better on the vive
a lot of it depends on the difficulty setting you play on too .
i can burn through an easy play-through in under an hour but normal takes me more like two hours and i will agonize over every decision if i 'm playing on hard mode .
yeahhhh except that the next historic total war and indeed the saga standalone that 's coming out is almost certainly going to have settlement siege battles unless ca wants their audience to throw a collective shitfit .

thanks and i think i got lost in translation here being english not my first or second language .
i 'm curious if you are still waiting for the answer or you decided to just go to domino 's website already to find out for yourself ?
that 's exactly how i came across a naked picture of my step mom when she was still my dad 's girlfriend .
clearly you are unaware of the gladiator championship in the uk .
the biggest problem with the battlebox is that with modern spinners the risks of something leaving the battlebox with high velocity is pretty high .
the rw arena has more air and lexan between people and robots so even when something gets ripped off it generally does n't touch the main wall between audience and robots .
as neitzsche said do n't try to protect the truth as if it was a defenseless maiden .

peterson 's credentials and ideas stand on their own feet and everyone who mischaracterises him slowly loses their credibility piece by piece word by word and lie by lie .
i do n't know a huge amount about it as it was cancelled but the original purpose was to get humans to mars in the 70s/80s they felt that chemical rockets would just be too big to manage the trip .
so the stats are based off research papers and plans but nothing concrete to know if they would have been possible .
i do know that they model electricity generation at the inverse square of the distance from the sun which i think is correct but since ksp just uses electric charge '' as a resource rather than voltage amperage resistance etc. it 's very oversimplified at best .
i think it 's an awesome idea if he pulls it off we joked about sending a tesla to mars as payload but the crazy bastard decided to put his own car on the rocket .
i am somewhat interested to see what is meant by mars orbit .
if they can navigate the journey for a close encounter and also have a plan to either aerobrake and then raise the periareon maybe feasible or have enough fuel to capture at mars into orbit less likely imo without significant modifications to falcon heavy 2nd stage that would be amazing .
i suspect however that he just intends a fly-by which would still be cool just a bit less so .
i wonder would it have been avoided if social medias existed at the time ?
remember they did tweak the sauber livery in 2015 so its possible theyll make some subtle changes once sponsors are finalised .

the two dogs i saw looked identical so i thought they were twins and did n't think they were doing the dirty .
modern windows developed from the nt line which was business oriented .
password protecting individual files is an unwieldy unscalable insecure and inefficient way of doing things .
use a password on a file and in dave from accounting changes departments losing access to accounting files we have to change the password on all of those files .
use permissions and when it removes dave from the accounting group he loses access to all of those files .
i do n't see how anyone would argue it is not illegal .
i drive 150 miles round trip everyday do i can make 5 times that .
otherwise i too would be making 12 an hour .

pretty sure fred is well in on the tank .
i think it 's telling he 's getting his team off to fast starts and in the first half will call a to every time the other team gets some momentum .
then in the 3rd quarter he sorta just watches as the other team catches up and takes a small lead normally duringbthis stretch you 'll see the bulls with some strange lineups .
then in the 4th he brings out the starters but had holiday encouraged to take absurd shots .
holiday even starts grinning when they actually go in .
i dunno maybe it 's all just rzndom chance but i 've seen this pattern a lot this season and it does n't make sense that hoiberg is suddenly a different coach during the 3rd every game otherwise .
oh i kind of meant spider-man but you 're right .
in an interview with dracos from iron armada i asked what was wrong with melzy he stated she is a cunt ''
that 's an interesting way to map the prison of air !
davidos had the game and gave wonder one shot at getting lethal .
he knows akawonder plays with swashburglar and these things happen .
playing ice block was much safer play and when you had no lethal next turn you could play jaina next turn .
ok now it is starting to get scary he is having the second most efficient ever season of 25 ppg trailing steph by 0.3 while dropping 9 dimes and being an anchor on defense this is simply unparalleled much more so for a soon to be 33 year old .
after two years and a half i 've collected useless stuff on my computer and i 'd like to do a fresh install .
however not all games use steam cloud and i have many saves of gog/uplay/origin and even dolphin games .
can i store them in onedrive and re-dl them after reinstalling everything ?

i bought a usb to ps2 adapter and that is also not working .
if it 's of any importance i 'm using a huion monitor tablet .
what does everybody think about implementing jedi/saber-wielding reinforcements into multiplayer ?
they would obviously be less powerful than a hero character damage dealt health abilities etc .
but could have some similar abilities to the jedi heroes just toned-down a bit .
fun to play and able to be used strategically by good players but not able to turn the tide of battle like luke or vader .
this would allow players who do n't often get to play as hero or light saber characters a chance to play as a generic jedi or light-saber user without having to worry about accruing thousands of battle points only for the match to end or to die instantly upon spawning .
i think this is also a missed opportunity lore-wise as i know there are many unseen jedi in the star wars universe that do n't get any screen time but that appear in the background of scenes or in other forms of media .
maybe it could just be a generic jedi character for each side or perhaps this would be a good opportunity to implement customization options for something other than troopers ?
is there any scrap of news or evidence from comments the show creators etc whether miller or 'the investigator ' will be making an appearance in season 3 or ever ?

you 're so fucking parasitic you might as well be actually fucking killing me .
just want to to know if i eventually get out of sr b will i get matchmade with less asshole drivers .
just finished a race where i had pole position .
into the first corner i immediatly get pit maneuvered and spin out .
recover to be in 4th while still having my sr go down which is annoying as fuck .
later in the lap on a high speed corner i get pushed off the track well i went off instead of hitting the guy who boxed me in puts me down to last 3 where im dealing with getting rammed from behind and being blocked by guys swerving in front .
this was my first race back after rage quiting a race 3 days ago after some similar bullshit .
i love this game but this bollox with other drivers needs to pass or im gon na have to stop playing all together for the sake of my sanity .
also seeing that your sr going down symbol when you wernt at fault and were crashed into is such a kick in the balls .
i am currently searing for a good and not too expensive gaming headset 300€ .
my last headset was the logitech g933 wireless headset and it broke down on me last month .
so i am not searching for a wireless headset again except it has decent battery life .
so my question to you guys is what headset do you use and do you like it or what headset should i buy when i want to have decent sound quality a price under 300 bucks and a good microphone quality .
i only have one 4 star champed at the moment iw and i was planning on champing vulture next however i 've run into a 5/1/5 situation that i 'm not sure i 'm going to be able to get out of anytime soon .
i say that considering my bad rng recently with my 4/0/0 teen jean and 16 ares covers on the vine waiting on a sunder .
i know that i 've heard people compliment him when he 's boosted but how does he perform unboosted ?
something i can do with a few friends at night to a nice lookout like mt nugungun .
trying to figure out if in fullscreen the game is capped at 60 or just doesnt perform well it uses almost none of my hardware and the game would look pretty fluid in 120 fps .
they did a damn good job at making it a challenge and it 's a fun replayable map .
the casual is fun and the hardcore is just as it says hardcore .
i see a lot of people griping about not getting zombies supply drops but really they are only useless consumables .
if you have to rely on consumables for zombies then maybe you should keep practicing to get better .
yes it has it flaws here and there but then look at all zombies games they all have their own flaws .
if the community keeps lashing out on sledgehammer games about zombies do you think that they are gon na put in any effort for any patches dlc or future games ?
let 's show everyone why the cod zombies community is the best one out there .
let 's get behind sledgehammer and if you ca n't then just wait until bo4 .
thanks guys just tired of seeing all the negative vibes .
we should be glad we have a zombies mode !
am i the only one who wishes there was a buy x100 button for artifacts
i can generate a paper wallet via the website bitaddress.org even while my computer is offline which is recommended
once i have a paper wallet created i can send my btc to that qr code given and my coins will not be on the interwebs anywhere ?
can someone please eli5 for this one i am not that tech savy i think .
once i have my btc on a paper wallet i can use the qr code address not the private spend '' qr code to add more btc to my wallet .
if i want to retrieve my btc from the paper wallet or send some to another address or person i only have to use the spend '' qr code ?
is the paper wallet site i mentioned a safe one ?
to be honest ... with how btc is growing and all the hype in the world currently i am beginning to feel more protective over my btc .
i do n't have much currently but i still want to learn these things for future use .
i currently only use an exchanger which i know is not a good idea .
i am looking to learn more about the safe movement of btc before i make a dumb mistake and lose what i have .

i am posting this again because last time i made a mistake and flaired it as a quick question
sure you could say that she could be some sort of swan princess but she seems more like a baby chick to me .
her tiara reminds me of a head crest her cape reminds me of wings and her footwear partially reminds me of it as well .
maybe it is the entire feather thing with the cape making her look bigger than she is .
i am wanting them flush obviously ... can i razor blade them smooth ?
afraid to damage the integrity of the grout but do n't want the grout catching and growing bacteria either .
i 've updated the bot to use the new praw functions and everything but assigning the flair itself gives me a 403 error and nothing else .
i 'm not sure why and the documentation is very sparse for flair the user used for the script is a moderator so it 's not a permission issue .
after his curiosity over whether or not he should purchase a pillow yesterday norman woke up thankful his faithful cat had supported him in his choice to stick with the old one .
as he 'd promised the day prior he went to his pantry only to find he was all out of wet food .
he spoke softly i 'm sorry norman i 'll head to the store . ''
norman meowed in agreement as norman walked out the door .
at the store checkout norman saw pillows for sale 60 off .
he placed one in the basket with his 6 cans of cat food and smiled .
when he arrived home he cracked open a can of cat food and norman brushed next to his leg as he started eating his cat food .
he pulled the pillow out of the bag and set it next to his beloved cat .
we can both use a good night 's sleep tonight . ''
and sure enough that night on his way to bed he looked at norman .
he was cuddled up on the pillow with a look of kitty contentment on his face .

i went out for dinner with my family a traditional thing in my family for birthdays and then had plans to hang out with them for the night .
i told my girlfriend 6 months that i would come see her tomorrow but she said i clearly do n't like her that much since i wo n't see her tonight .
then she told me it would n't work out with us which i guess i 'm fine with because that 's pretty controlling i think .
i think i 'm more pissed that i had to spend my night having a stressful conversation while i wanted to enjoy family time
lately i 've been getting into podcasts more and i even thought it 's a longshot are there any podcasts that relate to choral classical music ?
i actually forgot applications were due same date as uc .
oh well i probably would have never been able to make it there with my pollen allergies .
i was reading about how disney is in talks with 21st century fox to buy their film assets once again and was wondering what the best way would be to introduce the fantastic four into the mcu .
given how marvel studios retconned peter parker into iron man 2 and used other such trickery to find ways to enhance their universe so too i think they will find a way to introduce the fantastic four and their villains without having to tell their origin story .
something like this makes sense over doing another origin story given the failure that was fant-four-stic '' .
obviously this all hinges on legal acquisitions and so forth so it 's kind of difficult to speculate on specifics .
but the point is i think marvel will find a way to say the fantastic four have always been here '' .
one idea i would like is if say somehow the four are erased from existence which also erases their impact on history and relationships with established characters .
their reintroduction could begin with reed somehow fixing things and getting them back to mcu earth but the timeline is forever changed .
they 'd be like the fish out of water in the mcu meeting all the established characters again for the first time .
the four or six or seven if you want to include doom valeria and franklin have memories and experiences with characters that never for the esablished characters and they essentially have to start from scratch in the mcu with the benefit of not having to do an origin story .

2003 is prime so the largest prime factor of 4003997 is 2003
their solution involves just knowing the square of 2001 by heart .
if you do have to make a press post you can get me saying that i am sorry for the confusion and for the lack of consultation with the government and with the people . ''
i just think that it was redundant at that point to implement an amendment of that nature
we 've already established our neutrality alongside our fighting spirit
i like our military ireland is in need of a defence force that can do something like actually defending i do not wish for us to get involved in foreign military implications
it is my opinion that this amendment is redundant and asanine as our neutrality is cemented enough
we will stand in the next election on our usual policies of economic freedoms progressivism and eu activity
your god snapcrackle mind me asking why you whipped against it ?
fair doss hey adam you just advanced to level 11
i do n't particularly like the eu although leaving it under a tory government will be disastrous
so you do n't just wish i had n't affirmed our neutrality you want ireland to join the wars ?
of course if we 're joining we 'll need a proper defense force
pd are more radical and less economically conservative than advertised .
i 'm no fan of nato either but ireland is n't a member in any case .
it 's important that we support our allies in the eu should they require assistance
i believe we support the people whose countries they conduct war in as well
if the eu strongly objected to our neutrality they have the power to make it a point of contention .
but what of an invasion from elsewhere not in the mideast and we are fighting defensively
we need to provide for the common defence of the eu
well i do support a nice plump federal europe or confederated at least
hmm it 's when people move to fortress europe or us v them mentality that i 'm particularly glad the eu allows us more nuance and variance than that .
also ireland allows its citizens to serve in foreign armies .
my pc is slightly underpowered for this game is it harmful to my pc of i run it
for me it has to be luke and kylo .
mainly because their abilities kinda suck or at least do n't work properly .
luke having 2 push abilities that do small damage is puzzling .
also pushing players is not useful in many situations .
kylo 's abilities look great on paper but i almost never do well playing him .
he seems to die faster than maul who has no block .

i 've been looking for a sequencing solution that will act as a brain for my setup .
right now i have a tr-8 minilogue micromonsta and volca keys i might eventually add 1 or 2 more synths and a sampler if i do n't get the mpc .
ideally i 'd like a piano roll in a box '' it 's what makes sense to me but i do n't want to take a laptop on stage or to jams .
i know ableton can do what i want so with that aside let 's talk hardware sequencers .
the circuit electribe and digitakt look great but i need more polyphony .
8 note poly sequencing is my minimum and ideally i 'd like 12-16 or more to cover expanding my setup and future proofing .
so i 've been looking at the pyramid and the classic mpcs .
pyramid unlimited polyphony unlimited sequence length a mini piano roll display pretty flexible song modes/performance features cc automation .
i 'm not really interested in using the pads to perform but maybe someday .
same with euclidean sequencing and poly rhythms might be useful down the line but it 's not what i 'm doing now .
mpc 1000 high polyphony not sure if unlimited adequate sequence length cc automation how does it compare to the pyramid ?
it has a history of classic records made on it .
however the workflow seems dated and navigating all the upgrades jjos versions and dealing with heavily used equipment seems daunting .
ultimate concerns workflow immediacy performance/song mode features ease of recording and tweaking midi notes ccs
am i missing something that i really should be looking at ?
how do these two compare when it comes to sequencing a full rig ?
sampling is n't that important to me now but i am sure i 'd find use for it that said i would n't mind getting a simple sampler like the volca sample with the retrokits cable and having the sequencer drive it later down the line .
thanks for reading this far and for any help you can provide !
just a little thing i wrote a few months back ...
a couple weeks ago some of my friends started college .
one of them said that in their sociology class their teacher started the class with asking is george washington a terrorist ? to which another friend of mine said yeah the british probably saw him as we see isis today .
the teacher had asked the question to try to give the students a different perspective of world conflicts .
the main problem with this perspective is that it is not true at all .
i have found nothing to suggest that the british king parliament or whatever thought that the colonists were terrorists .
in an interview on npr professor stanley weintraub said the british parliament was quite unrepresentative .
the british parliament largely was based on men who were elected from the small towns and farmlands and not from the burgeoning big cities that were growing up with the industrial revolution .
so manchester or birmingham did n't have any seats in parliament and the british said why are you complaining you in america ?
we 're not representative but we 're happy . ' ''
the british parliament saw the americans more as people who are loudly complaining about something that is n't a problem .
while the british government did hate the revolution they only referred to it as things like traitorous '' and rebellion '' never once viewing the continental army as terrorists .
england at the time had the most free press in the world .
washington was well respected by the press in their country even papers against the revolution called him a man of sense and great integrity .
while outright support was very limited many popular newspapers referred to the colonists in america as their brethren .
a former british governor of massachusetts called americans the new world 's chosen people .
the national army museum held a contest to identify england 's best military adversary .
in order to qualify for the contest the military commanders had to be from the 17th century and onwards and had to actually have lead an army on the battleground against the british .
each of the contenders had to have their case be made by a 40 minute long presentation given by a historian that represented the contender .
after the ballot that occurred after each presentation that was made george washington had won the contest .
dr. stephen brummel the historian that represented washington has said that the british officers considered him a worthy opponent .
upon the ending of the war many people in america and throughout europe thought that washington would take full control of the country .
when hearing that washington was going to resign as the military commander and not become the new ruler of america king george iii said if he does that he will be the greatest man in the world . ''
all of these suggest that the british saw washington and the colonists fighting for their independence as traitors and rebels not terrorists .
the national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism also known as start has listed three criteria for acts to be considered terrorism and an act needs to hold two of the three criteria to be included in their global terrorism database .
the three criteria are as listed criterion 1 the act must be aimed at attaining a political economic religious or social goal .
in terms of economic goals the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion .
it must involve the pursuit of more profound systemic economic change .
criterion 2 there must be evidence of an intention to coerce intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience or audiences than the immediate victims .
it is the act taken as a totality that is considered irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention .
as long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce intimidate or publicize the intentionality criterion is met .
criterion 3 the action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities .
that is the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law particularly the prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians or non-combatants .
only with following a very loose definition of the first criterion can you consider washington and the colonists who fought for independence as terrorist because they fought for the political goal of the independence of the colonies .
this is quickly negated by the third criterion though as it takes place in warfare .
washington and the colonists fighting alongside him were well respected by their military enemies and newspapers some 3,000 miles across the atlantic .
the british parliament and king george iii while disgusted with the revolution only considered washington and his men as traitors not as terrorists .
to compare the founding fathers people who revolted against an unjust government that treated them unfairly and refused to represent them while fighting for enlightenment ideals to the religious extremists in the middle east who slaughter anyone that believes in anything other than radical islam is the most preposterous comparison one could make .
not only is the argument for it weak it is insulting the very ideas the founders fought for during the creation of this great country .

i 've made mistakes in the past that have led to this life i 'm living right now .
i can show i 'm outgoing but seriously depressed inside .
like i said 36 and working for a dry cleaners in utah .
i have no college degree and just have a high school diploma.no certifications and no really good work experience that sets me apart from other people .
my mom pushed me to study and study hard .
i pushed back and rarely went to high school .
my mom kept telling me to be successful in life you need a degree in life .
i did a short stint in community college but bouncing around to different schools my federal student loan money ran most of it out .
i did n't date around like i should have .
although a lot of people get married young in utah .
i now have two young boys and i want to get them a house one day .
if i get kicked out of the house i do n't know where to go and that really scares me .
i do n't want to be on the streets begging strangers for money .
my wife does n't work and she stays home .
our youngest has medical needs and has a lot of medical appointments .
i really want to get a better fulfilling job .
people i have reached out before have told me to learn a trade .
i do prefer working by myself but i can work in teams if i am forced to .
i 've tried it and it did n't work out .
i like hearing about successful people that are happy and make good money but do n't have a college degree .
i just want to get out of this rut and i do n't know how to start .
the only positive thing in my life are my kids and i 'm losing weight .
i hope i can get some good feedback and helpful advice here .
i 'm making an account and got this email asking for the girst 3 digits of my ssn .

hidden in the depths of qiandao lake in china lies an eerily beautiful sunken city .
the city known as shi cheng lies 40m underwater in zhejiang province 400km south of shanghai .
its name loosely translates to quot lion city quot but since the regal city was drowned and forgotten about until recently shi cheng has come to be dubbed the quot atlantis of the east quot .
according to the bbc nearly 300,000 people were relocated for the project some of whom had families that had lived in the city for centuries .
interest in this ancient city frozen in time increased when qiu feng a local official in charge of tourism introduced the idea of using shi cheng as a destination for diving clubs .
the city has also attracted interest from archaeologists and a film crew has been on site to record the preservation of the lost ruins .

i think i am ready to purchase but would love to get some constructive criticism if anything needs to be changed .
so i had some bitcoin sitting in my circle account .
i used it exactly once to send the equivalent of 10usd to a usenet porn indexer .
the smallest domination i could purchase was 20 worth so i just had it sitting there .
with bitcoin being in the news and all and me recently discovering this subreddit and its endless hilarity i set myself up a wallet and now i 've got myself 17.9 satoshis .
200 bucks is a pretty large sum of money to me .
i wanted buy some computer parts but nowhere in canada accepts bitcoin as a means of payment no surprise there .
newegg.com does but you have to use a third party bitpay whatever the hell that is for the transaction .
i 'm not too put out because the 10 i put in is now worth '' more if you can apply worth to bitcoin .
i did see one site that sells cigarettes for btc but they do n't have the ones i want gauloises brunes unfiltered .
i now understand why people are so gung-ho on trading cryptos .
the fact that my 10 dollars worth of bitcoin is now valued much higher than that is kind of elating .
at the same time my rational mind which has been following this sub is telling me this is n't real '' money and that the market could collapse at any time .
it 's such a trivial amount but to me it seems like a lot given that i live on disability .

the cactuar dunes are open right now and end at the end of the day today 23 hours after this post is made so the best way to compare is to see if a lapis refresh or two is a better place to get your exp .
this bundle gives us 2,000,000 exp for 150 lapis or about 13,333 exp per lapis spent .
the cactuar dunes gives us an average of about 9333 exp per nrg in the paradise stage .
if you 're rank 106 with a cap of 143 nrg then 150 lapis worth of refreshes gives you an average of 1,987,929 exp .
if you 're rank 108 with a cap of 144 nrg then 150 lapis worth of refreshes gives you an average of 2,015,928 exp .
results once you hit rank 108 it 's statistically better to lapis refresh in cactuar dunes for nrg while under that rank it 's statistically better to just buy the bundle .
the 20 king metal minituars will go into your inbox for you to claim whenever you want rather than straight into your inventory so you can claim them later without worrying about your unit inventory right now but you also need to have 20 open spaces when you do claim them which might influence it 's value for you .
cactuar dunes gives metal gigantuars as well as the king metal minitaurs so while the exp is comparable it takes more overall gil to level your units since the exp is spread over more cactuars from the dunes whereas the bundle is all king metal minituars so takes less gil to fuse .
the cactuar dunes gives a little bit of rank exp 160 rank exp per 30 nrg so about 5.33 exp/nrg or 768 rank exp for 144 nrg while the bundle does not .
the bundle has immediate results with no grinding whereas cactuar dunes takes a little while to grind out .
the cactuar dunes ends today while the bundle ends 2 days after dunes do so tomorrow the choice is gone unless you wan na wait till the next time cactuar dunes comes up which is if i recall correctly once a month .
as many people have pointed out the bundle is a guaranteed 2,000,000 exp whereas the cactuar dunes relies on rng so your mileage may vary .
if you choose the cactuar dunes route it 's very possible you 'll end up with more or less nrg than just buying the bundle which i kept referring to when i said statistically '' and on average . ''
lapis is almost always innately worth more than a large chunk of immediate exp unless you spend money on the game .
people from f2p to even dolphins may want to look at both this bundle and lapis refreshing more harshly as the lapis can usually be used for better things i.e .
things that only lapis/money can do such as expand slots pull units or significantly reduce time on the tmr grind .
of course this analysis is only worth looking at if you were going to spent lapis on cactuars which you were planning to if you were going to buy the bundle in the first place anyways .
edit making it clear that cactuar dunes are open today and end today .
also some other considerations in the form of a bulleted list .

so if you assaulted a base this month threat gets set to 4 in non-dw games and to either 4 or threat whichever is higher in dw games .

it should just set it to the max in my opinion .

now it never gets that much worst than that but it 's at that level 2-3 times a week .
i 'm divorced she is fairly newly married 5yrs .
do n't get me wrong the '' man '' side of me wants to bend her over an office table right after lunch .
but i unfortunately was raised with some moral code so i 've just stayed away from her .

i was at a friend-of-a-friend 's house did n't know him super well but he was within my circle of friends i knew he liked me and that was fine .

this evolved into him saying i 'd really like you to stay '' in a kind of you do n't have a choice '' manner while standing in front of the door blocking my exit .
i remember thinking i was going to get raped and/or killed and instantly flicking through every scenario in my head .
i decided to try talking my way out of it i ca n't even remember what i said but somehow i convinced him i was too nice '' to sleep with him so soon and we needed a few more dates .
never been so happy to get out of a house in my life .
i 'm still sure he has no idea there was anything wrong with that scenario .
i 've never touched this setting but i was at 16 bit when i looked .
we live in a world where hunters try to survive long enough vs priests to win the value game because their hero power allows them to out-values the priest in the long game .

i referred to them as mysterious and books '' because until now you did n't actually say which books to read just books like any old book i happen to pick would be full of information about the ideas of your favourite economic system .
which you had n't mentioned what it was either or anything at all about it really except that it would allow jamaicans to not sell their labour while still getting their imports i assume and would probably not include capitalism .
it 's like saying you know this band that is playing really suck i wish this much better one that i know of was playing '' and when you get asked which one you 'd just answer just like listen to some records dude just listen to some records ... '' without mentioning any band name ...

i do n't really see how women are n't represented well '' in ww .
i do n't see how a gay character with a lisp is bad '' representation either .
they are n't failures at being progressive for that .
that 's why it 's great to have more than one representative ...
i am not sure how you old you were in 2009 it was 8 years ago so if you are the typical college going randia user then it was before your time but every day leading up to the elections was all about the weak pm '' jibe that advani said and the countering from congress .
sonia gandhi had made it clear that she would n't be pm or take up any post .
raga was still only involved in youth congress iirc .
but its whatever works for the both of you .
in my first serious relationship texting everyday was one of the hardest things i had to get used to .
i 'd rather not give you deets about this relationship cause its not one i 'd want to base advice for you on
but i did find it easier to use snapchat as weird as that may sound .
it felt a bit closer to be able to see what the other is doing throughout the day .
i 'd snap him photos of things around me whatever i was doing atm funny things i encountered .
it was easier than having to form words when things were uneventful .
looks almost like the hash back in the day .
bet it smokes even better than it looks too !
tapu fini is great vs mega gengar and walls koko .
i 'm actually receiving a lot of positive feedback about the deck in every ranking tier .
it 's just a very different playstyle because of fini 's new ability .
well lego games are always just glitchy pieces of crap on any platform which is why you are hearing that .
in terms of laggy ness and stuff like that it really just depends on how well the developer optimizes the game .
some third party games turn out great and only have to have slight downgrades but none that really matter but some are just pieces of garbage .
for the most part i 'd say the third party are mostly quality games and well worth the slight downgrade for portable but there are some rime and sonic forces for example that have far to much downgrades just because they were to lazy to do better .
i 've updated it to add what i 'm considering giving .
they are both into skincare but they do n't really take the time to research themselves .
i 've gifted both of them products and they 've continued using them .
they never say this about male directors for female driven movies .
yeah but i do n't find those jokes very funny at all .
that said those are n't usually the hyper upvoted ones .
..the entire front page of r/politics right now at this exact moment is literally all shareblue and thehill.com '' articles .
the second highest voted thread currently is directly from share blue 's website .
to say it usually is n't like that is incredibly dishonest .
level 75 almost 76 with 184,431 cp and 18,575 p.atk .
standard cp is at 180,000 right now but it will probably go up to 183,000 or so after i hit 76 .
that 's how a lot of places in co started but the shops are starting to spread out to those more rural areas now .
i want her out of the job but this is n't the reason .

owner of the electric kazoo here.it 's only alright .
the way it 's designed to work hurts the kazoo 's quack .
the microphone plugs into the top hole which air is supposed to escape from .
now it does have holes for air to escape from but the quack is for the most part gone .
i mostly just keep the kazoo in my gitar case to play instead of singing as a bit of a joke .

urban meyer is way too committed to the qb run in close games .
no point to having 2 stud rbs if you do n't use them like alabama does for example .
qb does n't need to be a battering ram .

before plex i would transfer everything to usb now that is to much of a hassle haha
the one take i had from outliers that i 've found helpful/comforting was that if you do a thing for enough time you 're going to get better at it generally speaking .
i 've come to realize there 's no immediate gratification for hard work .
but it 's so counter intuitive ... . you put in all this hard work but the biggest factors to success are completely out of your control and unpredictable .
i 'd like to think i 'm an extremely competent and hard worker but honestly i 'm where i am because i threw all my chips on red a couple times and got lucky .
and that 's not to say i 'm living high off the hog .
i make enough money work in the spot i feel like may pay off if things go well in the next couple years .
but 500 in litecoin last week ... maybe some day it 'll be enough to pay off my student loans .
i 've gone 25-4 with kuku in assault once and my team was mad i did n't f6 with them just because i was doing well when they were n't but we won .

i have a few local pd 's on my contact list .
the few times i 've had to do it where i felt they were going to cause injuries or a crash they told me to stop following and never sent anyone out .
although there was one time with a wrong way driver they sent someone but it was too late and i couldnt follow .
whenever i see build recommendations i 've noticed sound cards were n't included .
i do n't think you realise how easy it is to facebook stalk someone with the most basic of information .
the burning of the medal brings with it great symbolism .
every streaming service other than sling and philo have it .
fox news does n't offer a standalone live streaming service or broadcast free via satellite or anything like that .
so find the one that carries the most channels that you want at the price you 're willing to pay .
maybe that 'll mean sticking with sling and having to do without or maybe it 'll mean switching services and having to pay a little more per month .
only you can decide what works best for you .

97 of ceos agree that trickle down economics is not real .

the problem was that they do n't control their own currency .
if they controlled their own money they could have kept on spending a lot ie increasing the supply of money in circulation with the result that they see high inflation and depreciation of their currency vs other currencies .
however since the euro is n't controlled by greece depreciation is n't and inflation were n't tools at their disposal .
therefore they look very much like a household and ca n't go spending willy nilly .
and for that matter none of the countries using the euro zone can spend willy nilly until they decide to unify under one government a la us .
a better to think about it is us states .
us states ca n't spend whatever the fuck they want because they do n't issue the currency .
the us federal government can do whatever the fuck it wants until no one trusts us money .
best way to test it is just to jump in and measure results yourself .
setup a baseline test playing 1080p video in vlc in linux and windows for example run it in windows .
you 'll have some decent results to work with then .
run each test at least three times and average results .
damn it i thought this was a news article it first and got my hopes up .
it 's the pc term everyone calls them pikeys or gypsies in reality .
i definitely would n't have minded but i appreciate the fact that we 're playing a ranked opponent .

if that 's the case start playing expensive games so that your expectations can be couched within reasonable contexts instead of being compared to one wunderspiel .
what i find stupid about his whole thing on top of everything else is that the tax cuts run a deficit .
it 's not just that you are cutting taxes on mostly the rich .
you are literally giving them crredited money because of the deficit .
sadly i 've never played a wizard class before but there is a warlock class i 've found where your patron is a living archive !

i said that the bible did n't matter which is true
i said an incoming president is not forbidden from communicating with foreign nations this is also ture .
i do n't recall saying that lying to the fbi was a minor crime but if i did it was probably becuase it is a minor crime usually tacked on to other charges or reserved for when they do n't have anything else to file .
nobody is sitting on a life sentence for lying to the feds .

actually the number 4 team is us based on h2h and record .

i never work my calf muscles and i have to say they 're pretty nice .
you seem to be taking everything i 'm saying personally for some reason when i 'm not at all meaning the things i 'm saying to be an attack .
i think having children is n't so much a right as it should be a privilege .
the fact of the matter is that when people can choose when and if they have kids that society benefits as a whole .
it 's only logical to say that financially and emotionally stable parents raise more productive and healthy adults .
i personally was not raised by my parents after the age of 6 because they were addicts and otherwise mentally and financially unstable .
my grandparents raised me and my siblings as burdens .
make sure your kids know they 're wanted and cared for and all that .
i 'm not attacking you but expressing an opinion .
al pastor are awesome definitely try those they 're kinda the mexican equivalent to shawarma/shish taouk but made out of pork really good with pineapple and spicy salsa verde .
there are other kinds too like carnitas suadero chorizo campechano tripa tripes and if you feel like going wild there 's de cabeza too head tacos so like tongue brain etc the guys that sell them are usually in stands on street corners .

yeah their current studio is over in coverdale and i think he lives in langley now .
say i have 100 eth that i bought at 100 that are worth 500 each now .
if i trade them for litecoin god forbid then i am on the hook for 15 of 40k my gains or 6000 .
now i have 44k worth of litecoin and the govt has 6000 .
now i have 88k and the govt still has 6k .
if i sell my litecoin i now owe them 44k*.15=6.6k for a total of 12,600 in tax .
if they had not charged me capital gains my coins would be worth 100k 15 tax 15000 which is 2,400 more than they get doing it that way .
it 's because the tax they would normally take appreciates if the value of my coins goes up .
sitting in their bank it does n't make much if anything .
edit not just would the government have 2,400 more i would have 85k instead of 81.4k .
everyone loses especially when you factor in that a lot of these trades are internationa

you mean if a man frequently makes one-time as in does n't bring it up again if she says no passes at women that he 's known for at least some while and sincerely thinks like him and that there would be no inherent problem with him dating if they did like him and does it in a way that 's not rude or objectifying just things along the lines of 'would you like to get coffee some time ' again to someone he 's known for some time and is already on friendly terms with ?
i do n't think he 's terribly likely to be villified no .
if you pay extra on your loan without specifying where you want the money to go then it is generally applied as a regular '' payment the funds satisfy your normal payment and the additional goes toward your next monthly payment .
eventually enough overpayment is made and advances the next payment due date .
since payments are applied first to interest and the remainder to principal it is essentially the same as designating that you choose your additional payment to be applied as an additional principal '' payment .
for what it 's worth i pay extra on my loans and choose to have my overpayment applied as a regular payment .
i get the same benefit of reducing my principal which in turns saves me a tiny bit of interest going forward and building up the overpayment so that i eventually end up paid ahead and have the flexibility to skip a payment if i ever need to for some reason .
i 've got it and it does n't work for me atleast .

from my experience if you 're flying cheap in sea apps like skyscanner and google flights tend to be useless because they do n't include sea budget airlines .
i 've never seen scoot or cebupac as an option palaging straight to cathay or pal .
edit best way to find them is to ask a local .
if you 're flying towards europe try to find a flight from a major airport in the sea/east asia region and then get them separately .

the irony is of course that as the more the eu federalises the less influential britain becomes within the eu because of all the opt outs .
we would n't be in the inner circle of power any longer if we ever were in the first place .
that is why i 've always treated the remainder claims that britain would be more influential inside the eu with sceptism .
look if this is what they 're banking on then i 'll be against it .
for example increasing the sin tax on cigarettes is not the only method being done to discourage smoking .
same case here other projects are being done to alleviate traffic .
admittedly there are other projects but just like solving any other business problem the best approach is always to execute the most impactful most executable least costly and least damaging approach first .
mandating that simple road construction not take more than a year to be done ?
banning public buses that continue to unload in the middle of edsa ?
training the traffic personnel to be better at their jobs ?
so many others in the list that can be done before implementing an approach that again diminishes the living standards of citizens
and you have to forgive me for not being sympathetic to those who ca n't buy luxury vehicles now .

wait is fall on their sword '' like fell off the back of a truck ? ''
i 've always used it to mean that a person should sacrifice themselves for the greater good .
al franken should fall on his sword resign and get the focus onto washington and the president . ''
but your comment makes it sound like the lawyer is being used as sacrifice but just fell on his sword '' .
like it was n't an accident but they made it look like one but everyone knows it 's not .
and while that 's a sentiment with which i probably would 've agreed i was n't conscious of it until i started watching matt 's videos if that makes any sense .

ok. never once have i disagreed with anything you 've had to say about moment arms .
which is literally all you 're talking about all the time .
i 've repeatedly told you they are not relevant because they have nothing to do with what i disagreed with you about .
this is all about your statement that you need to have significant forward knee travel to load the quads .
touch your quad bend you knee to 90 degrees and extend .
you need to increase the moment arm at the knee one way or another .
the fact that you do n't undrrstand such a fundamental and simple concept means you should just keep quiet .
moment arms have absolutely nothing to do with this disagreement .

more specifically it 's like saying that those two books are near future science fiction a specific sub-genre .
they 're both obviously science-fiction there is no question the issue becomes which sub-genre do you slot them into .
each of those two books like most other books in any meta-genre fits into several sub-genre .
i co-slept the first three months and never intended on it .
it was nerve-wracking at first but then we kind of synched up perfectly and i never had an incident where i felt i would have crushed her and as soon as she 'd stir or make a peep i was there to care for her .
it was n't very comfortable for me tbh but i still got good sleep better than had she slept away from me she would n't
that being said have you considered a snuggle nest in your bed ?
it 's kind of like a little barrier so you do n't crush your baby and they have a safe spot to sleep in your bed like a little box .
maybe you could try this and keep it slightly inclined ?

jordan writes a simplistic story based on stereotypes of his own culture but it was written under very heavy influence of his wife who also was his editor so it 's not at all untrue to say that she was a co-author of the story and was one of the primary reaasons why female characters are so prominent in his writing .
the popularity of the series among women also denies your statement completely .
women just like men like to posture as someone they are not in public especially when challenged ... and then they just fall right into their 50 shades bodice rippers love triangle ya fiction or feminist science fiction to make themselves feel better .
there 's no point discussing what they think of themselves .
it 's the anti love-triangle ya bullshit in action .
but in may ways he nailed the specifics of female dynamics very well .
he 's far too lenient on his own sex but women he did well .
probably too well which is why so very often there 's backlash .
women are just hypocrites about how manipulative toxic and hierarchical they are both between themselves and toward men .
and the current feminist-dominated discourse which blames men for everything gets in the way .
even when feminist evolutionary psychologists produce data that indicate that women are more competitive and selfish among themselves than men they have to write conclusions that contradict their findings .

the most pathetic thing is coming from those celebrating the missile that was sit down .

it 's not the same as barrel bombing rebel held markets .
irans support of militia in yemen has meant saudi has reluctantly look to work with israel whilst being on good terms with the us and russia .

i finally figured out that the easiest way to tell if you need to stop and burp during a feeding is if you actually just feel her stomach if it feels hard or extra firm then she probably needs to burp if it 's soft and squishy she 's probably fine .
there 's always an exception to that but it 's a good way to gauge it i do n't bother burping every single time she unlatches bc half the time she just unlatched because she saw something interesting and got distracted for a minute .
usually i just burp her until her stomach does n't feel hard or until i get a good burp or two out of her .
you can do 'running man ' with her too and lay her on her back and move her legs as though she were running or riding a bike it 's been really helpful in de-gassing her too also i wound up having to give up coffee like a week ago bc it seemed like it might be upsetting her stomach and sure enough she 's feeling way better now good luck ! ! !
oh and wrapping her up in a thick blanket instead of a thin swaddle seems like it makes for more effective/comfy burping although i do n't bother with that while she 's eating bc it 's way too hard for her to reach the boob with all that blanket in the way !

he gave me that look the look i used to see so often before he could muster up the courage to tell me he loved me .
he saw that i 've moved past the emotion .
not a word was mentioned regarding the past but that look said it all .
i 'll never ask him what he was feeling tonight because i do n't need it now .

here is the table https i.imgur.com/ggfzjev.png which shows 3 things

2 of opponents each team has lost to with x number of wins
edit here 's the entire cfp top 25 https i.imgur.com/sw565od.png since i got bored
edit 2 i put fbs wins '' on the table but i probably need to clarify since i realized that 's slightly misleading .
it means wins in a game which has at least 1 fbs team .
what that means is teams like the citadel and mercer would show up as 0 win teams .
i left it like this because the data i used from here https www.sports-reference.com/cfb did not have fcs only records and i feel it 's still fairly representative of the value of wins over those teams .
i am currently running with a msi gamer x rx 580 and a air rx vega 64 .
when running the blockchain drivers the rx 580 is normally fine connected to the monitor but if the vega 64 is connected to the monitor the display becomes corrupted .
the screen also gets corrupted on both displays if i connect them both and clone them which makes me think it 's a problem with the driver and not the gpu since only the gpu screen would get corrupted .
does anyone know if the card is getting damaged when this happens ?
i just do n't want to miss out on the blockchain driver cryptonight hashing speed .
had the vega 64 running at 1700 h/s and had n't even overclocked anything yet .
on normal drivers the vega 64 just gets 1100 h/s .

2015 houston f/houston tom herman peach bowl l/peach vs. florida state f/floridastate hired by texas f/texas end of season
2014 boise state f/boisestate bryan harsin fiesta bowl l/fiesta vs. arizona f/arizona still with boise state f/boisestate
out of the coaches that were hired by other teams
scott frost and tom herman was hired after the end of the regular season before their bowl games though the former had chosen to coach for the bowl game .
p.j fleck was hired after the end of the overall season after their bowl game .
tom herman was the only coach to not be hired within the end of the season associated with the ny6 bowl i.e he did n't get hired directly after the 2015 season .
all of the hired coaches spent at least two seasons with their respective programs
and after this season three of these four coaches will be with their alma mater
tom herman graduate assistant at texas under greg davis texas oc/qb coach from 1998-2010 from 1999-2000
p.j fleck is the only coach who does not have any apparent preexisting ties to his current program i.e no preexisting relations with the university of minnesota
when you look into it this kind of pattern seems interesting .
i just did an assignment from a course i 'm doing where you build a random youtube video page and embed the said video in that page .
i tried my best but i got ta admit it took me awfully long to make it like around 10 hours of interrupted chunks in total.. yea ...
before we begin let me state that i 'm pretty much on the hello world '' level so i guess it does n't need to be mentioned that the code is n't responsive .
also i do n't know how a lot of the stuff that 's on the youtube page is done like icons so feel free to disregard the icons that i placed .
the only part where i cheated '' was the like/dislike and share button section where i cropped the picture from the actual youtube page as otherwise it would 've been incredibly ugly .
i also tried to inspect with dev tools as sparingly as possible only checking the font-family font-size etc .
live '' version of the code https htmlpreview.github.io ? https github.com/giorgimg/youtube_embed/blob/master/index.html
mainly i 'd be interested in what you 'd think of the html structure of the page are there any of the elements that i 'm over/under-using is the structure of the page reasonably understandable for you etc .
attached by default despite me setting it to 0 which i could n't for the life of me figure out why and could n't remove it either .
i could n't figure out how to differentiate different pieces of texts in the description style-wise and had to use h4 h3 and p at the same time .
surely there 's a way better method to style multiple pieces of text in a same block without using so many text elements ?
the default margins of some elements were interfering while i was positioning different elements around and i gave them a rule of margin 0 and then set their individual margins in order to position those .
all feedback is appreciated and thanks in advance for your time

i have just purchased this laptop as i was in the market for a new one .
i 'm having second thoughts about it and was just wondering if anyone has used this specific laptop for video editing and what they thought about it ?
i 've read amazing things about it with the occasional faulty laptop .
i need a laptop that 's light and portable as i travel and also commute to school .
i 'm also getting more into photography and eventually want to branch out into videos as well .
the rumors started on some small websites and dark corners of social media however no one believed them the concept seemed too preposterous to exist .
a club where girls and boys of all types of minorities sjws and even some famous faces did depraved and horrific things on command whatever your imagination could cook up they would do happily .
and the selling point was that all of them were hypnotized and did n't know they even worked in the club during their day to day lives .
however after some digging you think you have found the place and know exactly how to get in .
i 'm looking to play around with this idea of a club where all the girls working there are totally hypnotized to obey all the guests with the added bonus that the girls are totally not the types to be working in a place like this .
i have no limits so feel free to go as dark as you like i 'm also really open to just doing some world building based on this setting and working out some of the details of the setting .
looking to upgrade my phone from an iphone 5s but do n't want to stick with apple .
5s is about the right size for me would be ok with a tad bigger .
mostly use my phone for pretty standard phone things like facebook youtube listening to music browsing the internet .
really not too bothered about how good the camera is because i know i 'll barely use it .
long battery life and/or quick charging would be very nice .
not filled my 32gb storage in the past 3 years i 've had the phone so storage wo n't really be an issue .
any price is fine as long as it 's worth it for the phone .
i 'm also looking into getting an amazon echo so any phone that works with that which i hear is pretty much all of them would be good .
currently in the uk and free to change provider .
it 's currently 12 am on a sunday night or monday morning .
have about 4 5 guests over who are all drunk and loud as hell .
the only reason i have n't asked them to be quiet is because there are no classes this week finals .
i 'm not sure if the other girl is friends with her because i never see her nor does she talk to me when we see eachother in the chalet .
it 's incredibly annoying because they 're always drinking and are always obnoxiously loud .
like holy crap i get drinking having fun with friends is a normal university thing but does it have to be every week ? ? ?
there 's also the fact that over this past semester four months they have not cleared out any of the alcohol bottles from the corner of the room counters .
they 've just been piling up there since the beginning .
why is there so many ohmygod is this even normal ?
let 's also add the fact that they never clean .
i mean they do their own dishes take out their own garbage and i think i heard someone sweep maybe once or twice but other than that ?
we have two washrooms one small one with a sink toilet and the bigger one with the shower toilet sink .
i use the smaller one except for when i shower .
not once over the past four months and i mean once have they cleaned their sink or toilet in the larger washroom .
hell they have n't even cleaned the shower i have .
the sink in there is f'n dirty as hell with dust dirt and that tooth paste crap all over the faucet and mirror .
i could but i wanted to see if they would at least one time .
they also leave both of the front doors unlocked 24/7 .
i tried locking them multiple times but no they unlock both and keep it that way .
i can get leaving the door to the stairwell unlocked but why the one that goes directly into our living room ? ? ? ?
i can only hope to god that the campus housing will be able to reassign me to different roommates for the next semester .
i do n't want to be with these people any longer .
right now i 'm using my personal pc to mine bitcoins and i do n't really want to .

nine out of ten allys looking for 1 2 or 4 .
the occasional ad by players looking for new homes but that 's a small minority .
lost some members to attrition burn-out rage at kabam screwing players especially aw too much .
well lots of allys are now short a few and new blood is drying up .
logically when supply becomes hard-limited short of demand the answer must be to downsize .
take any n number of incomplete allys and downsize/merge to form n-1 complete allys .

i have tried converting xlsx to xlsm and applying macros that replace the name of the server but it is n't scaling so i can replace the fqdn in all links for all workbooks in a folder .
okay i apologize if this is the wrong sub for this but i 've been writing and flushing out a story but i genuinely ca n't remember if it is an original idea or if it 's from something i read/watched in my childhood .
does anyone know about a book/manga/comic where the government has created a super soldier type drug that will give you incredible abilities but there is a 100 chance this drug will kill you there 's no way to know when but one day relatively soon you will drop down dead .
the more intense the ability the shorter amount of time you get .
i 'm sorry i 'm not entirely sure if this is the right sub for this question and if it is n't i would appreciate a nudge in the write direction
this is not at all comprehensive but here is a running tally of html tags we have learned .
sorry if this is posted too late for you to use
all html webpages consist of the following three tags html head head body body html .
all content is located within the html html tags .
the only content that can fall outside of these tags and still be of any use is commenting and declaration of doctype .
the head head tag is used to contain invisible but crucial information about the webpage .
titles formatting rules and links to style sheets are just some of the things you might find inside a the head tags .
the body body tag comes after the head tag and contains all the meat '' or structured content of your webpage .
this is the only aspect of the webpage that would be visible in a browser .
the title title tag is used in the head of a webpage .
it is used to create the title that would be visible to a user on the browser tab of a website .
example usage would be title insert title here ! title .
this declared title would be how users may see your page in a search engine or how any person might first understand what your site is about .
headings are made using the h1 h1 to h6 h6 tags .
h1 is the most important heading largest boldest h6 is the least important smallest .
do not use them as a text formatting tool .
some websites use headings for site indexing and some users browse websites based on headings .
this creates an empty line before and after paragraphs automatically and is used mostly for formatting text based information .
this will create a line break new line without starting a new paragraph .
note that br element is what is called an empty html element '' meaning it does not have an end tag .
use the hr tag to create a horizontal line rule on your page .
this is primarily used as a visual element to separate content .
note that hr element is what is called an empty html element '' meaning it does not have an end tag .
use ! to open a comment and to end the comment .
all information contained within the ! will be greyed out and not appear in your website .
note that this only applies to html pages commenting on css pages follows a different format .
the link could be a word group of words or an image that will link directly to another document .
by default when putting your mouse over the hyperlink the cursor will change .
by default links appear as follows unvisited link underlined blue .
active link one you are currently clicking underlined red .
the most common attribute of the a a tag is href '' .
this indicates where the link is pointing or its direction .
the most common type of link works as follows a href '' url '' link text a .
the link text '' aspect can be words images or any other type of html element .
using the target attribute in your link syntax will specify where you want the link to open .
a common target is blank '' which will open the webpage in a new document .
other targets include self '' same page as link as clicked this is default parent '' opens link in the parent frame this is useful in designs that use frames and top '' also useful in frames this opens the link at the top most aspect of the document .
an example of target in use a href '' url '' target '' blank '' link text a
using a mailto link allows your website to directly open an end users primary email client with your specified address in the to '' field .
you can also format a specific email title if you are trying to illicit specific feedback .
example 1 no subject a href '' mailto emailaddress emailprovider send me an email a
example 2 with subject a href '' mailto emailaddress emailprovider ? subject=subject '' send me an email a
define images using the img tag.. note that img element is what is called an empty html element '' meaning it does not have an end tag .
to display the image you must cite its source using the src attribute .
note that the alt attribute is what a user will see if the image does not load correctly or promptly upon a users visit to your page a likely result of a broken image source link or an end user using a screen reader .
it is best to use text that describes the image for clarity 's sake eg .
if your image is of a hot dog use the alt text hot dog '' .
you can adjust the height and width of the image directly in the html markup note that you should probably not use this method to resize your image considering potential stretching and squashing which would create unappealing imagery .
setting the width and height of your image is good practice because it will allocate this space accurately in all views of your website and it will preserve this space automatically during load time preventing your website from changing layout appearance sporadically during loading .
example height and width syntax img src '' url '' alt '' text '' width '' 640 '' height '' 480 '' .
note that the sizes are defined in pixels by default .
there are three types of lists ordered lists ol li li ol unordered lists ul li li ul and definition lists dl dt dd dd dt dl .
by default ordered lists are marked with numbers unordered lists are marked with bullet points and definition lists contain lists of items with descriptions for each item in the list .
later on during formatting it will be of note to recall that unordered lists no numbers or descriptors are used in building menus with css formatting cues .
a table is divided into rows using the tr tr tag .
the table is further divided row by row using data cells created by the td td tag .
you can remember the td tag as table data '' as it holds all content of a data cell .
a td td tag is capable of containing text links images lists forms other tables etc .
most of the time you want borders to show .
this will be covered more extensively in the css for tables .
prior to html5 you might use the border attribute in tables but this is no longer supported .
you can add headers to your table rows using the th th tag .
all major browsers format the th th tag as bold and centered .
the div div tag defines a division or section of an html document .
divs are frequently used with css as they are a great way to contain specific content and assign it css parameters .
the div is also a good way to keep your html neat and organized .
it is of note that browsers automatically place a linebreak before and after div elements however you can remove this in css rules .
there are many special characters in html that can display things like symbols non-breaking spaces hex numbers or other non-conventional-text characters .
all special characters begin with an ampersand and end in a semi-colon .
the id attribute can be attached to almost any element and is used mostly for formatting css rules .
the attribute is used as follows id '' test '' .
this would create an id of test '' to be used in the specific element you have added the attribute to .
this can get very complex but in the most basic sense it is creating a unique identifier for a specific element .
similar to the id attribute the class attribute can be attached to almost any element and is mostly used for formatting css rules .
the attribute is used as follows class '' test '' .
this would create a class of test '' to be used in the specific element you have added the attribute to .
you would prefer to use a class instead of an id if you were preparing for format several elements of your website at a time .
note that you can use a class and an id in the same element allowing you to apply both generic attributes and specific attributes for very detailed customization of your webpage .
using the html tag span span allows a user to edit css or javascript directly in the middle of a line of text without having to set any previous parameters .
syntax as follows p hello my name is span style '' color red '' santa clause span .
this would color the content within the span using css color formatting covered in css tags
the navigator is used to build your menu on your webpage .
the nav is usually the same across various pages and screen readers can understand to skip the nav content .
navigation menus are commonly built using unordered lists ul .
most of the crucial formatting of this html element is done in css .
the header header tag of a website is where you might see the first chunk of content or perhaps the name of a website and its banner .
the header is the top eye-catching content a user might see .
most of the crucial formatting of this html element is done in css .
a section section tag allows you to define a section of your website .
this is often used together with an id or a class formatting primary content on your website to appear uniform throughout a users browsing experience .
an example of that syntax would be section id '' content '' content here section .
the aside aside tag is essentially a secondary section box .
this is used often for sidebar menus containing things such as links or other non-primary content .
it is helpful to put your secondary content in an aside due to the css formatting options it allows eg .
the footer footer tag usually contains information about the document or webpage is it at the bottom of .
you always find a footer at the bottom of a page .
it frequently shares the copyright information the creator of the website relevant dates or years contact information site maps or other non-crucial content .
most of the crucial formatting of this element is done in css .
so with pokemon go now using osm i thought i 'd spend some time improving my local area but i have a few questions
if i put areas around single family homes should i do anything other than tag them building house and building_1 residential ?
is it a problem if i put areas around a lot of houses in a relatively small area ?
in an area that 's had recentish development the streams/lakes are completely gone any issue with just deleting them completely .
what about places where i ca n't see any trace of the stream in the satellite view ?
for stores i 've just put a commercial area around them and put in their name .
is that useful should i make sure i always include some other tags ?
all my settings are low yet this happens regularly .
nothing has changed yet this bullshit destroys winnable games for me .
i 'm supposed to be learning the present passive system of the third and fourth conjugation verbs and y'all are distracting me
i recently decided to get a small jbj rimless desktop 6 gallon curved glass aquarium w led light .
while setting it up the driftwood piece i put in shifted as i added water .
i tried to move things around as best i could but every move i made made it worse .
i now have an aquarium with black water and no idea how to get things to settle down .
i have a couple of small plants i just planted in there and am scared they will die .
i 'm also running the filter with the powerhead facing the surface .
okay so i 've recently started researching more about fallout new vegas because even though i 've played it many times i know there are some things i 've missed i played the game about 4 times had bought fallout 3 and played it like 3 times before i found out there was enclave in fallout new vegas so i 'm going back to play it again .
so back to topic i found out that there is .223 ammo in fallout new vegas which i did n't know before .
people have said it 's great for hunting animal prey and i want to ask how many of you actually hunt in fallout ?
i know that i never did in fallout new vegas .
i occasionally hunted in fallout 3 but whenever a yao guai sneaks up on you it loses its luster .
in fallout 4 i 've hunted properly a little but it 's not as fun when your radstag just runs away .
so do any of you hunt in fallout new vegas ?
i plan on doing it when i replay and plan on buying .223 rounds .
on december 5 2017 robert stanson gave a lecture on efree 's talkshow show .
talkshoe does not disclose the number of people in the audience .
robert stanson 's youtube videos have very few views despite being interviewed by efree and reviewed by the liberty beacon .
very low viewers of robert stanson 's youtube videos evidences how few tis participate in efree 's talkshoe shows and how few tis are interested in shielding .
i know first hand how frustrating it is to spend tremendous time researching developing and testing shielding for oneself and others and have it ignored .
i emailed asking him to explain reverse polarity on reddit .
4 how to make the reverse polarity magnet helmet .
5 targeted individual shielding blocking the ears from v2k .
6 targeted individuals reverse polarity magnet helmet published on november 19 2017 .
big 5 sporting store sells children 's and adult 's baseball batter helmets .
so robert switched to magnets with a hole in the center as they can be riveted .
magneto 4 helmet used 120 1 inch x 1/4 '' depth cms n52 magnets with a 10 screw hole and counter sunk by cms on ebay.com .
magneto 5 helmet has thinner magnets spread 1/4 inch apart from each other .
initially robert used these magnets but they kept breaking .
20 mm x 3 mm hole 4 mm ring round neodymium permanent magnets n52
use stanley rivets 1/2 '' x 3/16 for the magnets from ebay .
robert switched to more durable magnets sold by applied magnets .
robert stated these magnets use a different size rivet but did n't specify the size .
to cover two ear holes in the baseball helmet use a rubber packing sheet .
lowe 's sells two manufacturers ' rubber packing sheets .

i did n't get to watch and summarize the videos as i was knocked out twice at the library .
several nights ago i was knocked out while submitting papers on silica nanoparticles .
knocking out has become a main tactic of person to sleep .
the next morning my brain still felt the effects of being knocked out .
after being knocked out my head is strongly pulsed including my eyes .
during the daytime the brain is slightly continous wave zapped to induce a headache migraine and disorientation .
while knocked out the torturers increase the power of brain zapping and change from continuous wave to pulsing .
i can not lie down with my head inside a wet clay crate .
i am knocked out so often i considered submitting a torture report solely on dates places and what activity i was doing prior to being knocked out .
how to shield being knocked out and brain zapped while in an upright position ?
last year i tested strong neodymium magnets inside and outside of my steel wwii helmet .
the magnets barely reduced the brain zapping while i slept .
i had not tested the magnets during the daytime .
the steel helmet and magnets were too heavy to wear while my body was upright .
robert tested a lighter helmet but did n't disclose the weight .
can magnets shield the lighter brain zapping when tis are upright ?
often after being knocked out i am too out of it to reddit or drive safely .
i need more to distract me from the homework i 'm not doing
i 'm very new to minimalism and was wondering if anyone had some tips to starting out .
i 've gotten rid of all the clothes that were easy to part with but i still have waaaay too many .
what are some good methods of getting rid of clothing ?

say i want to pay everyone in my company ten times what they 're worth on the market .
and once i do that can i keep it secret to the outside world excepting regulating authorities-e.g .
if not to what extent can i do that how many people can i pay that way how much can i overpay them ?
what would be the safest policy on that going by the numbers/percentages ?
the secrecy is not crucial for this thought experiment and can be dispensed with .

is this surge of commits that we are seeing from frost or just the time of year .
so i am looking for this youtube video for a couple years now .
it is three people in a dimly lit room that fight with light sabers the video was pretty good quality and it started with them fighting with lightsabers guy as darth maul vs qui gon and obi wan .
the qui dies and obi starts going hard on darth maul .
then obi slashes darths saber in two and darth starts doing flips and gymnastics with his dual wield sabers .
the video was professionally edited so it 's no some kids just reenacting and it 's title was something like lightsaber battle so as time continues the search gets harder as more recent videos are made with the name
it was a one time thing in all the years we 've been together .
but some of the details make me want to throw up .
like that it was a random stranger with no protection in a hallway at a party .
do i try to work through it or not ?
is it possible ever to rebuild a healthy relationship after that ?
also i have a lot of the symptoms of ptsd .
is there treatment or something for ptsd-like-symptoms caused by cheating ?

im having second thoughts if i should get xc 2 because of how i treated the first xenoblade chrobicles one on wii and 3ds i got bored of it probably because of the grinding i stopped playing midway telethia part and never went back .
i am a fan of jrpg 's but man im scared that i might not finish xc 2 on like how i didnt finish xc 1 what should i do ?
i spent about the entire week on a vyvanse binge but it was the last stretch that got me .
24 hours and having not slept for days i went full psycho .
i even watched two buildings have a conversation about what i do n't know .
however i still feel paranoid and see things in the corner of my eye .
edit i feel like i 'm still on speed but only the negative effects .
the legend of zelda breath of the wild part 4
i 'm getting to that point where i have my armor and weapon to sr and rare type but have n't touched the accessories as i do n't really know best way to level them .
any one could maybe point me or explain to me the best way to go about level and upgrading desired accessory set ?
i want to go for a black core but some pieces only as c. should i be combining or just upgrading ?
also i 'm new to reddit so i do n't know how to edit pretty posts yet .
so i was quite bored and noticed i liked way more the 'during combat ' buffs and thought it would be a good idea to hypothesize some new skills .
while at it i will link them to some characters i believe would fit having those effects .
i also tried to not powercreep too much but if you think otherwise feel free to comment on it haha .
i made those skills while thinking they could be prf since their effects with matching stat distribution can be really strong .
so anyway donnel is already on the game but he could get a seasonal variant and have one of these skills wishful thinking .
swift underdog on original donnel would be pretty awesome .
if only he was n't released at day 1. well .
nino sophia and others would probably fit the 'underdog ' definition too .
fierce underdog if unit 's atk foe 's atk 1 unit and foe 's atk are equated during combat .
sturdy underdog if unit 's def foe 's def 1 unit and foe 's def are equated during combat .
swift underdog if unit 's spd foe 's spd 1 unit and foe 's spd are equated during combat .
warding underdog if unit 's res foe 's res 1 unit and foe 's res are equated during combat .
with those skills i actually thought about a lot of characters that fit their names so i will talk about them after each one .
ambusher vow 3 grants atk/spd+5 during combat if no ally is within 2 spaces .
infiltrator vow 3 grants def/res+5 during combat if no ally is within 2 spaces .
leila from fe7 would fit these skills so much but have npcs been added to heroes yet ?
i think leila is more of a infiltrator type since she used to gather informations .
virion and cherche could probably be nearing this definition ?
but i do n't think awakening had any unit doing spy-work .
death vow 3 grants atk+8 during combat if initiating combat and foe 's hp 100 .
life vow 3 grants def/res+7 during combat if this unit is attacked and unit 's hp 100 .
characters who have lust for killing and the counter-part to them who wishes to stay alive no matter what .
the first skill would probably fit fire emblem villains and some characters like jaffar while the latter i ca n't think of anyone but probably there are characters out there maybe lachesis ?
charging vow 3 grants atk/spd+4 to allies within 2 spaces during combat if ally 's hp 100 .
patrolling vow 3 grants def/res+4 to allies within 2 spaces during combat if ally 's hp 100 .
in a game about armies you would think some of the skills would have been tied to tactics but as far as i can tell none of them are .
both of these skills could probably be in any character .
they are sidegrades to goad/ward with hp restriction instead of movement type .
friendship vow 3 grants def/res+6 to adjacent allies during combat if ally 's hp 100 .
leadership vow 3 grants atk/spd+6 to adjacent allies during combat if ally 's hp 100 .
both of these skills belong with ike but much more friendship vow .
ike sees his friends dying not on 100 hp and immediately thinks i fight for my friends you guys ca n't die or i 'm meaningless '' anyway maybe a little too selfish to be him .
interesting things would happen if you match those skills with bonds life vow or ddef/cdef .
tactician vow grants atk/spd/def/res+2 to allies within 2 spaces during combat .
a possible skill to a seasonal buff-robin or mark or any tactician in fe history .
also obviously prf due to being as powerfull as urór imo .
since i have n't played a lot of fire emblem main games just fe6/7/13 recently and fe8 a long time ago i do n't quite know all the characters personalities so feel free to comment on which character would fit getting one of these skills if you want to .
things will be exaggerated but based on true events !
do n't bother messaging me if you 're going to claim that certain things are n't true i love going over the top !
also i love when guys insult my looks too !
my boyfriend and i have been together for about 4 years now .
he 's a total sweetheart always buying me things being gentlemanly .
in the 4 years we 've been together i 've never so much as given him a handjob .
as far as he knows that 's because i want to save myself for marriage '' .
i even managed to convince him to put a chastity cage on so i could be sure he was n't jerking off since i told him that 's basically cheating .
of course what he doesn't know is that i 've been fucking and sucking literally any guy i can the entire time we 've been together .
i lecture him when he so much as looks at my cleavage but then i 'll let the kids that pick on him stick their dick in it when he 's not around !
i especially love cheating on him with guys that are mean to him and to me too !
so pm me if you want to hear some stories and laugh at him with me !
i 'll give you a non-nude shot of my cleavage too so you can understand how hard it is for him being teased all the time !
i 'm just lonely and usually when guys reply they 're either assholes or flirters .
milfs are my faaaavourite and a dom is wonderful whether rough or gentle .

i just got elven gilded armor from jarl balgruuf for telling him about the dragon attack at helgen which seemed odd .
so i fired up tes5edit and had a look to see if the quest reward or leveled list was getting trampled by another mod but it all looks fine from what i can tell which obviously means i 'm wrong and missing something .
the only plugin that is touching mq102 after legendary bugsmasher edition is betterquestobjectives-requiempatch.esp and it has the same leveled lists for the rewards as requiem aa000xarrianmq102reward .
checked the entry for that leveled list and it is n't being modified by any plugins .
edit found this on line 239 of qf_mq102_0004e50d.psc in usleep
perhaps this is overriding the .esp data but it seems odd that i have n't seen anyone else notice this .
update i decided to try starting a new game with a much smaller load order to see if the issue would still present itself .
this time i only ran usleep unofficial high res patch nlva vivid weathers assets requiem and fozar 's requiem-db patch .
still received an armour instead of the flawless amethyst from balgruuf .
i guess it 's just a bug with requiem itself ?
final update/resolved dumb mistake on my part i was using a savegame that i had created just after the wagon ride into helgen with no mods installed intended to bypass glitches with mods initializing too soon .
i guess this was letting the mq102 script start where requiem normally bypasses it .
got the correct item after starting a brand new game with requiem active .

the liberate the bounty mission with the electric turbine camp and the cave systems if by far my most frustrating mission in the bounty system .
air dropped targets can appear in the caves drill orbital pods ? !
if you do not kill these enemies within 15 seconds of them spawning you fail the entire bounty .
you can not restart the liberation or regain control but you fail entirely .
if you parkour your way through the caves trying to find enemies and come up dry you have failed the bounty because by the time you come out some squatter on the far side of the region has captured the camp . ''
also not all the enemies in the location are part of the camp liberation !
if there were additional enemies in the camp prior to taking out the first several to clear the area '' those are just additional fodder to distract you from the real camp targets .
it 's the most disatisfying part of the bounty system currently imo .
if you have lost all control of the region then the timer should freeze not fail the mission .
i understand this might make the bounty close to unfailable but it still retains the core concept of the liberation .
also targets should be separated in the liberation between random plains enemies and actual enemies that count towards the liberation timer .
finally do n't let air dropped targets spawn underground actually not sure if that 's been patched but it was frustrating prior to plague star pc .
some of the defense terminals also stink because you ca n't see through the bushes right next to the terminal .
basolk teleporters and jetpack hammer wielders easily sneak through the brush but are less of an annoyance .

i 'm a seasoned smash 4 player and i 'm trying to get into melee so i 'm a beginner in this context although definitely not new to smash and i 've always been able to play smash without worrying about the automatic function of jumping that occurs if i tilt the control stick up too far so i 've developed my playstyle into being able to use the control stick for all my aerials which is manageable with melee now except for up air and being able to up-tilt without having to worry about accidentally jumping so basically smash 4 's input leniency lets me smash the control stick in whatever direction i choose to give me the exact input that i want as opposed to having to be conscious about the amount of force that i apply onto the control stick with my thumb .
i know it may sound awkward to play like that to you melee players but i actually perform well in tournament so trust me it 's alright .
aaanyways so while i was practicing i noticed that as a result i ca n't do my aerials correctly because i 'll always jump and then up-air and that i have to be super conscious about the force applied onto the stick when i up-tilt .
i even even have to pay extra attention to when i 'm offstage and i want to recover i usually hold up before i press b when i play smash 4 so now i recover really awkwardly in melee because as a result i 'm constantly hopping slightly and then pressing up-b so i end up a little over than where i want to be on the stage .
so i found myself in a predicament i know i can go ahead and get used to using the c-stick just fine but it seems really awkward and slow to have to transition from y to the control stick and a for nairs as well and using the control stick will make it so that i ca n't up-air correctly .
i can definitely get used to up-tilts and proper up-b recoveries eventually though so my real dilemma here is my aerials .
now my question is what 's the optimal way to play melee and hold the controller regarding aerial inputs ?
should i just use the c-stick like i have been using it but just apply less force when i attempt to perform an aerial and get used to playing like that ?
or maybe that but using the c-stick for up-airs ?
or maybe i should just straight up use the c-stick for all aerials and just practice the transition speed of my thumb regarding y a and the c-stick ?
i do n't know how to proceed with learning melee before i deal with the peculiarities of this problem .
tl dr how does a smash 4 pleb get used to tap jump in melee ?

you have a giant crush on me and figure that i ca n't ignore you if you 're wearing the right outfit
we 're roommates/friends and you ask for my opinion on something new you bought .
or i just come home to find you trying something on .
feel free to suggest things more outlandish than what i have here
just trying to decide if i want to purchase re1 or re2 .
i 've only ever played re7 biohazard and never really had an interest in the series .
would it be worth it for me to get the switch ports ?
is the quality between revelation 1 and 2 different ?
is the 2nd one better quality because it 's newer '' ?
would i understand the 2nd one if ive never played the 1st one ?
people complain that hanzo 's scatter arrow is annoying .
while it definitely is at least scatter arrow takes some semblance of skill to use and plan emphasis on some .
with the concussion mines all i ever see junkrat players do with it is not use it to get around the map or use it in conjunction with their traps but instead as a crutchy instant 120 damage at close range .
maybe just decreasing the damage of the mine in the air 60-80 is fine or just making it so that it can only be detonated once it hits a surface will make junkrat feel much less annoying to play against while still making him feel good to play .
ughhh seriously who is being allowed to write these films ?
this is practically a plagiarised carbon copy of the scene from jurassic park where dr grant and the kids hide behind a log so they are n't crushed .
whoever 's making these films they are completely sub par and lack all imagination should just come out and admit it 's easier to just copy spielberg 's work in a really shitty way than make their own .
a hero damage proc will trigger right after an initial one.. like for example 2 sportacus after zombie trick.. but because the first one procs full shield the second one does n't deal any damage because the shield animation of going back to empty is still happening .
on a side note it 's been 4 months since i 've played and i thought they 'd fix this by now if it is a bug .
aside from the cringe in coming back to play an ea game you know.. cause darth vader i have to say..
but the amount of in game purchases is astounding.. selling bundles now ?
and cliche peas cost 1 more sun for each you play ?
planetside 1 had the lodestar mechas and actual liberator-bombers .
currently planetside 2 lacks a heavy transport in the lodestar form and lacks an air unit capable of actually bombing .
right now what we have are glorified strike craft .
esf 's have rockets which are mediocre at best libs are gunships with restricted patterns .
id be fine with a designated bomber aircraft like a slimmer and faster liberator that was capable of dropping bombs think of the russian pe-2 but was vulnerable to attack from pretty much anything that can shoot it .
it 'd have flares and whatnot but no turrets .
maybe a single offset frontal rotary from the reaver but its maneuverability would make it so that the gun would be a last resort or a head-on deterrent .
for the mechas i feel like they could provide an ultimate vehicle of some sort .
it 'd cost the full amount of nanites to deploy it 'd be much slower than the mbts and limited in turn speed but would have extremely powerful guns and turret position capable of handling several mbt 's .
but due to a limited cone of fire and the turret being higher up they could be flanked by infantry and taken out by any group with a brain of some sort .
obviously it 'd have a very high shield and health amount equivalent to maybe 2.5x that of an mbt .
shit maybe even require certs to unlock to prevent general zerging .
for the lodestar i propose something resembeling a galaxy but modified for the carrying ability of vehicles that with the massive amount of vehicles that are pulled now would be capable of carrying several mbt 's in different slots maybe up to a maximum of 3 2 under wings and 1 under tail .
it 'd look like a skycrane version of a galaxy .
i mean the game just needs a general makeover but i feel these could be other additions .
shit maybe even add a medium land transport like an in-between of a harasser and a sunderer capable of carrying maybe 5-6 people slower than a harasser but faster than a sunderer like the equivalent of a halftrack or some shit .
i 've just started season 2 as of this post .
it 's a toss up whether i enjoy the accents or the show more .
please use this thread to discuss anything you 'd like !
okay this was one of the most bizarre stories i have came across in the nosleep collection and i have never been able to find it again .
a very strange man decides to uh there 's no delicate way to say this jizz into his house plant .
turns out the house plant gets pregnant and can communicate with the dude and they have little plant babies that can talk with him too .
anyways it ends with his roommate knocking over his plant wife/kids and they all shrivel up and die .
this story made me say what the fuck '' at least 20 times and despite how fucking weird it was i absolutely could not stop reading .
i need to get my hands on this stage ass story so if you know how to locate it please let me know .
how have we not discussed that bahtman and annie will be living in a fire station ?
did chris not tell bm that 's where they would be ?
i do n't blame annie for being po 'd .
i also do n't think he has money hidden in the us as stated below in some spilled tea because he would be taking them to a motel 6 if he had any .
need info on traveling to revelstoke for the first time ?
for new and experienced snowboarders with any questions at all about snowboarding including gear learning what to wear where to go what terminplogy is rad etc .
please ask questions in this thread and let the r/snowboarding community help out .
this is meant as a judgement-free and welcoming environment for noobs to ask any kind of question related to snowboarding no matter how dumb it may seem .
i 've seen this sentiment on so many forums .
you actually think he gets by ct leroy zach and any of those other big guys in those eliminations when he could n't even score a point on gawky nerdic chet in balls in ?
he had a chance to win fa the way johnny and reilly did but people saying that he was the favorite are funny
i feel like the early seasons of this show were so amazing largely due to the fact that it all felt so real .
it was thrilling because the kids were getting into more trouble back and the crazy stuff happening never seemed far-fetched for southsiders or anyone in that environment .
the early seasons ' plotlines were easier to connect with and shocking because they 're so wild yet still realistic .
it felt like a wake-up call to those of us who do n't live the same life as the characters .
now i know i 'm probably holding an unpopular opinion here but recently it seems like things that are going on in the characters ' lives are much less realistic making it a little difficult to really connect with the show .
bianca the doctor who treated frank after he was shot being so drawn to frank
i just do n't ever see any doctor or well-established individual going on a crazy binge with a guy like frank in real life .
even if he/she does choose to live carelessly for a while they 'd probably find friends or people they trust to do it with .
frank drawing in a woman like her seems pretty unrealistic and too quick and easy .
it worked in earlier seasons with women like sheila because well it was sheila .
she was not bright and she was highly delusional along with socially awkward .
frank saw his opportunity with sheila and took it .
we repeatedly saw frank get shut down by other women in earlier seasons which made sense and really added to his character .
it feels like the writers are all of a sudden trying to convince us that frank 's naturally intelligent and influential by portraying other characters as unsuitably unintelligent .
liam being admitted to a high-profile private school just because he 's black .
the school could 've admitted literally any black kid who came from at least a decent background .
this is what schools would prefer in order to avoid any trouble that seemingly come from students of poor socioeconomic status yet this school chose to admit a child who comes from a household without stable income or strong familial support .
no school would ignore liam 's circumstances especially not a private school .
again frank being able to convince a private school to admit liam happened because the writers made the principal too easily influenced .
frank may be the hands-on guy and eloquent but again those women from liam 's school could find that almost anywhere with a guy who is at least younger and more attractive .
carl conveniently having the guy he kidnapped/detoxed come back to him with 5k in cash and offering more
i understand the story behind carl 's situation and i actually do enjoy it .
however if i 'm being unbiased i have to admit this also just feels so unrealistic and too convenient .
the characters feel like family at this point and the script-writing is still very well done .
it is still just as fun watching the characters make their way up in the world and i love seeing the character development for each one .
i just wanted to see if anybody else feels the same way about recent seasons being a little less realistic than what we were used to from earlier .
do dragons print their own newspapers or film movies and shows specifically for dragons ?
when humans write fantasy novels will dragons be included by default ?
would excluding them from fantasy worlds be offensive or would dragons do the same ?
would dragons still be portrayed as monsters in film or would that be racist ?
would books like the hobbit eragon and such still be written ?
so we just came back from a great time in vegas like always !
we flew in friday and we took an uber to our hotel .
on our way he made small talk asking what our plans were .
he suggested buying alcohol at a cheaper liquor store on our way .
at that time of excitement we said hell yeah and went .
we decided to buy a bottle and did n't really think much of it .
we snapped out of it at the hotel and realized that we might have overpaid for the bottle .
does anyone know of these uber drivers are steering customers to these liquor stores and receiving some kind of cash kickback on the back end ?
i know this may sound a bit strange to some but i really enjoy collecting playing cards .
i like to use them for card magic and also playing poker and other card games but there is something about collecting that is really fun !
if you also like collecting maybe we can start a group chat on facebook or something ?
i 'm rather new to this reddit thing so please bear with me if this goes too long by normal reddit standards .
so i was recording some let 's play content for my youtube channel specifically of the game lego star wars the complete saga .
as i was rambling trying to come up with something to say i suddenly had an idea tt games is most likely going to make a lego version of star wars episodes viii and ix .
so what if after ix hits theaters they release a new version of the complete saga but updated to the newer style and going through all the main movies those being the numbered episodes .
profitable dlc could be anthology films and the ryan johnson trilogy .
i do n't know if it 'll ever happen but i do know that i 'd buy a copy .
though considering they did n't and wo n't ever finish lego the hobbit i ca n't really see it happening unless a ton of people wanted it .
matt bliss came into the tank with his product the modern christmas tree '' asking 100k for 10 of their company .
barbara offered 100k for 25 with a royalty of 5 per tree until her costs are recouped .
kevin undercut barbara and offered the same deal for 20 .
barbara first matched kevin 's bid then offered 19 .
matt countered at 15 to which barbara responded with 18 and they settled .
between polaroids the wall their relationship and their history there 's something big we 're missing .
they know each other and are closer than just my brother and you are friends so i guess i can talk with you sometimes close which yeah may attribute to them just being friends but what 's the purpose ?
there 's incongruity with darlene 's interaction with elliot as well .
yes she is active in his life but the timing is extremely careful .
she shows up when his illness is intense beginning of ‘do n't delete me ' when he slips into mr robot mode in s1 when shaila dies when elliot goes missing after the 71 attack 's after 5/9 during big hacks ... . on top of that each of these times she 's usually interacting w angela even when they found elliot at the cemetery they were together .
she was caught by dom not long after angela 's interaction with the fbi and there 's a reason .
not to mention the fact that she was n't in times square and made a point of never being back here around their mother but is avidly around mr robot and mimics personality traits .
if she hates their mother more than elliot it 's safe to assume she would n't stay around her much .
do you guys think it 's possible she 's another figment if elliot 's mental illness ?
or is there any other weight/tie between angela 's presence darlene 's lifehood ?
my skin is pretty weird and gets dry pretty fast but can also develop acne pretty fast mainly around my nose and chin areas .
what 's a good face wash that can tackle that issue but is also alcohol-free and preferably good at removing makeup ?
on my fifth week of 40mg/day now and the dryness is imposible to keep in check i am using lotion 2-4 times a day drink lots of water yet face gets super flakey and my neck is developing huge red rashes .
been having problems after successfully making a running and walking code but now when i run into a wall i just go straight through it but when i walk nothing happens as supposed to .
just wanted to say hello really and see if anyone has any tips or tricks for me .

i started to get into all of this because i have an anxiety disorder and periods of depression .

i 'm trying to help friend fix their xbox one .
i 've used a usb to completely recover the console using this file
ive signed in as different people to determine if its a ban or not .
the behaviour is different from anything i 've seen so far with a broken xbox .
everything in the menu works after a reset even the store .
after the store updates itself the store no longer works .
disc based games will update via the web and will start from the disc .
downloaded games from the store while its working will not load at all .
it gives an error message about needing to be connected to the xbox live service but we are connected because we signed in and we downloaded a game .
the network test shows everything is fine i have tried alternative 8.8.8.8 dns settings in case the isp is wrong .
i 'm completely stumped has anybody else encountered this problem ?
have you got any more ideas on what to try ?
the new sr change makes it so you get closer ranked teams to your sr. sure it takes a little longer about 6/7mins instead of 3/4 but games are always 3.6 compared to 3.3 or even 3.2 games .
just wanted to say thanks and see if anyone else feels the same .
just seen this tweet from mr.blamo .. '' anyone following lg because of me i 'd recomemmend removing it nothing but yt addons jen hookers ''
you can uninstall lg repo but leave ds and then install the new ds on top
i know there is n't enough of a player base to support the 3 modes solo/duo/squad .
but is there a chance we could alternate between duo and squad queues ?
maybe on a daily or weekly basis ... open to ideas here .
would really like to try duos out i 've had a string of bad luck with squads where 1-2 players do n't have mics and want to do their own thing .
i feel duos would reduce this somewhat but still keep the enjoyment of team based play and not split the smaller community .
i want something to satisfy my monster hunter itch before world comes out but i 'd like a more traditional jrpg .

i was studying philosophy and yoga seemed like a great outlet for me.i truly enjoy the practice and philosophy. the culture '' has some serious self reflecting to do .
diversity and acceptance is preached a lot but a quick look around the studio and on the covers of your popular yoga blogs and outlets tell a different story .
insta yogi 's '' and just referring to oneself as a yogi '' just seems strange to me given what it actually entails to become a yogi .
i do n't enjoy being around the fad of yoga .
when i do practice at a studio i get to be me and not worry about the poses or the people because the poses and people do n't matter .
i 've never actually stopped to wonder about what other people think mostly because i do n't really pay attention to anyone else .
i just breath and go along with my flow .
op if you 're a teacher trying to start up a class its not a bad idea .
a less formal class would probably do well for beginners and people not trying to take yoga too seriously .
even though teachers say it 's your flow go at your own pace etc . ''
mostly everyone will try to keep up with the teachers flow or just naturally sink up with the flow of the class regardless if their form is sacrificed .
offering a space to just move and be a misfit '' could totally appeal so some people .
... and if it falls off that would be a red flag .

i tiamat style item is pretty op for ranged champs .
back at the end of season 5 guinsoos rageblade offered a tiamat auto at full stacks and was abused heavily by ranged cjamps like kog that could get 5.0 attack speed at the time .
it was so powerful that riot had to rework the item completely so it had the devourer passive instead of tiamat passive on the item at full stacks .
also the item that you describe as only having the auto reset tiamat has already been made .
tiamat for the majority of swason 5 was reworked to only have the active and did n't aoe targets with every auto .
this was very underwelming and was a pretty big nerf to bruisers like riven and fiora so riot unded the tiamat rework to what it is now .

aggregate dedup is only for aff flash systems at this time .
one way of looking at this concern would be to remember that all data access is controlled by ontap .
disk io and aggregates are also controlled by ontap and each controller knows about its volumes .
the cluster then has a record of all the volumes in the cluster .
access to volumes on there are controlled by svms .
so to simplify this when a svm wants to read/write data the data is written to disk by a process outside of the svm and that process decides if the data is already present or if it needs to be written again on the basis of shared aggregate level metadata .
this process will be transparent to the svm administrator .

you can get software to emulate it razor or logitech have software for this but since this software is external the sound will be slightly delayed since it has to be modulated first the worst case was rainbow six siege in which it took up to 2 seconds to modulate the sound and the soundlevels will be fucked up .

most homeless people are n't going to pay 10 cents for a stupid plastic bag .
most homeless people were n't going in to the grocery store to get the bags when they were free .
hell i 've seen the security guard in front of stores turn away homeless people away trying to come in if you are at the shitting in a plastic bag '' point you not likely welcome in any of your local stores .
people throw the bags away and they get fished out of the trash .
i do n't know if you live out here but it 's easy enough to look at the lines of people checking out to see that people are still using just as many of the plastic bags now even though they charge 10 cents each it 's not enough of a charge to have made any real impact on people 's behavior .

ending with calm your titties '' is probably not a great way to curry favor or get people to embrace your point of view either .
or just keep clapping louder to cover for the rest of us .
you need rebounding wayy more than threes and steals so randle 's needed honestly and plus wesley gon na lose so much value with gallo coming back anyways .
i 'll have to keep an eye out for the gomez kid nice information though .
we only had 1 timeout left but i agree we gave up
i know that i personally connected with a lot of what you had to say as i come from the same experiences .
i have also been a big fan of video games as they felt like a true escape from everything i was going through growing up and i have always had a wild imagination and the fantasy aspect really appeals to me .
while i was never allowed to be a big part of them growing up one of my best friends during my freshman year of college introduced me to league and i fell in love instantly .
it was everything i had always looked for in a video game and never found .
i became super passionate something that could come across as obsession i guess and it always seemed a little weird around my group of friends that played league because while they just played it to pass time it became a very steady and constant thing for me that just made me so happy .
i always felt weird bringing up league and my mains and experiences in everything when they would delve into fifa or call of duty or anything because it just was n't something they took as seriously .
this video was just another realization of my love for the game the community and every aspect of league .
i completely agree with everything you had to say and am happy that the video provided a positive response for you as well .

probably smoother than 90 percent of the other workers even in her cruise control mode though .
i saw it and thought this is too expensive and its limitations are too great .
but i spent a couple of months trying to build decks and make exodia hunter work and it was fun despite the bad win rate .
when it worked the payoff had great meme value filling my board with 3-4 krushes in a turn .
it suggests a secret deck but i ca n't play it with putricide .
it suggests a big spell deck but i ca n't play it with k c 's neutral minions that revolve around big spells like grand archivist .
its conditions stifle deckbuilding rather than promoting ingenuity the way highlander cards do .
when its conditions are met the payoff is mild unless you rng a couple of leokks after dropping a greater emerald spellstone or you consider chaining animal companions into to my sides into calls of the wild to be its own reward .
i respect that every expansion can not be straight power creep .
but i consider it disingenuous to print shit cards charge money for them and only make them useful in the next expansion or the third next expansion or never .

audio is decoded first from flac/mp3/~~aac before being sent to bt which then uses its own compression .

do you seriously want aliens to invade earth and take over so that they can enforce their morals on us ?
i have to ask are you trolling me or are you just that stupid ?
no my point is that you can not say that we do have a moral obligation to intervene on behalf of another human but not on behalf of an animal .
the idea that we send police officers to prevent animal on animal rape is genuinely hilarious .
it 's so stupid i can hardly believe it .
never did i state that we should do that police officers obviously have more important things to worry about .
but if we had infinite resources would preventing animal rape be a good thing ?
yeah i know but if you do it like that the law is vague rather than clear .
the point of a hierarchical organization is to make it absolutely clear who outranks whom in a system like this this becomes vague .
how long does it take before an officer can order a noncom to do something ?
but that does n't explain why you did n't throw explosives instead .

too much deregulation gives corporations permission to screw over consumers and their competition .
if you like monopolies and consolidating more wealth and power in the hands of a few then getting rid of net neutrality makes sense .

the scale of the reactor determines the fuel because the probability that a neutron will interact with another uranium nucleus is dependent on the depth of uranium they pass through .
with smaller reactors there 's less fuel for a neutron to pass through so a higher proportion of u-235 in the fuel is needed to sustain a chain reaction .

i also met taylor through nova 's red room but back at the one she did on november 28th 2012 .
there was only around 20 people there and we went to the nova headquarters .
she was out promoting red and she sang wanegbt and i knew you were trouble .
she was so genuine and kind and complimented me on my headband i was wearing .
i had a letter for her which she gladly took and we spoke about the weather and other casual things .
i also was able to tell her how much she meant to me which was great .
then we took some photos and she gave us another hug and then as we were leaving she called out that she hoped to meet us again after a show one day .
it was an amazing experience and something i will never forget .
what was your red room experience on hamilton island like ?

no she let the people of maine down by voting against obamacare repeal .
her vote in favor of tax reform is her way of trying to redeem herself .
needless to say it does n't make sense that she is letting people down by letting them take more of their income home .
the only people who would complain against tax cuts are the unproductive people who do n't pay taxes .
if they had more skin in the game then their opinion would be different .
loved the campaign and how it tied into the current canon .

to be fair i was confused about this for quite a while .
i am by no means a heavily religious person but i can tell you a plausible explanation .

when wolfenstein rebooted the first time in the early 90s it came out of the same mold as doom
who do you try to impress with you poorly researched facts ?
wolfenstein 3d was n't a reboot '' of castle wolfenstein because id did n't own the franchise and when wolfenstein 3d was released it did n't came out of the same mold as doom '' simply because it predated doom .

i can understand what you 're saying but you have to understand that to some adopted children the obstacle is n't what if my bio parents do n't want to see me ? ''
the obstacle is why would i want to see them . ''
i do n't mean that in a harsh way i have nothing against my bio parents and hope that whenever they are they 're healthy and living good lives but i hope that just about as much as i do for random strangers on the street .
i do n't think it 's fair to say that everyone always should try '' because for me it would be the equivalent of trying to start a deep emotional connection with the random middle-aged woman in front of me in line at the grocery store .
and even if i did feel obligated to try to seek them out surely that would come off as hurtful what am i supposed to say i sought you out in case you need help healing any emotional wounds but personally i do n't really care about you more than random people i pass in traffic ? ''
it 's not fair to put that pressure on any adopted person .
obviously some people do want to seek out their bio parents and best of luck to those who do ! but for those of us who do n't there 's no reason we should try just in case . ''

the a10 super gun was neither designed for or good at air to air .
that original vision has shifted to cas protecting friendlies pinned down on the ground by insurgents .
not a job you can do with an f35 or missiles .
if we want to replace the a10 for cas we need a cas drone .
low risk low speed low survival for attacking ground forces .
but instead of missiles they have miniature versions of the a10 gun .
smaller and slower they stay in closer and can coordinate to concentrate fire .
and such a platform could do more than just cas ...
calibrate the rounds and aiming systems to take out engine blocks and you could make an entire region into a no-drive zone .

funny thing got a degree in economics in one of the top ranked schools in the us then a master in econ policy in one of the top ranked schools in europe but hey youre probably right cuz i dont type gurd on the internets im probably not as smart as you since obviously you meticulously take the time to really comb over your comments
but lets get back to the point and see if you can stay on track the original comment you replied to was saying that he wanted americans to broaden their horizons reasonable enough in my opinion we 're quite woefully narrow minded and willfully ignorant .
your reply was just comparing us to ... . isolated peoples .
the average china man i think we can agree your average joe china man is not well connected to the outside world serbians who are pretty old school nationalistic and self isolated and not really ones to pay attention to world affairs georgians the same deal and i gave you spaniards as their on par with us as far as many worldly measures .
so once again my point americans by comparison to those you mentioned are lacking excuses for being so parochial '' we have internet and know how/use it we are better off economically than the vast majority of the world and transportation is absolutely not a problem .
so once again i ask you whats the us 's excuse for being this way as nothing you said is a valid reason or excuse
i had no point to make was just questioning yours you clearly cant follow a line of reasoning or debate

with the new operators coming out in 2 days and in 3 months the meta will change .
best advice learn both and choose based on your team mates picks for operators .
rook for roaming team mates and doc for your less roaming mates .
i have combination skin thats greatly exacerbated by my working conditions fast food so lots of oil from external factors not enough chances to drink water during the work day leading to dehydration shaving every day so my jaw is constantly getting ingrowns/acne from irritated follicles .
i want to start using a bb cream instead of my foundation which is great no issue there for additional moisturization in the winter hello awful awful forced air heating but most of them are caked with spf .
while i would love to use spf both chemical and physical like titanium dioxide make me break out something awful .
chemical sunscreens because chemicals and physical because they do n't let my skin breathe .
does anyone have recommendations for a light-medium to medium coverage bb/cc/tinted moisturizer with little to no spf ?
i would prefer liquid or cream because powders tend to dry me out .
i saw 2 wands 1 codex and i got reeves that day .
it literally gives you the example of blackmail and humiliation ?
for example the intimidation may be letting them know you could use something to harm their career .
now if it 's obvious like you 're a sexual deviant '' there 's not much intelligence involved but if it 's something like if you do n't help us we will need to go to your rival who will undoubtedly receive the favour of the local nobility .
oh my you do n't think this could harm your chances of becoming governor do you ? ''
basically anything that is n't just we will send everyone the tape '' or whatever could arguably be intelligence .
it 's obviously a lottery he did n't just figure that out after blowing 3k fuse and not getting anything .
it was always a safer option to just buy a 6 link .
even if you get lucky the profit would n't be that big .
there 's not a big reason to try 6 linking stuff yourself other than gambling .
i had some head trauma in the past that left me with very poor memory .
denmark are a very good team and peru are certainly no slouches either .
so in hindsight constantly playing the woman card suddenly looks like bad strategy .
you got ta have some reason even if appealing to women voters for vote for me '' more than just i 'm a woman '' .
well that 's fine lilybelle so am i so what makes you worth my vote rather than that other candidate ?
thanks but will the vanilla server be on the tbc prepatch ?
and we 're playing fairly casual for now so we might be 60 but i doubt we 'll be at the end game content just yet which we do wan na do but with the lvl 60 talent trees .
in the indian culture there are rules about who gets to wear the headdress .
thus if you see someone wearing a headdress he must be an important man .
as soon as other people start wearing the headdress this no longer holds .
the regard for an indian leader is reduced since it now becomes pretty normal to wear a headdress .
when everyone has it it is n't as special anymore .
i did n't mean hipsters are deplorable people and now the headdress is tainted by scumbag wearers .
i just took hipsters as an early adopter of this new headwear in this example .
1 control magic no doubt about it won me so many games so that i can say the best creatures in my deck are my opponent 's creatures .
2 animate dead we do n't usually think of it as an enchantment but it is one and the best reanimation spell in this format and many other formats .
3 spirit link so versatile you just have to love it no wonder they had to introduce lifelink effects later on because this one is too good at 1 mana .
4 unstable mutation blue does n't get many buffs but this one is really good
5 immolation 2 to power or 2 to toughness where relevant is a really good tool .
oubliette is really nice but it 's a global enchantment so i did n't include it .
i can print things in 3d for much cheaper and it is only a bit louder .
the downside being it takes 12 hours of printing .
those forearms are the only thing i can focus on every time i see this .
hey man without a replay to go on here 's a comment i posted recently to another post .
macro and mechanics are the key words you 'll want to be looking into online .
i started playing 12 months ago and have been climbing the ladder consistantly since the start despite playing no more than 2-3 ladder games per week .
mechanics research the different hotkey layouts experiment with them change them customise them to your own preferences .
i 'm just now starting to try to angle myself into macro-cycles .
macro grind the first 6 mins or so of your game esp get the 19 nexus bit up until your second pylon just before the deviation based on tech choice etc .
i 've only recently started looking into builds and not even to use against players just as macro guides and exposisions of co-ordination of build order for practice .
i do n't want to gimp my development with the crutch of build orders .
activating the essential abilities guardian etc.. pulling back blinking away injured shields and target fire specialised units imm collo etc.. uses all my apm easy .
instead i 've focussed on the things i do just outside of battle .
positioning presplit units pig has good video on this .
multi prong into their mineral lines with dts just before engaging their front .
this is the stuff you need to already be doing before your micro really becomes the limmiting factor .
the importance of things to tackle for growth at a given stage of the ladder scales with the level of zoom '' you are at when looking at those game aspects .
this holds for at least the first maybe 60-70 of the skill progression i think.. maybe even all the way to the top but i would n't stand next to that .
to under stand the zoom '' thing i am talking about here 's an example .
from the level of scale of an engagement the game-aspect of expansion-timings is almost completely incomprehensible .
the things which matter on this scale are the mirco-positions and states of the units in combat .
right so the order as i see it at least follows something like this..
i put decisionmaking in the order but really it ocurrs on a sepparate meta-layer allongside all the other levels of resolution including mechanics but here it happens in the process of building your muscle memory so it 's very meta relative to game-state and so i kind of sepparated the two types '' with its position in the above
another way of thinking about this model is the idea of containers '' .
micro ocurrs within the container '' of positioning which ocurrs in the container '' of macro which ocurrs within the container '' of mechanics .
create the container of your mechanics then inside that construct your macro and within the structure of your macro install your positioning and as a minigame playing inside your positional plays hone your micro .
this is your ability to maintain the quality of each of these levels of resolution and to hold the game-state '' in your mind as a unified simultanious whole .
your skill level at the game '' is the aggregate level of execution of all of the above in a given game .
at each of these zooms '' there is a cascade of levels for complexity difficulty and importance .
and thus multitasking is the maintenance of these levels at a sufficiently complex and effective values .
the longer a given level of resolution is left unchecked the greater it 's deviation from ideal will become .
learning from watching your replays essentially consists of you comparing your performance from first person perspective to this model of nested cascades .
when i did this i was doing something useful but not nearly as necessary as that '' as determined by your understanding of what you ought to be doing '' gleaned from massive research online articles posts streams youtube tournament play build orders etc..
any questions disagreements requests for more detail or example etc.. feel free
while i 'm in a slump i just keep trying to start a script and work on other peoples projects meanwhile .
have n't written a full script in months now but i 've finally gotten an idea that really sticks after numerous tries .
right and remember it 's only a hardship for one of the criminals .
the other criminal is engaging in his chosen profession .
oh my lord i got into that game for free and upgraded to level 1 but it was so depressing .
i remember it as a nm home game and boomer did his lap of honour to what felt like an empty stadium .
also the game itself was probably one of the worst games i watched the whole year .
i 'd prefer not to say i have a good graduate level job that i 'm very happy with .
if you can manage all these accounts and not die from stress start your own company and do it yourself .
you 're a highly skilled marketer and you need to know your worth .
starting a rook is stupid if he does not deserve it

it does n't matter if that measure means there will always be some people in poverty as the headline is n't about x people in poverty '' it 's saying x more people in poverty since last time ''
the existence of some people in relative poverty is necessary by the measure the rapid increase of people in relative poverty is not .

do you actually think people think it 's okay to kill babies ?
i do n't see i difference between a baby that is about to be born and a baby that is born .
there is however a difference between an undeveloped fetus still within the abortion range inactive brain therefore not conscious evidence show it is around 6 month into pregnancy that the brain becomes active which is further backed by that being the most premature a baby can be born and still survive and a newborn baby .
i think abortion after six months should only be performed in medically necessary situations where the life of the woman is in danger .
that baby mentioned in this scenario could possibly be put up for adoption .
you might say then that the adoption option is the viable option in any situation .
however pregnancy is n't something that anyone should be forced to go through with .
it 's not like you just pop a baby out and everything goes back to normal .
pregnancy and childbirth permanently alter and in most cases damage a woman 's body in one way or other .
would you like me to list the literally horrifying things that are involved in pregnancy and childbirth .
because you are probably very unaware of most of them .
not to mention the psychological effects of being forced to go through with something such as that .
a woman and anyone for that matter has the right to choose what happens to and what grows inside their own body .
an undeveloped and unconscious fetus does not have more rights than the body it is feeding of off for survival .
i got lost in the details after a while it 's been so long since i played it but i think i get what happened seems like a legit glitch .
the part that most confused me was having a party level 99 at the start
are you autologging in as the old bug is back for me .
but does get censer bearers doomwheels and warp lightning cannons ...
that he basically let spurs away with 3 red cards during the battle of the bridge '' because he did n't want them to blame him .
there 's a few threads on it here and at r/chelseafc
in fact they were the ones that told me they were carrying it and they ordered it for me .
i told my eye doctor and she had no problems writing the script for the generic .
it does take a couple of days to get because they have to order it .

so my locals are pretty competitive with many of them playing spyrals and the like .
my hopes for this deck is to remain somewhat competitive despite using a non-meta deck .
i think i have managed to make the most consistent version that i can possibly build at the moment but feedback on card ratios is always welcome .
even with the addition of dark magician the dragon knight the deck still suffers from back-row destruction in the early game so any feedback or ideas on protecting it is greatly appreciated and as with other decks spicy techs are also welcome .
i 'm going to be explaining my choices so please bear with me .
but seriously you want him in your hand so i run 3 .
searches dark magician can be special summoned by discarding one card and is an honest for dark spellcasters .
searches dark magician spells and traps and can be used for knowledge if needed .
i like him but kind of clogs up hands .
banish opponent 's stuff on dark magician summon which is nice .
i run 3 as this is the main part of the deck in my opinion .
it feels like 3 copies clogs up the deck and 1 copy seems to little .
also helps when you have all the pieces in your hand except dark magician .
i run 1 since apprentice illusion magician is a thing .
run 1 since it can get cloggy with more .
since most of the special summoning is done during your opponent 's turn it does n't seem like this is such a bad option at 1 .
i run 3 as this is another key component .
special summons dark magician and either apprentice illusion magician or magician of dark illusion and can be used to negate spells and traps the turn after activation .
battle traps help and can clog your opponent 's field .
i make this when that card on top of my opponent 's deck looks like a twin twister .
special summons dark magicians from hand or deck and banishes stuff when dark magician declares an attack .
can also be summoned by stacking on a rank 6 xyz looking at you norito .
token generator and can destroy stuff your opponent controls which is nice .
specials a dark spellcaster from your deck and non-targeting destruction seems ni ... oh .
protected by eternal soul can be special summoned from grave by eternal soul .
oh and protects back row which is really nice .
good against pendulum magicians since it can negate spell cards .
more negates and lets you special 2 extra deck monsters which is cool .
helps when facing dinos lightsworn and any other decks that banish stuff .
that 's a nice boss monster you got there .
that 's a nice boss monster you got there .
that 's a nice boss monster you got there .
i do n't main this out of fear of top-decking it .
as the main monster in your deck is a normal monster it does n't really hurt the deck 's ability to win .
thanks for putting up with it and i look forward to your comments !
last evening my 1 year 2 months old phone got stuck on the google logo and kept restarting .
looked up and found out that bootloop is apparently a common issue .
throughout the next day i kept turning it off waiting then turning it on with no luck .
sometimes it would boot up for a few seconds .
after more than 24 hours it finally turned on and i was able to download back all of my apps .
it 's been on for about an hour now typing this on my phone right now ... anyone else 's phone fix itself ?
update phone bootlooped again and could n't turn it back on for 5-6 hours until just now ... rip nexus 5x you were a good friend
i have been doing quite a lot of come over and let 's play vr ! ''
sessions with my friends and of course they are all introduced to most of the go-to titles when trying to sell '' vr first contact the lab robo recall lone echo etc .
..but at repeat visits what we usually gravitate towards are the async coop games especially keep talking and nobody explodes which really gets people excited sitting with the printed copy of the bomb manual time ticking and everything .
also i expect you to die '' was a hit with 2 people following on the display mirror on big tv while 3rd is in hmd and gets suggestions from the guys outside .
now i am interested in knowing if there are other similar games especially true async coop games like ktane where guys outside have actual tasks as well as hmd wearer .
i have leaned a little towards escape room games and they seem interesting but we have n't really tried them yet and some of them seem a little rough on the edges .
welcome to evolve your game family eygf https cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295465156350181377/387527839055872010/eyg.png we heard you have been looking for an awesome clan or even a family of clans !
well you sound like a perfect fit to join our family of 15 clans !
we 've setup eyg family discord server for clash of clans .
once joined ask for ticticboom oliver queen or any recruiter
put from reddit '' or ticticboom sent me '' in request so i do n't have to ask you the standard questions and i know you read this thread .
the evolve your game family of clans is looking for a few good men and women to join our family !
we currently have 15 total clans in the family .
the war clans are constantly warring and participating in monthly events and leagues .
we have 2 that are fwa clan to help develop your account without worrying about war .
we have 1 for farming and 1 events clan .
we want to extend our arms to players that are looking to be a part of a team and grow as a clash of clans player .
we participate in fwa fwl lwcw ewl ndl monthly clan events and we are aspiring to be a part of the cwl !
we are looking for people that play every day .
this clan will also work for people with mini/multiple accounts that ca n't war in their main clans .
no drama no kids and the clan is ego free .
any problems you had in your last clan ... . we do n't have it !
we are a no non-sense family of clans without drama where you can largely do what you want .
i 'm not just saying that to recruit you like other clans do we actually never have drama .
let me introduce you to evolve your game family '' eygf we are a mixed th8-11 level laid back but serious base maxing and war clan family .
if you do n't like collecting lots of war win bonuses and high level walls this is probably not the right place for you .
some clans are farm war clans some have war alliances and some think they are above and better than everyone else .
we are none of these we are a family that simply remains competitive while having a good time in the process with minimal issues .
the thing that i 'd say is our best feature as a family is that after your first two wars with us you are free to largely make your own team based decisions in war there is no dictatorship no clash caller or any of that rubbish .
you will have the independence to really play your part and have a say for the team which is extremely rare in this game .
it is very rare after your first two wars that a base will be assigned to you only in majorly tight situations .
we have training videos among other stuff which is recommended but not required .
we do big wars we do small wars we do lots of fun events that other clans do n't do and we have a pretty damn good record at big wars .
we have war league opportunities which are entirely optional .
we believe in providing our players with all types of different options to play with .
as long as you have a good attitude with a willingness to improve your base as well as your war attacks you are welcome to join any of our clans depending on your base development levels .
we will show you the ways to smash bases at all town hall levels if you 're learning .
we are currently accepting applications from town hall 9 onwards and th6 onwards for weak slothz2 and whiskey taco
we are currently holding a few level 10 clans which we are planning to build up in time from clans that merged into us .
we turned failing clan 's goblin fury and frost light around in a month a piece could your clan be next ? .
alternatively if your clan would like a merge please contact any co-leader on here so we can see if we are a fit .
anyone who wants to speak with the leaders of clans who successfully merged into us in the past is welcome to do so .
movement is highly encouraged between not only our own 15 clans but you 're also encouraged to visit friends visit clans we 've faced in wars for feedback and participate in reddit/forum events .
once again how many clans will allow you to do all is ?
to join either clan one thing we stress that is important and key to our success is you have to be a team player and make your own goo team based decision .
in war everything is about the team and you will find yourselves in different situations where you will be able to raid up or do what you like when the war allows it however in close wars if its required to hit down for the team we expect you to help out offer a scout ect this is the same for all members from leader to member quite often a leader will step aside and let a member take a tough base hitting down if it suits the team there are no egos involved .
no specific set of clan rules mainly just do n't be a ♥♥♥♥ .
the no heroes no war in eygf is not enforced but as long as you 're doing your bit for the team the best way you can you wo n't be hounded for one bad attack instead we will help you improve .
not using war raids when opted in is the only other thing that will put your spot in the clan in jeopardy
apply in game or through our discord channel be sure to say you 're from the reddit and that you read post in eygf subreddit or by ticticboom in your request so we do n't have to ask the usual questions .
if not bookmark us and pay us a visit sometime or feel to join our public discord channel to see how we operate

i 'm trying to find a retailer to sell me some network equipment a nas among other thing for bch .
the thing is i live in the eu and if the items are shipped from outside of the eu there will be a hefty customs fee to pay .

buying an amazon gift card could also be a solution but gyft does n't seem to accept bch .

hi i 'm looking for suggestions on jazz instrumental albums to check out !
i 'm not too in the know as far as jazz musicians go but i 'm hoping to find some new favorite artists from this here post .
i must emphasize i am looking for mainly instrumental/vocal less albums if possible .
i was channel surfing and landed on the cw 50 .
i 'm getting a error 70 that the program is blacked out in my area .
i thought i was supposed to be able to watch all cw tv shows .
it 's the first time i 've watched the cw 50 live .
i use the app for any shows but have to deal with a 24 wait .
this time you 're playing for an actual prize .
every question you ask contributes exactly .01 to its progression .
when it does someone will win a 50 gift card .
consider this my potential christmas gift to one of you .
the winner will be determined by random from the pool of people who contribute .
if this ama finishes before i have the funds available i can only ask that the winner be patient until i do have them .
i havent seen a player yet with a higher win rate on dire than on radiant .
there is almost always a big differnce of more than five percentage points .
of course the most obvious reason would be an unbalanced map but i wonder if this is the only reason ?
i asked about a dozen friends who play dota about their favorite faction without considering win rates .
the majority chose radiant because they prefer playing up '' on the map or they just like the more positive appearance .
a rotation of the map by 180 degrees without changing the good/bad themes and in a third version they also swap that .
with a sample size big enough this could tell us the impact of the map itself and if its unbalanced and also the psychological effect it has on players .
sadly this wont be a thing so its just a thought experiment but what do you think would happen ?
what side do you prefer and why without thinking about the win rates ?
i 'd understand if it helped make returns faster but it does n't .
as white noise comes very soon i see that most people are buying dokka and completely ignoring vigil and zofia .
go on any rainbow six yt channel and i almost guarantee that they will say dokka is great .
the season is tomorrow or today by the time you read this and a lot of people are going to buy dokka but you should pick wisely .
a lot of people are making this decision foolishly .
you should pick someone who actually fits your play style .
it 's better to be good with a bad operator than to be bad with a good operator .
tl dr buy someone who fits your play style not someone who everyone says is good .
there are but radical right wing americans are demonstrably way more dangerous .

be hollywood actress who quid-pro-quoed her way to roles and maybe even oscars by selling sexual favors to harvey weinstein or some other producer in full knowledge of what you were doing and what the trade entailed .
consented to it anyway because you wanted to get ahead .
feel sad and ashamed about it over the years .
you 're a slut with no redeeming qualities besides a previously tight cunt and you should be ashamed of yourself
decide to excise your shame for your grossly apparent character flaws by accusing the man of rape in full knowledge that you can use the otherwise healthy societal impulse towards gynocentrism to your advantage and cry sexism at any reasonable doubt
many innocent men have their lives and reputations ruined by a horde of quid-pro-quo prostitutes while regrettably those few cases of genuine victims coming forward in the ordeal are drowned out in the noise of your collective shrieking
completely diminish and cheapen the severity of sexual assault in the public consciousness in one part due to over exposure to plainly ridiculous hysteria and in one part due to though they dare not breath a word of it everyone knowing you 're a bunch of quid-pro-quo prostitutes who sold sexual favors to advance your career
corporations and men at large begin to adapt in this knowledge they dare not breath a word of .
decide they do n't want to be around quid-pro-quo sluts who 'll exploit otherwise healthy societal gynocentrim and muh listen and believe '' to get ahead in life by intentionally making false rape accusations
but ... das like ... unfair and sexist ? ''
new rule any woman who has made an accusation as part of the metoo saga who is unwilling to carry the matter to court should be immediately relieved of employment and marched naked through the streets to be shamed before the eyes of her countrymen .
want to use gynocentrism and exploit societies good will to get ahead in the world ?
consider your best vine-climbing strategy to be that pussy between your legs and the sympathy it earns you ?
show the whole fucking country that pussy you 're so proud of .
i do n't often dip into my full blown far right moral leanings i discuss the politik but rarely the morals on kotakuinaction but i will here due to how personally this hits me you 're a fucking subversive degenerate sandberg .
you knowingly exploit the societal values that were designed to cultivate a healthy and functional nation the impulse that leads husbands to protect wives fathers to protect daughters and brothers to protect sisters in a shallow cynical and self-interested propagation of your narrow caste interests .
no this is n't about women '' at all for you and we all see it ... it 's about protecting the right of upper class women to become really upper class women by destroying those around them in their reckless selfish ambition .
and when the world sees you for what you are ?
when society listens to its internal intuition and even dares to recognize that women are fully formed people capable of cunning and deception and indulges in gasp !
why you do what listen and believe '' has always been from the start you curl your hair into pigtails bat your eyelashes and say b-but daddy i 'm a good girl ...
you sandberg would be of the status of a delinquent child were you not so overtly malicious and calculating .
you 're the case for the victorian era writ ever so large .
this is my first post on this subreddit and reddit in general .
i was hoping i could get some insight from people who have went to graduate school for a msee .
i have graduated with my bachelors degree this past spring and currently employed .
however i feel like i really want to go back to school and get a masters degree at some point in the near future .
i am currently looking at different programs and wondering if anyone here has done an online program to get a msee or even meng ?
if so could you tell me about your experience ?
the reason i am asking is because i am considering working and going back to school simultaneously .
however there are n't really an schools close enough to make it work for my current job/situation .
there seems to be quite a bit of online msee programs from various colleges and universities .
i want to know how that would compare to on campus education .
from my undergrad experience it 's very beneficial to be hands on in the classroom and obviously that would be difficult with an online classroom .
so i 'm just trying to see what is the best option going forward .
also any helpful information about graduate school in general is welcome !

if you can keep your head when all about you
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting
and yet do n't look too good nor talk too wise
if you can bear to hear the truth you 've spoken
or watch the things you gave your life to broken
if you can make one heap of all your winnings
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
except the will which says to them ‘hold on ! '
if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
if all men count with you but none too much
yours is the earth and everything that 's in it

i 've been meaning to post for a long time on reddit but have never really justified the right time to do so i posted a picture of a tree in my front yard not too long ago but that does n't have much to do with what has been on my mind for a verrrrry long time .
i was struggling to decide on which sub reddit i should write this post but enfp makes the most sense to me because i 'm hoping that some of you guys and gals might be able to relate .
i am an enfp myself and this year has been a crazy internal rollercoaster of ups and downs .
i grew up in a conservative christian household and was led to believe that what we do in this life directly correlates to where we end up in the next reality .
but as i grew older i began to question everything .
i just so happened to be born into a household that follows the correct belief ?
there are so many other religions and ideologies they must all have some sort of credibility to them as well yeah ?
i must step outside of the life i have been given that 's what i thought .
i pursued every option there was and not just for religion but for cultural beliefs career paths and general ways of being .
meditation prayer zen living in the moment ... these were all things that stood out to me .
but do you want to know the one thing that stands out the most ?
the one thing that trumps all of the past present and future there could possibly be ?
that is the one thing that propels me forward .
i feel like amongst all the crazy politics cultures and conflicts of the world story is the one thing that brings us together as human beings .
and we can bring our individual stories together to form a collective narrative .
or at least something we can share with our partner best friend or workplace .
i 'm drunk and there will always be too many words too say in a single reddit post .
sometimes it all feels like too much ... i can see the entire universe past present and future in a tiny instant .
but then i zoom in and gain a sense of euphoria from knowing that there are a trillion stories to be told between a small group of people .
i just watched inception and i 'm convinced it 's the greatest movie of all time .

hi i hope this is ok to post here let me know if it is n't !
i 'm studying in hong kong right now i 'm british and i paid my accommodation up front for the full 10 months of my stay .
however due to a change of circumstances i wo n't be staying in hong kong after christmas leaving on the 22nd december .
this means that i would 've made use of 4 months of the 10 months of my lease .
i spoke to the accommodation owners and they said that they can not refund me the 6 months worth of rent that i wo n't make use of unless i can find someone to replace me which i ca n't because everyone i know in hong kong is also an exchange student who is leaving at christmas too .
i just wondered if i had any rights that allowed me to claim the money back that i did n't make use of or if i 'm just screwed basically ?
the accommodation is for students only however it is privately owned and run not affiliated with any universities or schools do n't know if that information helps but wanted to try and give as much info as possible !
thanks for you time and hopefully you may be able to help me !
i have ms and since i began being symptomatic i have gotten it 's not that bad and i have that too among other dismissive tendencies as well as calling me flat out lazy which imho kept me from being diagnosed for 10 years but now that i 'm older away from her and going through a seeeeeerious relapse i 'm not taking her shit anymore .
i was trying to explain to her a couple weeks ago how my adrenal gland is failing and she looked down her nose at me with that all too fucking familiar ‘i know better ' sneer on her face said i think you 're a little depressed too and i snapped ... kept it in because i love my brother and did n't want to make a scene but unloaded on her in text .
she had n't responded and it just so happened that when i finally grew strength to call her physical to talk emotionally i was still raging she was at a multiple sclerosis support group and shoved the phone in the face of some poor lady who got the rage i was preparing for nmom .
her unfortunate opening line was your mom tells me you need some support and i lost my shit on the poor lady blew her up and told the lady all her dirty laundry .
what came of that i have no clue but i owe that lady some flowers or something i have been diagnosed and a pretty severe case since ‘12 with an extensive network of health support groups not shitty mom support groups and i have never been secretive about my issues but due to advice from therapists and family i compartmentalized in order to have a relationship with her i 'd let her know what 's going on knowing she 'd bat me down and then go on with life like i had to .
i guess you could say that 's backfired now .
this will be quite literally the first time she has sought out information about my ms 1/4 illnesses i have she ca n't name the other 3 since i was diagnosed in ‘12 .
since the phone call she has told anyone who will listen how mean i 'm being and that she 's taking the high road by not responding and it 's making me angrier ...
i 'm at a loss and i honestly have veeeeeeery little support in this arena other than two people and i 've screamed their ear off a girl in my health support group suggested you all may be able to offer me some guidance while i 'm waiting to get into a therapy session ... thank you for reading my novel xx
was hoping for 10k before 2018 and look where we are .
unlike the other states of the u.s. maine has a long history of the freedom to roam https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_to_roam .
it usually means the right to trespass and use undeveloped land sometimes including harvesting for personal use .
according to the forest code article 13 citizens have the right to freely stay in the forest and collect wild fruits berries nuts mushrooms other food forest resources and medicinal plants to meet their own needs . ''
in maine we 've been privileged to use unmarked private land for hunting foraging fishing even in the case of logging lands for leasing to put cabins on .
logging companies especially taking up so much of the state have been particuliarly beneficial in maintaining the access to nature of the general public with their hands off land management .
but in the past few years this unwritten code up here has been increasingly threatened with the law preventing hunting access to unmarked land and the proposed law to prevent foraging on unmarked land https legislature.maine.gov/legis/bills/display_ps.asp ? ld=128 snum=128 the national monument logging companies rejecting renewing leases and in quite a few cases evicting the people who lived out there or buying up land from those few people who still lived on land they owned in the north maine woods .
how many places have been traditional fiddlehead harvesting grounds for hundreds of years where no one in town really knows who owns the land ?
i 'm proposing that we need some legal defense of this traditional right .
if someone wants to prevent people on their land they can always post it i 'm not suggesting this because it would make any change to the way we currently do things but because it would prevent infringement on this which is going to happen so long as it remains unwritten .
one drawback of cryosleep even if it becomes a reality is that we will be dirt poor and without credit in the future because of inflation .
that makes it undesirable compounded by the fact that all our loved ones are gone .
now with bitcoin the problem not only disappears but could leave us extremely wealthy in 100 years .
now where did i put that piece of paper ?
could you think of any reason that could justify to not set any spf record ?
i now have at least 128000000 experience points in the slayer skill .
i have been wondering when it is appropriate to say either of the above .
relatively new to torah and judaism and related topics .
i know roughly what the hebrew means so as not to simply parrot things i hear said on the internet .
also might add that im a noachide so i am also unsure if it is appropriate for me to say either of them at all .

i am a very experienced raider from back in vanila looking to get my fix again with project 60 and am currently leveling up a priest with plans to heal .

i also happen to stream and you can find my channel at http www.twitch.tv/breakycpk
just follow the link below and post your setups there .
edit 12/5 included 11 more respondents in the numbers .
a few weeks ago i asked you to post your crystal tower team setups in order to make a list of the most used ones .
from ace to zidane 62 respondents so far used a total of 130 different characters to conquer the crystal tower .
the top twenty one most used heroes of them all are
building four parties at once means that hastega sources are very valued moreso when they come with a stat boost for the whole party .
vessel of fate and shout are still pillars most players can and gladly will build their parties around no question .
same goes for tyro and his usb2 fantasy unbound which many people used for the same reason .
while some shun her bubbles ' side effect of slowing down the party 's collective sb gain y'shtola and her bsb asylum prove once again that she 's very very reliable in her job — keeping your guys alive .
even better for those who have chosen to dive her for that precious precious dualcast lm2 .
on the other side of team composition the winner of the dps race is unquestionably the dark horse of his realm cid raines storming in at third place purely by virtue of his ridiculously good bsb metamorphose and his ld .
a different picture comes up when we look at each battle separately though characters with synergy are bolded and in all caps
raines reigns supreme on this ladder because of course he does .
he occupies the 16-17th place on the global list with 22 hits and here we see that 21 out of those 22 are here against squall one keeper opted to use him against adel instead .
one of the squishiest characters in the game is number 4 against a boss that will kill her with one hit .
lastly i 'll mention kuja who did n't even make the top20 in the global list but here he came out just above cloud .
if anyone has been surprised to see luneth and refia in the top20 this is why .
scylla is generally viewed as one of the easier bosses and ff iii relics as good but not stellar .
the result is a bunch of characters with synergy people did n't use in the harder battles but still perfectly able to kick ass together .
that 's my theory at least next let us hunt ourselves a tortoise
ff xv is still a very new realm so players do n't have many good relics from it .
instead we have the thunder triad of ffrk ashe lightning and shantotto .
everyone just wants to shout at this lady to let poor rinoa go it seems .
this battle is also where most people sent their clouds and squalls .
keepers were also pulling all the stops with mag breaking as evidenced by vaan 's and fujin 's high placements .
if squall was n't immune to breaks vaan would very probably be near the global top .
y'shtola and larsa have the battles neatly divided between them .
going by their usage in the order of flights catgirl 's score is 18/1/4/16 and larsa 's is 2/13/11/3 .
astra for the two bosses that use statuses bubble for the two harder oned .

i love farming and i 'm in the mood to read another novel within these boundaries .
i ca n't think of the titles of the past one or two i 've read .
but think of the secret wisdom of the earth type of book .
long story short i did an ma in cog science a very long time ago .
i flaked at the end under pressure and did n't hand in my thesis or complete the module in connectionism .
the college have now been kind enough to let me hand in an assignment for the incomplete connectionism module in order to receive a grad dip .
i have the rethinking innateness book and am getting to grips with it .
the advisor wants me to pick a topic that interests me but i 'm somewhat overwhelmed .
i was thinking it might work out since it has an adjustable flow .
the aqueon my tank came with is for sure too much movement at 100gph .
just trying to get opinions and experience be for buying a whole new filter .
hi my hand got overstretched with the full weight of my sparring partner doing bjj while it was in palmar flexion my wrist hurts a lot and it popped its not that swollen you have any idea if it could be bad ?
so i left work early yesterday to get some time to enjoy the 65 degree weather and abundant sunshine and came in this morning to a package on my desk .
once i open it up to see whats inside i quickly realized that i now have aids and its going to be hard to explain to the wife .
thanks u/fish_and_whistle for the newly acquired monkey disease and for the cigats too .
ridentlor checking in for here for a quick and semi-elaborate guide for you as an outlander !
the reason i 'm making this guide is because let 's face it .
90 of the community hates seeing an outlander in-game they have barely any awesome perks for damage output and most of the time they just run around like a useless bot farming the entire game .
and i for one wants this to come to an end as soon as possible !
i started off my fortnite days playing as a constructor i love building and that 's pretty much what got me hooked on fortnite in the first place .
reality hits you it will hit you harder than when your legendary hero transform schematic bugs out and gives you a rare defender instead .
yes this is an actual problem in game right now .
you will have to endure seeing that slow wobbling bum running from stone to stone car to car slowly tearing things down in hope that someone will actually answer your plead of getting any help with supplying mats to the base .
with a quiet chat you start wobbling back to look for the objective that is yet to be found by the three outlanders running around smacking up everything with their bags full of goodness they are leaving a diarrhea trail of metal nabs mechanical parts and sadness .
as a constructor you must stay independent and strong find the base yourself and hope to epic games tm '' that they at least will be there when the mission starts .
cause if you fail you 're the one ending up on the bad side of the spectrum every single time .
i have my fair share of hours set on constructors and i was on the brink of stop playing this god forsaken game and just moving on .
but then it hit me i 'll just try maining an outlander for a while just to switch things up a bit .
i just reached twine now and i 've been playing outlander since the start of plankerton .
barely recieved any hate ever and people usually appriciate having me with them made loads of friends along the way .
now this is something that all players should be doing always .
if everyone communicated in this game oh my.. we would all be blessed now wouldnt we ?
start every game by introducing yourself and let your team know that .
if they need anything from you you will be there and help them out with it .
you are one of the most mobile classes in the game and there is no reason ever for a constructor to run help out with a empowered husk encampment when they are busy doing their thing .
i main outlander i will be your personal lady dog for today i will be dropping all my stone and metal on the objective as soon as i find it !
yes this is also your job but it 's great if everyone helps out
by doing this you will have let your team know what you are up to and that you 're not smacking off to chests and all the pretty loot scattered around the map .
do n't worry i will come back to this part later
your team now understands that they have an outlander who is willing to commit to teamwork to achieve that sweet victory your team and you have gathered up the required materials to build that awesome base !
well tough luck do never and i mean never go into a fortnite mission and expect people to cooperate with you doing that will leave you sad and broken .
you need to stay strong and independent as a fortnite player only the strongest will survive until twine peaks .
build the base yourself and do it freakin good no sloppy ass job with a wooden pyramid set traps and do your thing..
when that 's all done inform your team that you have buildt the base traps are set and you are ready to go whenever !
also let your team know that you will be resourcing now and they are allowed to start and defend the objective without you but make sure to let them know that if they need your hard working outlander ass they will have to tell you .
and if they do you turn 180 degrees and go straight back to base cause you sure as hell didnt do all this for nothing .
by now your team should love you if they do n't then you are sure as hell going to convince yourself that you would have loved you if you played with you !
now some pointers that will make you one of the best outlanders in the world !
llama fragments smack em up and take the mats for yourself unless you 're full bring back to base if you have a constructor on the team always bring that llama straight back to the constructor and let them have the copper/silver/mala/shards/sun .
cause they do not have the luxury of running around the map gathering all kinds of resources playing constructor should pay off in some way .
weapons outlanders do n't have that awesome damage output like ninjas and soldiers make sure that you get yourself an awesome sniper/rocket launcher and a good melee weapon to help out with flingers under defence and good sidearm with that and you are good to go !
bags never fucking ever run around with a full bag .
make use of your materials in any way possible so you can keep farming trust me that you do not need 2500 rough ore and 3000 planks in your arsenal ask someone to make some traps for you with your mats..
ask someone in game if they would like to trade something all items are always needed in this game item value is relevant to each and every individual .
making room if you are going to defend a point you as an outlander can be freaking awesome tear down every single house or tree or anything blocking your teams vision around the base this will make all defences so much easier by all means .
defence if you 're gon na defend as outlander your prio targets will be the following order
lobbers siege purple stay high ground and snipe those screaming lady dogs with the awesome field of view that you just made for you and your team !
beehives now these nasty lady dogs can really screw things up for your team if you see more than one coming for your team you might even want to put your focus off the siege lobbers !
petrol husks now this is a sensetive husk with an explosive personality that you will have to play around are they a good distance away from your base/team ?
snipe that tank that they are holding and boom you might just have saved the day !
if they are not just do n't bother shooting them at all unless you got nothing better to shoot at .
well good thing you know the secret arts of slice and dice !
get down from high ground and slap those grunting sticklegs silly !
normal husks they are slow and easy to shoot !
your fragment skills like the llama teddy and shock tower have a hit box .
this means that you can block funnels and objectives with them .
done right you can block a charging smasher blaster lazers and flailing takers to better help your team !
now i do n't have to go on forever with this and the rest you need to know i think should come with common sense .
playing an outlander to their full potential is the roughest but most rewarding path there is .
thank you for reading and now go my new born outlander go and show the world that we can be as awesome as the rest !
i 'm starting to work on some of mine .
i currently live a really sloppy unstructured life but i graduate in a few weeks from undergrad and i 'm taking some time to work before law school so i 'm hoping this is my chance to build good habits .

back of postcard says this is my first school but not my last '' .
this card was paired with another postcard of a school in berlin new york that had identification on it unlike this one .
but first here 's what i 'm working with .
when i brought them inside the peppers on plants ripened and some flowers popped .
they were not in the tent yet had n't made it yet and were living in a window with about 7-8 hrs of light .
after 3-4 weeks they were not looking happy so i got them a real home .
once i got the light and timer i read the web a bit and figured it try 14on 10off light cycle to start .
the tallest plant is about 14 '' from the light an smallest 32 '' .
i 've recently noticed two of the plants have a few aphids .
i 'm casually managing it not terribly bothering me at the moment .
any tips outside of my questions are appreciated as well .
is there a minimum amount of light required for the plant to flower/fruit ?
why are some of the blossom buds that are forming on the aphid plants ?
could it also just be them potentially getting burned ?
should i harvest the remaining fruit and prune them ?
is it beneficial to give them a true dormant period or can i really keep them going 365 ?
thanks in advance if you read to the bottom and also if you choose to help me .
it 's almost another tuesday which means it 's time for another off-topic robots !
i joined reddit tonight just for you and after scrolling for the past hour your comments have already given me much joy so for that alone i thank you .

tonight i decided i will cut the cord for the usual reason .
we have hulu/netflix/prime and sling hindi megapack husband 's from india so he watches all the indian channels .
aside we do n't have plain sling just this indian channel one .
i highly recommend if you have a homesick indian person in your household .
i greatly dislike giving them 140/mo for the triple play .
it was like 80 when i signed up with time warner .
they got bought around the time our contract expired so the price went up .
i discovered downgrading '' to internet-only with them would cost roughly 70/mo plus tax for 100mbps .
nevermind that they advertise internet-only service on their website for like 49/mo plus tax .
i 've called i 've chatted i 've checked their website/my account .
naturally i 'm mad as hell and i 'm not gon na take it anymore .
verizon rcn or satellite pick your flavor actually there 's only one now right ?
so the way i see it my two options are spectrum 's crap deal or buying a hotspot device and service from at t tmo or verizon .
for the hotspot option i am not under the impression it 'd save us a ton .
still i 'd love to stick it to spectrum i 'm nothing if not principled if i thought the service was reliable and we would n't burn through it in like a week .
it 's just me and my husband in our little household and we occasionally watch something different at the same time .
we do n't game or anything just stream tv shows from above services .
i 'm particularly curious about tmo since we have our mobile service with them plus their binge-on data plan is a nice perk .
i listen to my music at gym/on walks/etc without using up all our data .
i think reddit and i are gon na be great together .
thanks for reading and any advice you may have .
system of equation solvers and quadratic equation solvers can be helpful .

the world stands at a precipice with nationstates around the globe rising out from obscurity to stake their claim to the lands around them .
no doubt this will create hostilities in due time as nations seek to reclaim old glories in the name of new ambitions .
with this being the case prendota kniaziewicz człowiektronu of sóltron has invited numerous heads of state from the local regional powers to combat a number of issues
the rising food shortage of multiple nations in the region
various issues of national sovereignty and claims to land ownership overlapping
prendota with an eye for the furtherance of humanity and the reclamation of society as a whole rather than anything else looks to resolve these conflicts peacefully before a powder keg begins to form in central europe .
to this end he announces his aim of forming the intermarium a joint alliance and perhaps joint government if the constituent members wish it with the intent of maintaining peace in the region .
the following are hereby invited to wieliczka https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wieliczka to debate on the establishment of such an organization and to establish the founding document and bylaws that may in due time secure the future of central and eastern europe

those that attend are asked to maintain a respectful demeanor of all attendees and to make an opening statement regarding the intended sovereign borders of their nation so that we may resolve conflicts of national sovereignty quickly and peacefully to prevent bloodshed .
after these things are done then we may safely allocate what food is available to alleviate the issues of starvation within the region and finally begin reclaiming society .
prendota states firstly of uniting poland under the banner of soltron and should the peoples be willing reclaiming lwów and cieszyn perhaps even uniting czechoslovakia and expanding eastward to the dmowski line .
beyond this he holds no claims and promises in these endeavors not to breach the national sovereignty of those attendees who may hold claim to these regions as well .

relationships do n't work with these kinds of shackles balls and chains ... . unless you 're into that kind of thing .
are you able to do what you want in this relationship and ok with what your partner wants to do in this relationship ?
is your partner able to do what he wants in this relationship and are you ok with what he does in this relationship ?
is no one getting hurt because of the things you are doing in your relationship ?
if you ca n't answer yes to all three of these questions honestly there is a problem in your relationship you need to work out .
if you or your partner can not find a reasonable compromise then you two need to break up .
this situation you have would not be ok for a majority of people and i 'm not sure why you 're ok being told what you can and ca n't do but having no say in his behavior .

marie-josee ta lou is 5 ' 2.5 '' https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie-jos c3 a9e_ta_lou
this ruling is entirely based upon the us constitution .
article 2 of the us constitution outlines executive powers and the president 's right to restrict immigration to certain people or groups of people are well within the president 's enumerated powers granted by article 2 of the constitution .
judges from lower courts have no authority to issue injunctions precluding the president 's lawful orders so the injunction was stayed .
a separate constitutional argument is a claim that this bill which is facially neutral could be a violation of 1st amendment protections as-applied to a particular set of facts .
that claim will certainly fail based on long-standing precedent that has been reaffirmed multiple times .

a computer is a fundamental type of machine that has nothing to do with how you use it .
computing '' is not a type of work you do with a machine it is what the machine does to give you an output to work at all .
originally they were for solving complex math problems and they still are it 's just now those computations produce all of the output you receive from your device .

now is he russel wilson who is rarely thinking about crossing the line of scrimmage but still running/moving because he has 100 percent confidence in his arm ?
it 'll be his first week back so he 'll probably be a bit rough around the edges .

i personally enjoy solo motorcycle trips taking dogs for a walk and photography .
let 's explore both options and give equal time to every position our there .
chances are you are projecting unresolved emotions based on past experiences .
if you 've cheated in a past relationship then it is possible that your subconscious assumes that other people are just like you and are also capable of cheating like you have .
i would probably see if you can work on introspection and look up therapy methods like cbt .
if your partner has given you no reason to distrust him ei he 's always honest open and willing to communicate with you about any concerns or worries you may have then this whole situation could truly be just unresolved anxiety and projecting .
in addition if this is something you have n't brought up to your partner before i 'd recommend genuinely having an open conversation about these anxious thoughts .
you can even preface the conversation by telling him that you know that they are n't rational thoughts .
anxiety does that it 's a fight/flight response that does n't necessarily have an off '' button .
but discussing techniques and coping methods that you might both know that could help you overcome this irrational fear and learn to trust and accept his love as a constant might be more helpful .
if you think a conversation with your partner about this might be too encroaching or invasive if you 're in school i 'm sure they offer counseling or resources that can help you .
i have n't seen you in a long time .
the different settings and abilities barely make a difference .
the only thing i care about is having a big population so i can continue playing halo .
i think a classic halo with no sprint and no abilities will completely fail in sales and will have a non existent competitive scene .
the competitive players will find other things to trash like bad kill times bad shield bad maps but i will still be playing as long as it has the following things .
i 'm much better at expressing myself in writing .
especially if i 'm talking to someone new or if it 's unexpected like a city worker showing up at my door needing to discuss something i 'll have a lot of trouble expressing what i want to say .

in his mind coming to your door to give you a letter is not creepy and does n't think this is a matter that the cops could be called for or anything like that .
giving you a letter is really not that bad.. he is stupid though you should text him saying you do n't want anything with him and that he 's making you feel very uncomfortable and that he needs to stop .

if they decide you 're not insured then you 're liable for all the other costs and their claims as you were at fault the front car will claim from the car behind the car behind will claim from you you will have to claim from yourself .
depending on the damage that could be between hundreds and thousands of pounds .
if any car is written off or there 's any whiplash claims that could be a lot of money .
you were technically driving without insurance as you say yourself you 're only insured to drive for personal use not commuting or business .
that could mean you 've broken the law by driving uninsured .

majority seem to be going for richarlison or both here i think i will go for the latter too .
is it worth considering burnley 's style of play against richarlison 's ?
i believe it 's been discussed in the past that richarlison has been somewhat wasteful with his attempts lots of misses losing the ball trying to take on defenders etc .
his conversion rate is lower but he has a chance so often that he still gets points but hardly ever gets bonus points .
with that in mind it has also been posted on this sub a video on burnley 's style of play '' .
they give space further from goal and the cbs block off the shots that will go towards the wide areas of the goal forcing the shot to either be blocked or go down the middle for the gk .
will this encourage more of richarlison 's wasteful shots ?
and push up bps for mee tarkowski and pope ?
burnley encourage weaker attempts on goal and block them .
what tier of global critical strike multiplier is that tried to make that amulet in pob but ca n't get it over 38
i was n't climbing into rear seats back then ! ! !
did the whole climb into the back seat '' thing .
it was so tiny i decided to film all the back seat quirks while i was back there since i did n't want to climb in back a second time in order to do them again .
got it all done about 9 minutes total between climbing in back saying everything and all my line screw-ups and re-starts .
came out to check the sound i had forgotten to press record on the camera .
that happens sometimes but on the back seat segment ? ! ? ! ? ? !
this works but it reverts back to default after changing loadouts or exiting the backpack .
is there a way to save this setting sort name ?
i have 1 watercooled and flashed vega 64 watercooled bios onto it .
it 's so easy and standard to the point that buying the vega 64 is n't worth it .
not to mention i can get more out of it if i actually played with the settings .
now pricing is another thing i got mine at 399 no tax a few weeks back .
there 's no way anyone can say juju laying out burfict a guy who has a terrible reputation especially concerning the steelers and doing some mma taunting was some coincidence .
juju clearly wanted to put some extra mustard on the dude who has been laying dirty hits and trashing his teammates .
sigh as a neutral viewer the guy was clearly using excessive force to try and send a message .
based off of some of the comments last week i 've been giving assassin 's creed origins a go and really enjoying the combat .
i 'm not very far into the game because i 've been seeing how nearly every game in my steam library looks after i built this pc last week .
i 'm also really enjoying the session demo from their kickstarter .
it 's filling the gap of a good skateboard game and i ca n't wait to see it get fully fleshed out .
other than that i 've been dropping in for a few rounds of fortnite between other games .
the dude that got fired from the mueller probe was fired months ago .
trump had these card to play waiting for the perfect circumstances to play them and start draining the swamp .
it 's gon na be worldwide as we 've seen with saudi arabia .
i think on or before this wednesday some huge revelations are going to come out .
my reasoning is that there 's supposed to be some sort of announcement regarding the us embassy move to jerusalem .
we 're also slowly finding out about israeli intelligence more and more in relation to the corruption in our government .
there has been news in the past 2 days of jared kushner going to saudi arabia .
he went there to discuss the creation of a palestinian state backed by saudi and other nations .
i just feel like there has to be something that 's going to come out that 's going to fuck over israel .
i think by the end of all this we 're gon na see the entire zog and what they 've done be exposed .
the central goal of the negotiations as described by two people with knowledge of the talks is for an historic agreement featuring the creation of a palestinian state or territory backed financially by a number of countries including saudi arabia which could put tens of billions of dollars toward the effort .
you never know about an ally an ally can turn .
i 'm in agreement with most of what you said .
i would go elsewhere and give someone else my money .
then the business would have to either change their policy or shut down .
i have no right to force you to do anything .
when you 're forcing someone essentially at gunpoint really to do something you 're the bad guy .
fighterz will be the best followed by budokai 3 and attack of the saiyans .
underground is awesome too i believe season pass includes survival underground and last stand everything else was free update .
hitler was n't so bad after all he did kill hitler !
i just thought it was not much of an issue until now .
but i 'm starting to think because you 're pushing the russian interference '' narrative despite absolutely no proof having been shown that you get yours from leftist liberal sources .
korean exchanges are usually trading at 10-30 higher than non-korean ones because korea has currency export limitations but 6 seems like an excessive difference
the hype is dead em just ca n't leave behind his poppy shit
this is exactly what i 'm planning on doing !
despite my best efforts my wife is n't interested in gaming but our future children ?
daddy-son time will be flying around the universe hunting down pirates .
the biggest issue i had was holding my breath .
breath like you are running a marathon ... focus on the breathing not how great it feels .
odd i do n't see cut and paste '' in the top responses .
once upon a time in newspapers if you wanted to move paragraphs in a typed story you literally cut the story into pieces and took an uncut piece of paper and pasted the paragraphs in the correct order using glue or rubber cement .
ergo you would cut and paste '' to move paragraphs around .
it 's happened to me too on a different topic .
yeah there are subjects on here that are touchy .
what a magical time to be alive and watching hockey .
... if it is more than the barest port .
i think in any case there would have to be some exceptions made and i do n't think it 's unheard of that xavier would consider the idea of hiding mutants from general civilization if it means their protection .
the scarlet witch idea could possibly work as well but in what situation do you reverse that scenario ?
she said no more mutants '' not let 's create mutants '' .
i think that 's a much harder story to develop than the alternative shown in link that i suggested .
honestly no idea why dudes like that ref are even allowed to be in a game like this.. he obviously doesnt belong there
hey guys nip won oakland let 's wait and see how we do against the other teams before we make judgment
my so and i discussed a week visit once but i just could n't justify the travel time and cost for just 5 days worth of a visit 1 day travel each way basically so 7 days total granted i have to go overseas but still .
i suppose if my so had wanted me there very badly and he was putting up the money because that 's how he wanted to spend it then i would say ok .
same thing if that 's how you want to spend your money then so should eventually be ok with that .
i would n't do it if it means you ca n't afford a longer trip later though .
i could also potentially see an so feeling guilty .
or maybe feeling pressured to have plans and do something over the weekend with you .
so i 'd sort that kind of stuff out too what the expectations would be .
i 've seen one alteration to it that i like .
1d4 at full 1d8 above half and 1d12 below half .
no idea if it 's balanced but flavour wise i enjoy it .
it 's baby boomers fault that i ca n't afford my 1,200 apartment with my job at chipotle ! !
i mean there are apartments down the street for 500 a month but they 're older and uglier and the landlord said i 'm not allowed to smoke weed inside there so fuck that .
i believe this is from the youtuber peter brown link https youtu.be/4dydfmtwaxs

speaking as a moderator for this subreddit the ‘over 30 ' thing is a maturity level and attitude not a chronological age to be enforced .
it 's also not a hard and fast rule but a suggestion since we realize that sometimes younger people can learn from us older folks .
we know that ned can keep a secret even from us readers .
why would his memories need to be changed in order to keep that secret ?
i mean if you do n't know what each keystone does maybe you should take 5 minutes to go over them .
congratulations you cut the time it takes to pick your runes in half .
i change my runes before each game and literally takes 10-15 seconds .
yasuo is fairly well balanced at the moment but i think that from an overall design perspective zoe is the fairer champion .
she has significant strengths but also some glaring limitations and weakness that people do n't seem to want to exploit .
yasuo has strengths but nearly every one of his would-be weaknesses is shored up by windwall flow shield dashes and tornado .
on a micro scale yeah zoe 's e is probably more significant than any single thing in yasuo 's kit but when you put it all together in the context of an actual game it 's a lot easier to out macro game zoe and shut her down than it is to shut down yasuo or a lot of other mid laners .
i 'm solo queue that probably matters less because people just win by micro but riot ca n't just balance around micro and solo queue .
basically i think they are both fine but i would be surprised if riot kept going with the nerfs on zoe until after pro play starts up .
these changes should be enough to nominally appease the masses without making her worthless which is all riot needed to do while they wait for some better data to balance around instead of the reddit balance team .
when my parents and us by proxy lost their house because a certain place refused to budge on the mortgage despite my parents having a perfect record with them .
they got trapped in a bubble loan and signed that contract before the housing crisis etc .
they refused to refinance for them and so they went bankrupt instead .
i was starting school and working and dealing with the stress of not knowing where we were going to live .
my dad was out of work during all of this and our income was laughable .
we 're arguably better off now and i 'm looking to find my own housing arrangements but i 'm not going to lie we pass the old home every now and again .
someone else lives there and it pisses me off .
i 've never done this but i 'd imagine you would have to be closer to the city to see decent success ?
yes no one is saying that smartphones ca n't make voice calls but it really is n't their primary function .
i would say it 's possibly not even their secondary purpose .
they are way more frequently used for internet usage and texting than anything else .
they really are just mini computers that give you the option of voice calling someone
think of it like your applying an operator to both sides as a whole and the log operator is not linear and distributive so you cant separate it like that .
its confusing because most things you deal with are linear like multiplication where x y a ax ay .
l3 was very slow you 're playing a 3rd line move between two already strong groups
also d17 gives white strong shape and strengthens white 's influence on the upper side very much leading to the box '' variation a couple move later
d15 on the 4th line makes the left side bigger but because black is going to be busy playing on the right it is expected that it 's white who is going to be able to play there first and take that extra value
otherwise d2 is aji-keshi if you 're going to play e2 you should play it directly .
cats are un-loyal greedy and dont give a shit about you .

there is stratia liquid gold but it 's more of a creamy oil but fragrance free .
i 'm neither outraged nor offended i am however explaining how you 're a hypocrite .
so i suppose i contradicted my first comment there .
go over to r/buildapcforme and state your budget and requirements or list the sort of games/other software monitor you want to use ect and i can suggest some parts to start with .
once you have a part list on pcpartpicker.com make a new post here for review and suggestion .

it is also not detected in disk utility where i planned to partition it in two and install high sierra on one partition .
i 'm going to boot back into 10.12 and format the ssd and try again unless you know what the cause is

i love that league is becoming a bigger scence but the bubble makes the risk much higher and i dont like that .
it is n't as bad as owl though but seriously do n't people understand they are setting the system up for volatility .
yeah that 's why i might include the titles of the volumes in the future for clarity sake .
for example the title of volume six is the princess of the six flowers which would probably help you remember what the main arc is about .
yep northern california here and they been gone since 93-94 round here
i mean its already a choke point anyone above you has a major advantage .
you would also make a major risk scaling it as you would be vulnerable and have limited vision .
you can fill your butt much more using gold pellets instead of a solid object !

the biggest problem of our modern systems and networks is that they are trust based .

there are some more specific technical problems which iota has solved i.e .

i see you 're more in to stoner rock and those bands are more sludge metal minus monolord they 're a lot more stoner/doom .
i do n't know how much you listen to sludge and going from stoner to sludge for the first time can be a big jump .
the vocals are harsh minus the majority of the melvins work and if you do n't like punk i ca n't promise you 'll like sludge

you left them on the counter while you went to the back ?
one of the best ways to figure out where you 're at project capability wise is by replicating other projects you find online .
when i first started out in web design my teacher would always tell us to find a website we like and replicate it from scratch .
there are so many online resources for projects and cs education that its kind of overwhelming but you can definitely find resources that fit your learning style .
if i were in your shoes i would look up simple beginner projects for the language you 'll be starting out with at school or a simpler one and taking the projects step by step following videos/instructions/etc .
you 'll probably want to wait until your second or third semester to go for internships since they usually want some basic knowledge though a lot of internships offer training .
but until then working on your portfolio which btw can and should include literally any project big small common complex replicated-as long as its credited literally anything cs and networking either getting a cs part time job finding a cs job on campus doing research knowing your professors and cs department heads classmates etc .
will put you leaps ahead of others when it comes time to start applying to internships and eventually jobs .
i dislike a person so his family should suffer !

how often do you do a 7 day fast ?
i 'm wondering if a five day fast every month is possible .
disagree you get a completely different and should i say intended point of view of the events that transpire when you watch koyomi before owari .
there is a reason why nisio released koyomi before any of owari .
it gives the stuff that happens in the last couple of eps in koyomi more dramatic tension as you do not know how those things happen until you watch shinobu mail .
this is meant to be a mystery how koyomi/owari s gaen gets the sword that kills koyomi in koyomi dead '' nisio is at heart a mystery writer and the entire mystery is completely fumbled in the broadcast order .
here is a good vid explaining why light novel order is best

the fact that even he himself got assulted should hint to you that it 's got nothing to do with physical power .
it can only end when the creeps are more afraid for their careers than the people being assulted .
it feels sort of like a cross between manatide and primalfin but the 2 hp is a killer for sure .
sorry i 'm very new to this hobby waiting on my prusa mk2s kit to arrive but could you elaborate ?
can you just order a thicker bed material and just slap it on the build plate ?
so either through a bright engram or buying it with bright dust..
you are obviously bandwagoning you make all the same points that rey haters do .
it 's not the point my last comment made it clear .
people list the bad of the questions presented but not the possible good so even if you are n't complaining it still shines her in a negative light also it make 's it seem like people think the directors and disney do n't know what they are doing and are messing up the franchise .
it 's got to go somewhere and if it does n't everyone can light up their torches .
i 'd be down for that i 'm imagining a bunch of us not knowing each other though .
but i suppose if we all knew everyone else were infj it might be easy for us all to open up .
boredom is more of a killer than the public cares to know .
that 's actually something they teach in basic philosophy .
it 's a theory that says if something bad happens but it increases happiness more than it increases sadness than it results in higher overall happiness thus making it a good thing
in all seriousness though lots of guys and i dare say the majority are n't at all what you describe .
your personal opinion is skewed beyond belief probably because of the way you act around men .
the side of feminism that you 're leveraging is a self-cycling philosophy .
men appear weak or whatever around you probably cause no one gives a shit about you .

i bought a car in may and had my plates transferred from my old car to my new one .
finance i assume that 's who transfers plates made a typo and the registration is off by one letter .
or do i just need to go to the dmv and have them do it ?
is it with any game out of the box so to speak or do i need to do something ?
i have a vague recollection of there being a drop down list of games that have settings done for them .
i feel this draft fell off the tracks a bit early and i tried to steer it back on course but ended up on this deck .
it seems like from the draft selection it really could have went control priest .
i 'll run through my thoughts on each pick .
as you can see there 's a lot of question marks questionable picks .
anyone care to share their advice on this draft and changes in their thought process ?
6 dmg to clear minions in non ping class seems good .
8 buffs seem to good compared to low hp early minion
this might have been the turning point for the draft
14 2 drop vs removal this is pretty quality 2 drop though .
16 removal vs stats probably mistake here to take the wasp again .
17 all 3 competitive wolfie seems good with smaller minions .
moving away from late game passing bog creeper and blossoms
28 hard to pass sunwalker maybe i should have .
what we have to remember is crypto is still very much the wild west .
we ca n't put a limit on this stuff remember when everyone was screaming that btc could never hit 1,000 ?
these markets do n't follow normal trends and they sure do n't care about perceived market cap especially with a coin like xrp .
i think we are trying too hard to use traditional financial analysis to something completely new and unpredictable .
i think it will take us much much further than a lot of you guys predict
keep in mind all games are keys besides the steam gifts '' .
please make sure to make a reasonable trade if i do n't respond to your offer in 24 hours it means i 'm not interested .
please make sure to be clear on what you want what you want to trade or there might be some difficulties communicating .
i will also keep adding games at my discretion so do come back to check .

im not sure if this is a banned topic or not but we havent seen any gameplay or anything of this game but i use to play age of empires online i know it was a mobile type game but you had to pay microtransactions to unlock civlizations and also to unlock certain units and buildings that game was shut down do you guys think microsoft will learn from aoe online and not have game affecting microtransactions ?
im really worried with how bad this trend is it will make the game un fun ...

a late 2012 mini mac with a fresh copy of high sierra and latest macos server is the primary share point and open directory .
there are only 7 other imacs in the office usually only 4 or 5 concurrently .
now the set up is new before they all logged in locally and then used the same user account to access the share machine which was a nightmare security wise .
i 've switched over to the open directory method so there is a much better security setup but i have a really strange issue i ca n't lock down .
essentially after a while someones machine will suddenly become non responsive and anything they do they will just get the swirling beach ball and nothing will force quit or open .
i figured out that killing the smb service completely resolves this .
as soon as that service on the server gets stopped every imac comes back to life and then i just start the sharing service again .
about 15 second turn around but it happens every hour or so .
my question is pretty much what could be causing this issue .
i 've looked into it and ca n't really pin anything down .
i have access to logs and the setup is entirely done by me so i can get any information you need .
hi i have a mac hoopa ot mac id 11275 that i got from mdh20i here on pokemontrades and i am interested in what i could trade it for preferably gen vi events except 20th anniversary ones .
hey guys this is a complete list of all the items that i have that are all up for sale !
if you 're going to downvote me at least tell me why
so i played wow for about a week im from a brazil server and im certain that we have a bad fame in us servers but nothing i ca n't do about that and i saw that new races are coming next year .
right now im play as blood elf for the horde i liked the faction a lot but the void elf racials are really nice for casters kind of op for wath some friends said it to me .
right now i am already lvl 93 but you guys think it is worth going to the ally because of void elf racials benefith for mage ?
i pretend to buy change of race in the new allied races patch .
i want to think about this now to do not regreat in the future so i came here beg for you guys experience in the game xd
a world where all of the greatest in all dimensions have gathered .
three out of five were the strongest in their world and one of them was considered the strongest in history .
a crazy world where a wandering goblin would be above level 90 .
asgard otherwise known as heaven above the heavens . ''
in a world where all of the monsters of the worlds meet vulcan 's new adventure begins .
remember the guy i told you all from http www.hireandhack.com .
i asked him for an fb job for one of my friends .
but for this case he showed her proof then she paid for the upfront then paid the rest for the password or way into her targeted account .
now he has a partner with him who will try and do any hack together .
however you will then need to pay them an upfront payment first .
do not worry they will refund you if they ca n't complete it .
if they can do it and show you proof pay them the rest then .
i 've been putting off learning mountaineering skills primarily due to cost constraints but want to bite the bullet this winter
what would be the most cost efficient way for me to learn ?
my first idea is one of the courses at pyb or glenmore lodge but they 're very expensive and it looks like i would need to do a number of them to gain the skills i want .
my longer-term goal world be to ascend some peaks in the alps eventually without a guide .
my mountaineering experience thus far has been a couple of guided 5000/6000m peaks in south america where i used ice axes/crampons/crossed glaciers but was n't really shown techniques thoroughly .
i have lots of experience hill walking have done some scrambling and sport climb at 6x sadly not lead any trad yet .
i 've been scouring the internet to see what i need to learn and i think i have a relatively comprehensive list below any additions would be greatly appreciated .
so i 've been playing since late october and am now doing 64pl missions in canny .
i 'm going to break this down to a few main parts
first of this game has a brilliant concept behind it who does n't like zombies and not many games have done cartoony/likeable zombies .
even though i hate smashers that is really the only time i get excited and go oh crap this might break or make the game .
as i 've progressed the husks get harder with added elemental types and become more frequent in spawn .
i like and understand all of the husks except for the flinger this dude runs like forrest gump and you can legitimately chase him for an eternity .
the maps are pretty much the same throughout i thought the maps would be different as you progress but nope .
the hexyslavania was a welcome change and i was initially like this is real cool .
however this map and it 's foggyness made it difficult to see the mission targets which impacted the enjoyability factor .
fortnite definitely need to change textures and maps in the future
the characters this has been brought up many times before but pretty much majority of players play the same classes and some characters have negativity surrounding them i.e outlanders .
i know the dev team said ages ago they working on balancing but i do n't feel like enough has been done as very rarely do you see outlanders or constructors get high scores for anything other than building or utility .
i feel like each class of hero should have it 's own unique attack ability that 's somewhat decent .
dragon scorch and going commando dominate games and what do the constructor or outlander do ?
the weapons and traps part is the next thing i want to bring up .
i 've logged in 69 days i 've bought every single legendary troll loot and legendary ranged loot .
i only a couple days got my first legendary traps which are n't even that great or usable .
ive heard a few people say the same exact thing .
imagine the excitement of getting a legendary trap then getting absolute turd rolls on it which make it worse than your rare version of the same trap how is that fair especially considering you 've possibly spent money on the loot packs ?
annoyingly i 've got maybe 5 solid weapons with 2 being fortnitemares items .
with weapons i have many legendary weapons with a lot being useless i.e pistols and snipers which shoot too slow or do n't deal enough damage .
so you finally get that weapon you 've always wanted .
too bad sonny jim you got dealt the bad rolls card .
what i would suggest to possibly relieve frustration rather than a re roll system is when you are levelling up weapons or traps you get a choice of maybe 2 or 3 possible rolls at each stage so we can all build our own weapons of choice .
obviously this will make us feel better about our weapons and they can still work rng in and make us work to do this.. at the moment i feel like there 's too many different perks available which do n't add anything to weapons .
i do n't believe a re roll system would work as lately the rolls that i 've seen are horrendous if i got to re roll one perk the gun would still be disgusting .
on the flipside if fortnite made rolls that actually matched up with the weapon this would help as well .
if fortnite wants an active player base they need to look at this urgently as this directly impacts longevity of the game and enjoyability .
running around with awful weapons trying to take on husks and smashers ai n't fun .
i still need a solid nature type weapon and considering how much i 've paid and been active for last two months it 's getting silly .
with weapons they also need to buff up some weapons .
i feel like pistols and snipers minus the super shredder are really weak and not that usable .
either suffering from slow rates of fire or low damage .
i know there 's going to be some guy that argues that his 70 damage 40 crit chance and 40 crit damage with whatever elemental mixed with his outlander and perks is op .
your going to be having a laugh i never see anyone rolling with pistols or snipers in canny and the one time i did i had to look at the guy and ask him what he was doing he was getting swamped with husks and could n't handle it .
the only weapons i see are swords assault riffles the odd shotgun and explosive types .
there is n't much variety in weapons with what works so i feel like pistols and snipers either need to have increased mags/damage/fire rate and this could also be applicable to other weapons like shotties which some have 2 shots before reloading .
i will happily guess 95 of all weapons get trashed due to either being a bad weapon to start with or having trash rolls .
people may laugh but think of black ops zombies you can almost pick up any weapon and do decently in it with some weapons being godly.. if fortnite transferred it 's weapons to black ops we would being hitting the mystery box over and over and over it 's just not viable .
there needs to be a reset button on this or an ability to customize it on the basis of hero 's along with being able to save hero 's with tactical and support hero's.. apparently it 's not possible to buy every single skill and you will miss out on some things .
so in my short time playing i 've had 3 major issues with the last one slowly becoming more common on ps4 .
the worst of the 3 issues is the game freezing then needing to close the ap then start it again just for it to freeze again on the entitlements page .
i understand it 's still early access and they are still developing it so there will be issues that 's fine i understand that .
but when you raise a ticket and get no response for over a week and the email back is i hope this issue is fixed let us know if it is n't .
that 's the type of service that gives you ideas .
a week to reply are they that busy with other players bugs and issues .
i had to uninstall/reinstall game to fix which to me means bad coding unless someone with a bit more tech savvy wants to take a stab in the dark .
this kind of cheeses me off a lot there was a post on facebook about how pc players were being impacted by freezes etc and they worked on it right away and fixed it ?
the amount of small bugs/glitches that are happening are insane i 've never known a game to have so many issues .
new player joins lobby lag new player joins game lag .
the names of players and their health player do n't always show up how am i meant to report people for either acting like idiots or saying vile stuff ?
storm chests not completing as a mist monster did n't appear .
getting stuck in-between floors and buildings and not being able to escape easily .
using an ability and either being hit a split second before or having your energy taken off you due to nature affliction and resulting in not being able to use that ability for whatever the cooldown period is .
the amount of support/tech bonuses that do n't actually work .
this is n't even all the bugs there are but the ones i can think off the top of my head .
i understand that fixing some of these things can take time as i know fixing one thing can effect something somewhere else so there needs to be testing and sufficent testing at that before patches etc are launched .
some patches do appear to cause more issues than stuff they fix/add to the game .
one last thing which they do need to fix is the player pool .
i 'm guessing with how they 've reduced the amount of missions available to people to play recently that it 's an effort to get fuller lobbies on games which i understand however its had some negatives as well i honestly feel like people are playing less now as there are less fun missions available and sometimes you do n't even have your actual quest available at all .
it 's quite often i struggle to find a game with anyone for one of the missions i need to do or sometimes any mission at my pl .
this would put a lot of players off as why bother trying to do a hard mission solo when your not going to have people helping you minus defenders .
who take your resources and ca n't fix/add walls so are n't even on par as a person.. maybe this is why we are seeing so many underpowered by 20-30 people in higher missions .
i hope epic are n't just waiting for people to buy the game or for people who are n't as progressed to push further into the game as this again will likely deter people from playing in the later stages of the game .
the thing i like most about this game is the community i 'll happily say 90 of the community are people i enjoy playing with and do n't mind helping out with their ssds or some other type of mission.. there are of course the bad nuts but no need to talk about them as epic ca n't really control them lol .
i hope the community expands and more people get hooked on this game but there are things that need to be sorted first before this game can truly be amazing .
all in all this may seem negative but the game is awesome and surprisingly has n't lost it 's replayability factor yet.. if anyone wants to post any comments feel free
once again looking to drop off katie if anyone can help ?
i had a quick go on the steep olympics open beta and quite enjoyed it but i have a few questions regarding tricks .
2 can the parks/ramps used in events be accessed outside events in free roam ?
can i mess about on them without having to repeat the event over and over ?
3 does the olympics dlc give access to many more ramps/snow parks etc ?
then i hooked it up to a win 7 pc to backup some stuff .
now it is n't being picked up by win 10 .
device manager seems to indicate it 's 'there ' and functioning but i ca n't see it in 'my computer ' with the other drives .
typically ppl say to use disk management and follow the setup but wo n't that reformat or make me lose all my data ?
atlanta falcons and new orleans saints are facing each other on this 7th december .
nbc nfln and amazon video will broadcast this game live .
falcons and saints are both professional american football team .
they play in the national football league nfl as a member of the league 's national football conference nfc south division .
the venue of this game mercedes-benz superdome is the saint 's home stadium .
but saints have lost 50 games by winning 45 games against falcons .
so it can be said that the game between the saints and the falcons is going to be a great unpredictable competition .
i wait and wait and wait but this time my sadness and anxiety does n't go away .
i hate myself for crying publicly every day at the street or cafés .
sometimes i think that an angel will appear to help me for being crying so much .
i was supposed to have got my medicine about a month ago .
but then the doctor wanted to verify some stuff about my heart .
i do n't have a heartproblem but i have another syndrome that sometimes affects the heart and the doctor just wanted to make sure everything is fine .
the original plan was to get the medicine and then a month after that have a check up to see how it 's going ... well as i have n't recieved any medicine yet i 've still got the problem of putting things off and forgetting stuff ...
so the nurse i was supposed to meet today called to get a new appointment .
i wont do the heart test until late december so i did n't get an appointment but that 'll sort itself out .
i 'm not angry or annoyed at myself for putting it off .
shoud i let the battery drain to 0 and charge it from there ?
or plug it in right when i get it and let it charge to 100 before using my phone ?
so apparently i 'm suspended for hate speech like what the shit apparently from some incident that occurred like 6 days ago wich is impossible i 've only have used it twice from then and only with friends in party chat unless one of them reported me because they think there sum kinda funny cunts i 've been banned for like no reason

simply irresistible '' by robert palmer song link here https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=urgw_cogwa8
she 's a craze you 'd endorse she 's a powerful force
you 're obliged to conform when there 's no other course
she 's a natural law and she leaves me in awe
she used to look good to me but now i find her
she 's a craze you 'd endorse she 's a powerful force
you 're obliged to conform when there 's no other course
she used to look good to me but now i find her
she 's all mine there 's no other way to go
i noted someone else called monika irresistible '' which made me think of this song and when i went to listen to it i realized it worked pretty well .
i 'm not specifically on any team but i thought it was funny enough to post it .
has anyone been able to remap the reset phone key now that white noise is out ?
it 's defaulted to '5 ' and changing anything referencing '5 ' in the customize menu does not change the default key mapped for resetting your phone .
i 've got a razer mmo mouse with 1 12 on the side of the mouse and '5 ' is mapped to lean right for me .
meaning i can not lean right now when my phone goes off .

my ex girlfriend and i have been dating for the past 3 years she broke up with me late august over my behavior .
we had a pretty consistant pleasant relationship we share pretty much all the same interests tastes get along super well and have great sex etc but throughout the last year we slowly got too comfortable/bored with things .
i was involved in a play starting late summer through august and i developed a crush on a girl who was also acting in the show meanwhile my gf was working on the production as well .
i got lost in my infatuation with this girl which led me to question my satisfaction with my girlfriend .
i confessed to my gf that i had developed feelings for the other girl which deeply upset her and i made promises to fix things between us and ignore my infatuation towards the girl .
the next day i made my official move to college and would be out of town for the week .
about a week later the play came to a close and i chose to handwrite and give to the girl a confessional letter detailing my feelings .
at the time i had decided that my infatuation meant that this girl could make me happier than my present girlfriend/relationship and i dealt with things impulsively .
my girlfriend had looked through my phone that day and came across text messages from me to the girl expressing my feelings earlier in the week .
she took this as 'emotional cheating ' and was extremely upset and cried in front of me .
the following day i went back to college and received a phone call from my gf 's mom saying that she had been taken to the hospital after attempting suicide .
the next morning i emailed her a letter i had typed up telling her that she was an amazing person and that i was sorry if i had put her through anything .
i did n't bring up anything specific just made sure to tell her she was valued and that i felt sorry .
she did n't respond to me until the end of the week when i asked her to meet up with me to talk and she agreed .
we sat down and she read aloud a letter that she had wrote telling me that i was a selfish coward for cheating putting her through the situation and she told me explicitly about her suicide attempt .
she made sure to tell me that her attempt was a culmination of many factors including depression but also my betrayal to her .
she explicitly broke up with me saying that she did n't deserve what i did to her and that i should be ashamed of myself .
weeks later in september i was feeling regret for what happened and i realized that my feelings for the other girl were just a crush and i had overestimated my infatuation and i missed my ex .
i met with the girl twice to explain to her what had happened to my relationship and that i was depressed and planned on being single for a long time .
the only detail i changed when i told her how things went down was that the reason for my gf being upset was that i was n't sure if i was still in love '' with her .
i was n't clear enough with this other girl with my feelings for her as i still have a crush but realize it 's not serious and have no intention to pursue her but i feel as if i am somehow leading her on by not making that clear enough .
mid october my girlfriend invited my out in my college town to see a show and we enjoyed ourselves and had a great time together .
i confessed to her that i gave the girl a letter that my actions were a mistake i regretted things and that i missed her and have been dwelling on our breakup .
she was similarly upset over things and we cried together over expressing our feelings .
since then we agreed to give each other space only talking every few weeks in a friendly manner but eventually we realized we still had feelings for one another and it was making things difficult .
the last weekend of november we had a serious talk over getting back together and fixing things between us .
we agreed that we both wanted to get back together but would take the next several weeks to gain perspective from friends and think things over .
she has been seeing a therapist since her attempt and has told me repeatedly that she does not blame me for wanting to commit suicide however i still feel like i am blaming myself especially for neglecting her immediately afterwards besides the email .
i have been very depressed and unhappy with myself since early in the year and i realize now that i was associating my personal unhappiness with our relationship which was wrong .
we both are leaning towards taking time apart for personal growth before we get back together but just how long should that take ?
and is it right for us to contact each other during time apart ?
i do n't know if i could be comfortable cutting contact with her and possibly drifting apart from each other .
i want her to be happy but it 's upsetting to imagine her moving on with someone else .
my other issue is that she still mistrusts me over my situation/continued friendship with the other girl .
i just have n't brought myself to cutting things off with her because i 'm scared to do so over hurting her feelings and making a big deal out of it .
i am also scared of handling things the wrong way again and i do n't want to disappoint myself or anyone else .
i occasionally see her as she is involved in productions at my parent 's place of work .
i still feel as though i have a crush although i do n't see myself pursuing her and i have tried to make that clear to my ex but she still does n't trust me .
how do i go about cutting things off with the girl and what is the right moment to do it ?
tl dr my ex girlfriend wants me to cut things off with a crush i emotionally cheated on her with how do i go about fixing things ?
i 'm fairly young little under 25 started a successful business and i plan on investing a small amount to begin with .
i did some reading and people generally have positive input on schwab 's tdfs .
given my age and the fact that my business is growing so i will be able to put more in investments in the future do you thing this is a good idea ?
i would like to start with 3,000 is it too little ?
what are the pros and cons of this type of fund ?
people who have experience with schwab 's tdf are welcome to share .
ryzen 1600x 16gb ddr4 g-skill memory samsung ssd asrock ab350m pro4 mbd .
they work just fine in both usb 2.0 and 3.0 ports .
however when when windows 7 boots which is booting from a usb disc drive it will not see my keyboard or mouse so i can not proceed with the installation .
also the hardware monitor in the mbd settings shows ryzen to be 52 c. is that normal ?
i have this tin foil hat idea floating around in my head for a few days and i want to know what you guys think .
they way i understand it is that there are infinite amount of possible timelines and there is one true main timeline that we are in .
there are no alternate timelines because they did n't exist or do n't matter to our timeline until bronze/infinite dragonflight finds them .
somewhat like schrodinger 's cat where you do n't know whether the cat is alive or not .
heck you would n't even know what 's in there if you 're not the one that put it in .
what infinite dragon flight is trying to accomplish is getting into for a lack of better description an alternate time thread .
then attach it back into the one time rope '' that matters and thus change the outcome of events after that point .
let 's suppose that this can actually happen if infinite dragonflight had succeeded because otherwise it would n't be necessary for us to stop them .
more specifically after wrathion ate lei shen 's heart .
he saw a universe with infinite planets and one shines above all that is azeroth .
and he said we must rebuild the final titan .
but now rebuild seems to be a weird word of choice to me .
a titan starts out as a ball of energy .
because it 's so strong that it forms matter around it for protection as it sleeps .
what is built is azeroth the planet not azeroth the titan .
could it be possible that the message from aman'thul is that the planet needs to be rebuilt to get rid of the corruption but wrathion incorrectly interpreted it as the titan ?
in ulduar after algalon 's analysis the result turns out that there 's systemic corruption happening on azeroth .
he sent code omega to trigger re-origination and gave us code to cancel it because we defeated him which makes him think that his calculation was wrong .
his calculation here has nothing to do with the corruption of azeroth .
his calculation is referring to that there 's no possible way for us to defeat him .
but the analysis of corruption is done by the titan machine not algalon .
he 's only there to read the result and then send a code to the forge of origination accordingly .
i find myself running into these two words very often .
everything in warcraft seems to be in a loop of some sort .
there 's naaru 's light/void cycle cycle of hatred norzdomu 's loop ... something that has happened before is very much likely to happen once again with variation ofc .
what if in the past omega was successfully sent to forge of origination and the corruption was wipe out with life temporarily .
life starts to originate as it did and old gods restart corrupting things .
us being sentient not driven by instinct that 's basically designed by nature/evolution but driven by our own freewill .
could that be the key to stop the corruption ?
could it be what it takes to break the loop ?
if us breaking the loop is the good outcome .
then there can be a bad way to break it as well .
she will be the void titan that devours the universe and everything will be gone .
based on the analysis in ulduar it 's certainly heading that way .
the forge of origination 's power will only wipe out the corruption but not the old gods .
titan 's failsafe is only a containment not a solution .
the old god has already embed themselves deep in azeroth .
so much so that when aman'thul ripped y'shaarj off the planet .
what if us defeating alaglon is the proof that we at least have the ability to challenge the old gods before they take root ?
what if we 're meant to travel to one of the threads of time before it gets in the cycle and defeat the old gods without harming azeroth .
and then attach that thread back to the main timeline so that there wont be any corruption that basically ca n't be stopped ?
it 's safe to assume that like bronze/infinite dragonflight he can see all the different time threads .
however being a cosmic entity he can not interact with time and manipulate events within .
if this was possible the void lords would have used it to corrupt a titan before resistance was possible .
in order to get to a place in another timeline .
a pocket dimension needs to be created to contain it .
these pocket dimension simply ca n't contain a titan or void lord .
as cosmic beings they 're bound to the one true timeline .
simply put there has n't been anyone that 's capable of defeating old gods just yet .
we know that titan construct ca n't stand against old gods maybe because they do n't have the freewill to the degree that we do to consciously fight against old gods ' whisper ? .
only until now as the heroes of azeroth we showed that at least we might stand a chance against old gods at their full strength .
we might need to use bronze dragonflights power to go back to the point before old gods take root on azeroth and stop corruption from even happening .
edit 2 i got some new ideas thanks to the comments !
what happens in the one true timeline if it was left untouched ?
as one of the replies mentioned the light perceives the universe to have one true timeline that needs to be kept .
oddly enough our nature lines up more with the void due to having freewill .
after we finished ulduar we can hear ronin 's speech in dalaran .
in which he mentioned something along the line with this world has not gone according to the titan 's plan .
since the titans or at least aman'thul seem to want everything to go along with the timeline .
then it probably means life and corruption will continously be wiped out until azeroth is awakened ?
illidan straight up rejected xe'ra 's prophecy which i assume is what would happen in the one true timeline and took his fate in his own hand .
we probably feel the same way as illidan if we were told that we need to be wiped out for the greater good .
we also do n't want to be eaten by the void titan .
so some drastic measure needs to be taken which is erase the corruption from existence by altering the past ?
i also had this idea that the titans and naaru are some kind of being that zealously follow the one true timeline even if it means being devoured by void titan in the end .
but that seems a little bit over the top .

i helped a 98 year old friend set up his new iphone x on monday .
after playing with his new iphone x all day i agree it 's a beautiful phone .
also his old phone an iphone 6 plus was now three years old .
my iphone 7 plus is less than one year old .
and after trying the iphone x there are a couple of show stoppers for me that i want to see changed before i would consider upgrading
right now the overall screen size of the iphone x is smaller than the iphone 7 or 8 plus .
most annoying to me when i was trying it is that because it is narrower the keyboard is narrower so it is harder to type on than with my iphone 7 plus .
that crazy new way of using face id to confirm purchases by double-clicking a mechanical button on the right side .
on my iphone 7 plus that button is just used for sleep/power .
on the iphone x it is used for three things sleep/power activating siri and also to confirm purchases .
so instead of moving away from buttons currently the button on the iphone 7 plus is not a mechanical button it is haptic touch and perfect apple has moved backwards i think to require even more use than usual of a mechanical button .
and it 's in an awkward position for what it does .
so i 'm hoping that next year some new iphone x plus will solve these issues .
let 's say one relocates intercooler functionality from the top '' of the engine to the front '' of the engine .
what purpose does the hood scoop have after such a change ?
ok so i was in restaurant and this song came on and the music video was playing as well it was a good song from what i can remember but i could n't hear any lyrics really but i do remember the main part in the music video .
the song was maybe some sort of club edm type music it was definitely up beat .
but the guy singing i think he had glasses on but he had gold glitter/rhinstones all over his face that is the only thing i can remember i assume it 's a newer song .
i did n't want to live off campus this year because it did n't make sense for me to pay for rent to a house i was n't going to be living in during the summer months
are there and houses or apartments in new brunswick that charge rent starting like september or is this an imaginary idea i 've got going on here ?

setting up hass.io for the first time on a rpi3 and after installing via etcher and setting up the config file for a static ip i plugged it in and got the splash screen but i ca n't connect via the web access .
i have a habit of using my parking brake every time i park .
i once drive a few meters with it on and it made the parking brake lever loose but it still worked .
after i changed the brake pads on the back the lever reset '' to normal .
drove fine for a while until i accidentally did it again a few months later then again it was just a loose lever .
i drove with it on again today and now the parking brake does n't work at all and the lever is completely loose .
the parking brake on this car is just the rear brakes .
the pads and rotors look fine it was only a few meters but the fact that the lever does n't work but it did after changing the pads makes me think it 's not a tension problem but something else .
there is a lot of meat left on the pads and rotors it 's only been about 4 months since they were changed there 's no way i wore that much after a few meters and they still look fine .
anyone have any troubleshooting ideas or experience with this or should i just take off the wheels and see why changing the brake pads fixed this the first time .
with the dual clutch you can have launch control and faster shifting why does n't the s5 have the dual clutch transmission ?

i was watching raw on hulu and jason jordan 's bandaged leg stood out to me .
i think it would be cool to play up the leg injury and have him tag with kurt angle in a match at royal rumble .
then do the classic owen turning heel move on bret .
have jason try to prove his worth and not make a critical tag and then lose when his leg gives out .
kurt frustrated then kicks it out from under him .
i 'm trying to model the demand for m1 in the us and upon running an engle-granger for my variables none of them are cointegrated and they all contain unit roots ?
can i still use ardl to estimate the model or is there a fix i need to continue ?
if i can test it out before buying what steps should i do to check the monitor ?
hi all i ran a bunch of tests and here are my results
i 'm transferring from a us bank and coinbase/gdax is another us bank in california
all transfers were made throughout the day time does n't matter
treat any federal holiday as if it 's a weekend
wire deposit to coinbase/gdax took less than 2 hours likely faster since i was n't sure exactly when my bank sent the wire
these have been my results as i noticed by my own transfers plus i ran a few dozen tests at various times .
i 'm a bit confused when looking at the content graph data after executing this action .
all of my workflows fetched have today 's date/time stamp .
i was expecting to see a true value when it was actually created updated .
i 'm using the magic variable my workflows creation date and my workflows last modified date .
i 'd love to mine more information on this content type and use it in some reports .
now i understand i 'm going to get a million downvotes for having a different opinion but i do n't really care .
squad battles has the possibly worst combination of gameplay to leaderboards '' in ai focused gameplay
it 's a competitive leaderboard game mode dependent on your experience against ai controlled teams .
dynamic difficulty and ai cheating/scripting whatever you refer to it as
in other games when there 's leaderboards involved for who can master a level they obviously pick the hardest difficulty .
now anyone who picks the hardest difficulty in these games are all having the same experience of ai power/difficulty .
anyone who tries to beat the halo campaign on the highest difficulty are against the same cpu as anyone else on that difficulty .
squad battles follows a similar old school ranking system but is totally bullshit compared to its changing gameplay .
i 'm not someone who 's coming from semi pro and tried ultimate once and now raging .
i play my matches on legendary and have success but i 'm not immune to the bullshit this game brings .
in a competitive leaderboard focused game mode it makes no sense that we can have 9/10 matches a week against a 67 rated 59 chem team but that one time the gameplay and ai are clearly on ultimate or some hybrid form .
dynamic difficulty would n't be a problem if the rewards were from a certain number of wins and independent of other fut players .
instead we have a system competing with others despite some daily sets being totally inconsistent difficulties .
i 'm honestly confused how this game mode makes it long haul if ea are n't willing to remove dynamic difficulty or change the structure .
squad battles was a great idea but it should n't run in sync with other players when difficulty does n't even make sense .
if i 'm competing for elite 1 why is it fair that i have an easy 8-0 win against a shitty squad but that similar squad smashes someone else 2-0 ?
it 's like i played against a semi pro squad and some others played an ultimate team
tldr dynamic difficulty and a player based leaderboard system rewarding us with prizes do n't add up .
so i recently picked up the highlander for the sole purpose of experiencing the 'buff ma class ' tears .
it turns out that the offensive emote is actually scary to players in the middle of combat and i 'm able to guardbreak or parry false reaction .
now here 's a buff to write your homecountry about
make the emote cost a miniscule amount stamina and make its total effect a feint in your current stance direction .
i 've been trying to buy the mi a1 from the solution shop but when i try to calculate shipping it says
please ensure that your address has been entered correctly or contact us if you need any help .
the mi 5x and seems to be related to the a1 shipping from the hong kong warehouse rather than the china warehouse .
i 've been trying to buy it for a few days now and i might end up buying a different phone in my country if it does n't get resolved
are there any fansites that do n't edit pictures of the boys ?
if i get married on 12/21/17 what will happen ?
i 've heard that i would get deported because it takes two weeks for the government to actually receive my legal marriage paperwork .
do i have to get married before 12/17 two weeks before end of month in order to stay in the country while my marriage petition is being processed ?
if not does it matter if i get married on 12/1 or 12/30 ?
see previous review for more info on the new format .
expectations were high for the 2017 season so where did it all go wrong ?
why did the raiders struggle so badly in close games in 2017 lost 8 games by 6 or less ?
does the team seem to be heading in the right direction ?
i only got 47 head shots with the p08 being in my top 5 most gun kills .
i see all these people with diamond pistols and im like how ?
i been going for a head shot or 2 a game in hard core and letting anything after that come naturally .
and im not even sure if im good enough to unlock the extra camos after the headshots .
does any one got any tips to make it easier ?
citing a democratic official minnesota public radio is reporting that embattled sen. al franken is set to resign https www.mprnews.org/story/2017/12/06/senator-al-franken-to-resign tomorrow as the result of a string of harassment allegations made against him .
this seems likely considering that over two dozen democratic senators including minority leader chuck schumer have called on franken to resign https www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/full-list-senators-call-for-al-franken-to-resign-282175 .
so if franken does indeed announce his resignation tomorrow who do you think will be appointed to fill his seat until next november ?
do you think that adding one more senate race into the mix will have an impact on the 2018 midterms ?
do you think this will affect the race there or the political future of roy moore whose victory is looking increasingly likely ?
update politico reports https www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/al-franken-senate-smith-211125 that minnesota lt. gov .
she 's not expected to run for the rest of franken 's term but just serce until next year 's elections .
the cosmic gods are rulers of entropy and void promoting humility and sombre devotion .
they are also gods of travel ministering to the myriad wastrels and wanderers across the spheres .
even still they are the gods of mutability and change representing the grandeur and mystery of wildspace .
the cosmic domain deals in many things and is interpreted differently on the countless planets where deities are honored .
the variety is due in part to how relatively recently discovered spelljamming is .
when you choose this domain at 1st level you gain the mage hand cantrip .
also at 1st level you have minor control over the forces which direct the cosmos .
as an action you may select one medium size or smaller target .
it must make a strength saving throw or be moved 10 ' away from you towards you or straight upwards .
if the target is moved straight upward it remains at this elevation for one minute .
it may repeat the saving throw to return to the ground at the end of each of its turns .
a creature can be lifted no more than 20 ' with uses of this feature .
you may use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier minimum of once .
you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest .
starting at 2nd level you may use your channel divinity to puncture reality throwing allies out of harm 's way .
when a creature other than yourself is damaged within 30 ' of you you may present your holy symbol using a reaction to move them up to their movement speed in any direction .
beginning at 6th level you may affect two targets per use of your manipulate gravity feature .
in addition you may expend additional uses of your manipulate gravity feature to affect larger targets .
for each use spent above the first you may affect one size category larger a target .
you may not affect two targets if you choose to expend uses in this way .
starting at 8th level you add your wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip .
beginning at 17th level you can create a rift in the universe similar to a black hole .
as an action you place a 5'x5 ' tear in an area within sight .
this tear lasts for 1 minute and the area 10 ' around it on all sides is considered difficult terrain .
all creatures who start their turns within this terrain must make a strength saving throw .
on a failure they take 4d8 force damage and are pulled 5 ' towards the rift .
on a success they take half as much damage and are not pulled .
a creature within the tear 's space makes no save .
you may use this ability once per long rest .
i am a 21 year old college student and am planning on taking next semester off to do some work in africa .
i am hoping to take the opportunity while i am less connected to the internet to learn more about the wonderful game of chess and develop the ability to be an alright chess player .
i really have n't played much of any chess before but i have recently become really interested in trying to become as skilled as possible at it .
so i am just wondering what book s i should get to read ?
so for my first treatment that laser felt like a pretty intense stab into my skin .
my body tensed up and i was shaking like a leaf .
my laser tech felt bad and turned the setting down a notch .
i was still pretty tense but it was at least more bearable pain wise .
part of me chalks up the pain to my autism which has a way of playing with my sense of sensory intensity at the worst of times .
being on hrt for just short of 2 months is another suspect as i suspect it might have made my skin a bit more susceptible to pain .
i look forward to the next session 6 weeks from now and i 'm hopeful for good results .
i just hope i 'm less of a wimp next time .

i 'm one of the rare cases of retinal toxicity due to plaquenil .
it caused my retinas to thin and diminished my vision quite a bit .
i was told at first that glasses could n't correct my issues so i 've dealt with bad vision for 5 years .
i saw a new retina specialist recently who told me to see an optometrist and despite all odds i can correct my vision back to 20/20 with the help of glasses !
so i was playing showdown with my maxed colt trying to push him to rank 17 before the update .
i see this brock at the very beginning shooting some boxes .
he seems friendly enough and he spins at me so i think why not ? and spin back .
we collect a few boxes two each then go on to face the world .
as it turns out everyone has decided to team with each other .
there 's a barmike team a primo+bull and an assorted team of everyone else .
ares spares my life not once but twice when i was on low health and he could have killed me and gotten away with it .
towards the end there 's us a spike and another brock and a dynamike getting free charges on all 4 of us .
for some reason the 7 elixir spike that had his super charged up decided not to kill all 3 of us at once and instead help attack the dynamike .
after he dies i 'm mentally preparing to die because everyone else has their super charged .
i see spike 's circle flash yellow and i brace myself .
but instead of dying the spike does that button spam thing where you flash your circle and pretty soon everybody is spinning in circles and nobody has died .
i thought to myself is there something i 'm missing here ?
but alas all good things come to an end and this one happened when the other brock used his super either on purpose or accidentally towards all of us in a really small area .
of course both the other brawlers use their super so i 'm pretty much dead and yes i die first .
but i managed to see the aftermath and ares somehow came out alive .
i 'm glad karma found a way to repay him for all the debt i owe him .

i 'm going to type what this graph illustrates for those of you who see it as just a group of overwatch characters .
is there a quick way to see who has liked or commented on your posts in the past few months ?
i have a client who wants to unfriend anyone who has not liked or commented on her stuff recently .
instead of manually going through every post and keeping a list and then unfriending anyone not on the list
i have done a bunch of searches but not finding anything that works .
so that i do n't get stopped 10 more times .
i understand it 's your job to ask anyone who makes eye contact but please no more .
my wife and i the first thing through the turn style day 1 got stopped and asked about 10 questions and of course we answered all of them but it did take away some of the magic of our first moments after scanning our ticket .
about 1 hour later my wife answered 5 more questions from someone else in the park .
this really is n't a major complaint just needed to vent .
as i understand it i 'd rather not sit and mine one single coin because different algos become more profitable than others randomly .

not sure if it would be appropriate for the situation unless you 're in immediate and severe danger but it could be a possibility .
true but vetoing the deal means a hard brexit which will hurt the republic particularly hard .
they 've misjudged the situation and the new taisearch seems to not have much experience of ni and it 's politics .
i think they thought they could use the eu to put pressure to force a united ireland and it went to their heads and they lost sight of reality .
spain made the same calculation initially with gibraltar and then backed down because catalonia happened and the last thing they wanted was brexit britain acknowledging catalonia and giving them a trade deal .
yeah they 're angry that the hate is n't reciprocal .
they 're definitely a rivalry but they will always be second tier to osu .

they ca n't deal with the fact they will never truly be on our level .
we finally got a full mystery '' box set and then a year or 2 later got a 3rd season .
so even if they do release a full set with season 3 there 's still a chance we may get a season 4 a few years later

the denna thing is a fairly minor character and you could argue the toss with the other names but a fantasy publisher and probably an agent too is going to flag arthus as potentially distracting for a reader never mind potentially infringing .
when there are dozens of other possibilities for a name then being stubborn about something so obviously huge particularly when in the op 's original draft of the synopsis when it was paired with anduin which was recognisable both as a river from tolkien and from wow as well and the alternative alduin was from skyrim is not worth the heartache .
i 've changed a lot of names recently because i 'm getting serious about querying my books and the word salad i invented as a teenager no longer seems appealing .
considering your audience and potential clashes with other franchises is probably better than being stubborn .
i am a programmer myself that should n't be a problem
i think some of my other favorites are the rito zora sheikah and the minish or picori .
they 're a really interesting race with the potential to wield magic that could almost rival that of the triforce .
and one of my all time favorite zelda villains vaati was a member of the minish .
they 're also similar to the twili a race from another realm and it makes me wonder what their own realm looks like since we do n't really get a chance to see it .
majora 's mask is pretty high up there for me as well .
i still think it 's a really good game but its formula is so different that it does n't really feel like a zelda game a lot of the time .
i 'm so bad at putting in my food if i know it 's keto and really need to up my game
macgill would have a say if he played more tests but as it is he is n't worthy of mentioning in the same breath as kumble nor will he be considered on par with lyon .
on par to be making the same amount fb does and they never go offline .

it is a hard-copy only you will have to wait for shipping they have only 2 left and no previous reviews doubt they had more they do claim to have a return policy read more on that just in case the game does n't work .
why the same time if i can hold it longer ?
i am currently listening to cage the elephant trouble as i saw this and read these comments .

spurs keep their souls in a soulbox so they ca n't leave without pop 's consent .
it does n't throw a wrench in any other developed nation though .
most of them require some government intervention though because healthcare is not something that can be universal from the free market alone .
at some income point you would be giving charity no matter what and that would be a bad business model because other companies would just offer a cheaper option due to not paying for people who ca n't afford it .
the question is how do you maintain some level of competition while providing that healthcare universally .
honestly i 'm not expert enough to say the exact plan that 's best .
however if i were an expert i would have dozens of possible solutions to pick and choose from and then change to fit the american economy .
i do n't believe that being unable to afford healthcare or going into bankruptcy due to illness is something that should occur in the largest economy in the world personally .
it 's not a freedom to not afford healthcare .
so just from a clemson perspective the problem with adding a 9th acc game is it would likely weaken their ooc scheduling .
the town of clemson sc depends on clemson having 7 home games .
there are many small businesses that would close if it were n't for football weekends .
the scheduling philosophy now for clemson is to play south carolina and another power 5 teams auburn texas a m notre dame .
if a 9th acc game is added they would likely have to drop that 2nd power 5 game to ensure they had 7 home games .
i 'm not sure how beneficial it would have been for clemson or for cfb if clemson did n't play auburn but instead played duke or virginia .
so from clemson 's perspective we would likely be facing a lesser opponent in most years with an additional acc game than we would if we could just keep scheduling attractive opponents from the sec or other power 5 conferences .
you guys invented the word for workplace violence trust me i believe you .
maybe you 're actually nervous and trying to convince yourself that all will be fine ?

we all knew coo was n't going to change the game as it was literally built side by side .
so if this is going to be the continued business practice i 'm out .

in my experience whatever the parents say has no baring on the proposal itself .
it 's more to make them feel involved and show respect .

how can she be treated without a proper diagnosis ? ?
get someone to take her to a good psychiatrist who 'll be able to tell you about the treatment options way better than any of us .
now i 'm not entirely sure about psychiatrists in lhr but if you know doctors through family or friends just ask around they 'll recommend you a good one or go to a general physician ask for a referral .

if you said that i could give an alibi and demonstrate that i do n't have the technical knowledge to pull that off .
in a court of law i would not like to be responsible for having those things and luckily for me i 'm not .

missing covers in outdoor lighting is incredibly common yet people are n't constantly getting electrocuted .

what i mean is that i ca n't achieve stable frame rate and sometimes do n't even hit 60 .
before upgrading my monitor my pc would never dip below 60fps and now that i have the new monitor for some reason it will flux from 144 to 90 to 130 to 50 to 30 then back to 111 .
i cant get it to be stable at any locked framrate unless i turn resolution down and go to full screen .

these lanes the way they are set up now do n't solve congestion though .
the peach pass lane in atlanta is 10-15 every single day at the time i drive in .
the problem also mentioned in the article is that no one is actually paying the toll .
i get to drive in that lane for free because i have an electric vehicle .
the lane is jam packed with public and private busses work trucks commuter vans and electric vehicles .
at this point the peach pass lane is only marginally faster than the normal lanes while raising little revenue .
it would be political suicide but i would love to see an additional lane or two converted to toll lanes and the things that are now exemptions evs and multi-passenger vehicles be changed to a discount .
then since anyone who uses the lane is actually paying money some revenue could actually be raised .
that money could be earmarked to subsidize and improve mass-transit options .
ryan is lazy and can be passive aggressive and is generally pretty useless but adam is deliberate in his attempts to make other people 's lives worse and sometimes even seems to relish it .

the law clearly states that you need consent of all parties in a two party consent state let 's use california .
implied consent is when customer service calls you and says this call may be recorded blah blah '' .
when you continue to stay on the line you have given your implied consent .
if you were on that same call after you hear that message you can explicitly tell them that you do n't consent to be recorded .
if you are operating in california you should always get the consent of all parties before recording any conversation that common sense tells you might be private '' or confidential . ''
in addition to subjecting you to criminal prosecution violating the california wiretapping law can expose you to a civil lawsuit for damages by an injured party .
the 1994 orange bowl between you guys and florida state was similar .
i do n't know that there was a full review of the play but the clock hit zero people rushed the field assuming the game was over and the referee ended up ruling that there was one second left allowing nebraska to try what would have been a game winning field goal .

it 's just that for the remaining like years the female body has to basically sacrifice itself for the sake of the future generation .

freddy does n't have a lot of build variety i can only think of 2 viable builds on him but he is extremely strong when applied correctly which is something other killers that are considered bad do n't have .
wraith and hag do n't have ways to be applied that can make them more powerful than other killers but freddy does .
nobody can lock down doors and get sudden 4ks at the end of the game like freddy can .
i will concede that his builds have to be extremely specific to be competitive but he does have redeeming values .

i 'm enjoying her myself just wish some people would chill with the overpraising .
i 'm not saying i 'm comfortable with the color the artist chose .
what i 'm saying is the artist has no obligation to bend his edits to the feelings of those who see it .
the people who are irked '' by it should simply downvote and move on .
this is not about my opinion i personally agree with you but the artist has no obligation to fit what i would prefer or what general people feel '' .
as someone who 's been discriminated because of my religious beliefs i agree that we should try and be aware of these issues but this is not something we can force onto someone who is simply making edits for their own enjoyement .
hcr was nerfed 450 auto rifles are now also slower ttk than most pulse rifles and apr helps damage against supered guardians .

as other 's mentioned it 's pretty hard to what you 're describing but you can try placing a high cut filter on most sounds at 15,000hz as anything above that can just sound hissy and harsh .
that and some glue compression where necessary should help mildly negate the quality problem .

has someone order an upside down caramel macchiato some other mods and then asked for it right-side up ... 🙄🙄🙄🙄😑😑😑😑
because the ptr patch did n't go live and last week 's patch notes are still active .
since we asked for detailed patch notes we get everything that is different between live and ptr even when previously mentioned
if this is true then i hope the actor is leaving the show on his own terms and not because of the circumstances that surround his character meant the writers could n't find anything for the character to do anymore so they just wrote him out halfway through the season .
it 's getting a dream job then you realize you can never leave or you 'll live in poverty like everybody else .
you know at some point you 'll have to quit but you spent all your money on drugs to get through each day .
or if that metaphor does n't work it 's like becoming a chef because you like to eat food .
maybe new year after people get the game from holiday .
perhaps they have rebranded as the store that sells ears that i have not been hearing about but have read about .
i think part of the problem is bully sounds like such a mild thing .
if someone is being driven to suicide it ai n't kids stuff .
i 've been on the shit end of this despised going to school .
i was ready to start stabbing people but did n't want to throw my life away on these fuckers .
the word is just too mild and cute the same way sexual harassment and intimidation can be made to sound mild with the right words .
i think the first step is jailing the school administrators who did nothing .
i do n't know how to keep the kids from becoming more of a target when steps are taken to protect them .
friend of mine finally got his tormenters to stop once he beat one of them bloody with his sax case .
another friend got it to stop after beating an attacker and knocking him down the stairs with broken bones .
this was in the 90 's so probably would have gotten them expelled today .
but the lesson was learned this kid is crazy go pick on someone easier .
it just kills me that this shit keeps happening and nobody is doing a damn thing .
it 's not like when we were kids because social media follows you home .
if you think it 's anything like what you grew up with then shut up you know nothing .
i originally read this as a me_irl type of thing where the kid asked for more people to beat them up .
i do n't know how i jumped to that conclusion .
none of the lights in my place are actually bulbs anymore but i 'm not going to get anywhere asking my spouse to put diodes on the shopping list .
i took my 3 year old to the optometrist and instead of letters the pediatric vision chart has symbols bird hand horse and rider jeep birthday cake but then one of the symbols is a rotary phone .
the last time i saw one was about ten years before the kid was born .
the us military does not condone the killing of innocents .
but this is n't real so why should you care ?
then we probably agree part of my assumption is that the guy/girl is n't going to settle but they 're not unrealistically picky either .
they would find a girlfriend/boyfriend who is decently attractive no major issues etc .
so it really gets back to the main point that any decently attractive woman can find a decently attractive boyfriend pretty easily if they really wanted and were n't unreasonably picky .
and certainly much easier than a decently attractive guy could .
i will start complaining once the air starts chapping my nostrils from the temperature conversation .
probably around 30 degrees f. but it 's actually stupid cold for me once it hits less than 0 f without windchill .
coldest i 've ever been was 40 f i think with wind but i 'm not sure .
anyway i could n't breathe and was getting light headed went to walk in to a building to warm up and catch my breath ... oh but wait it 's locked and under construction ... i 'll just sit on this railing out here for a while ... wow i 'm more tired than i thought ... i 'll just put my head down on my knees for a second .
did n't realize how stupid i was being until i saw people staring at me .
when i was in the military we did this all the time during long flights .
ahhh would have bought for 195 but is 220 now ...
a lot of attempted pen theft but i 'm vigilant .
i find it completely insane but i guess it works out often enough for the people who do it .
tab completion is part of virtually ever command line in existence today .
even the basic windows command line supports everything you mentioned as basic commands .
you can start with tab and it is n't case sensitive .
as for add-printer even the command itself is annoying to type .
what the hell is the dash doing in there ?
it might seem minor but it matters when you 're working .
ps loves to throw in dashes all over the place for no reason .
errors in ps are generally unhelpful and even bringing up the help for a command you do n't know is stupid .
there 's been a standard for years across platforms that if you use a command that requires arguments but you omit them it just shows the help .
with ps you get 7 lines of bullshit if you do it .
even windows command line let you call the help with ? .
every part of ps is slightly more annoying to use then every other shell i 've ever used .
it 's honestly just designed in a way to make it as annoying and long to use as possible while still getting the job done .

pixelbuds are way too expensive and the translation they showed is really cool but not barely even useful .
nathan robinson is not fond of d'souza 's argument that the left are the real nazis but is troubled the left is n't engaging with it or debating the point .
for a correction same like normal stock investments when media is talking about something all these lemmings jump on the train to get some profit .
after having the profit they cash out way to early .
always the same no matter if crypto or classic .
against a correction it 's a very unique system .
maybe maybe people see the advantage i doubt it though .
i think right now the rise is explainable because of the public interest in the currency .
how does the 3330 stack up against the 3310 and 3360 ?

masterworks sounds like a cd classic/rock series you 'll find in a super market at the check out register as a cheap sale to the gullible customer .
by level 20 i would have upgraded at least one weapon as high as possible yes you need to level beyond level 5 !
pick a weapon or two to focus on just for tier mode .
stop spreading your resources too thin as your weapons are underpowered for tier 20 and beyond .
i dont know how many resources it takes but someone has posted on here with the exact number use the search feature .
tier mode gives the enemies more health more damage and they can spot you way faster than normal extreme mode .
your time to aim and kill before being killed needs to be pretty much in a second with an upgraded weapon you will take them down in just a few shots and it is noticeable .
if you need an easy convoy technique use the desert hti and an emp drone and the rebel spotting perk .
spot the convoy mark your sync shot on the sicarios in the truck emp not always necessary if you do the next step quick enough take out the driver and passenger with sync shot and the whole convoy will stop hti the escort vehicles
this can be done extremely quickly and you avoid getting too close to the action the plus is your ai team can sync shot up to i think like 1km away so as long as you spot and mark the sync shot you can always chase after it .

my mum is a nurse and she worked for various doctors during her career .
they all instructed their teams to make sure patients with private insurance are getting an appointment asap while those with public insurance had to wait for weeks unless it was urgent .
some doctors hated it and were aware that it is unfair but since they were able to bill up to 3.5x of what they could bill for public insurance they were all more than willing to do so .

i used to run poison and the general strategy is poison with seismitoad and tentacool and depending on opposing figures you could either keep crobat on the field or use him to poison and cycle your figures .
you 're main beaters are swampert and blastoise but you may replace swampert with moltres if you want more mobility available at all times .
just position your beaters so they could deal with opposing figures after they get poisoned .
if you do replace swampert you may replace tentacool with another crobat if you have two .
with a crobat on field your blastoise is basically a 141 attacker against poisoned figure enough to deal with high-hitting figures .
you 'll have a bit of a problem against deo decks but they 're rare anyways and you could run tropical energy if you decide to use moltres and two crobat .
running mega blastoise could also help against deo decks as you could turtle missile deo a and deo s even if they switch to deo d. poison decks are usually defensive as you are running one slow figure in venusaur which usually stays on your goal so i do n't think it will be much different from your previous playstyle .
you 're basically splitting your runners from your beaters your beaters stay near your side to beat figures poisoned by your crobats and seismitoads .
come here to say i got this error as well .
thats usually caused by router firewalls that block specific ports that the xbox needs .

games i own/like or dislike i love scythe settlers of catan pax renaissance/profiriana i like terra mystica too little player interaction though and high frontier
i had in mind either terraforming mars looks awesome but is there enough player interaction or through the ages i know it takes forever .

at the beginning it was the only shield capable of sustaining rf then we got the leo mod and we could use that instead then that was nerfed so we were back to only using rise of the phoenix now that gets nerfed too ?
losing 3 max res is n't the biggest deal in the world but it 's more points spent on regen that wo n't be spent on life and therefore damage .

edit i 'm not arguing about balance changes i 'm just saying i do n't understand why it was changed .
tl dr i feel that liss is in a bad spot because she ends up being primarily viable as a burst mage but if she is strong enough to function as a burst mage effectively she is oppressive because of how safe her kit it so i have ideas to fix that
i want to keep this short so i do n't ramble the basic idea is i want to turn her into a control/sustained damage mage rather than this burst mage that she currently functions as .
i 'm looking for opinions mostly i am obviously no balance team member or riot employee in general .
overall flat damages reduced introduce percent health damage into her kit that scales very well but has low base so she is still incetivized to build ap
passive changed to spell hits apply a stacking slow up to 4 stacks x per stack to enemies lissandra does w/x/y/z scaling with ap percent max health damage to enemies on spell hit .
a 5th stack instead stuns the target for 1-2 seconds leaving them immune to liss passive for x seconds idk some balanced numbers
q slow passive with these changes should apply to all targets hit not just the first
w radius increase massively but rolls out in a slow wave similar to her current ult .
after casting its cd is reduced by x seconds stacking up to 4 times stacks last as long as her w 's base cd .
basically the idea is rev up time but can be spammed a lot once you get going .
r is now self cast only and instead of doing burst damage when it touches someone it does damage five times over its duration .
additionally targets hit by at least one hit of it are grounded for x the duration between hits .
think mei ult kinda for those that play overwatch .
edit to make the point more clearly in summary the point here is to stop talking about wmaf alone but in comparison to wmbf .
because it challenges this narrative that interracial marriage is this wonderful post-racial phenomenon where everyone gets to love everyone else .
if that 's the case why is wmbf so exceedingly rare and wmaf is everywhere ?
if interracial relationships were more evenly distributed then i can believe it but the stats are startlingly biased .
now most people will say yeah that 's true way more wmaf then amwf .
but that 's where i 'd say no that 's not the problem .
the problem is wmaf far outnumbers wmbf even though there are many more bf in america .
so this clear racial bias suggests white men are not living up to this post-racial ideal .
it 's racial preference at work not post-racial colorblindness .
i agree entirely with u/seb_paradise regarding the statistical normalcy of asian male outmarriage and the statistical outlier of asian female outmarriage .
so half the argument is there unexpectedly high asian female outmarriage is what 's worth studying not asian male outmarriage which is unremarkable .
but there is a further point to be made here black female outmarriage rates .
they are as aberrantly low as asian female numbers are high 12 vs 36 further refinement on this number is probably not even necessary the difference is that stark .
consider if we took the chart that u/seb_paradise linked and re-arranged it so that instead of breaking the numbers down by race we broke it down by gender
it becomes clearer the variation that really stands out is not as between am and af or really bm and bf .
i hinted at this in my article in plan a https planamag.com/about-that-natalie-tran-video-on-wmaf-4757fb293867 responding to tran 's video .
full disclosure as some of you have called me out for being sly about it i am listed as a special thanks in the video because i did consult with natalie on what the asian male online perspective was prior to this production
black women are also statistical outliers but in the other direction .
the relationship between unexpectedly high rates of outmarriage among asian women and the similarly low rate among black women is perhaps a more significant topic of discussion than the rates as between asian men and women .
this is because by re-orienting the graph by gender we can start to view this as a matter of white male preference as each female group marries out white in the most numbers or as female preference by race .
strong preference for wm by af versus strong preference for bm by bf and/or
strong preference for af by wm versus relative dislike of bf by wm
first it 's reasonable to think af preference for wm is much stronger than other xf preference for wm .
second it 's also reasonable to think that wm have a strong racial bias for af over bf .
i think social intuition would suggest both are at play here but which one is stronger is n't so clear .
the other is that am preferences and wf preferences are not really all that remarkable by comparison to the other side .
as i say in my article i really do n't think am are as relevant to the wmaf discussion as we believe .
this should not be about wmaf vs amwf there is no real reason to think that 's even an interesting empirical comparison .
it should be about wmaf vs wmbf and this is very rarely talked about .
it suggests that white male 'openness ' to interracial relationship shows a strong bias against black women and a strong preference for asian women .
am/wf dynamics really do n't factor that much here at all so let 's stop bringing up amwf everytime this topic comes up .
the following post by tcathcart15 is being replicated because the post has been silently greylisted for 0.4 hours .

so i started playing 3 weeks ago and feel i have done as much as i could on my own .
i have several gyms near where i live that i visit almost on a daily basis and it would be awesome to have a group to do a lot of this with .
hit me up if you 're interested have any question or are available .
i 'm a daily player of your fifa mobile game .
while i 'm not one of those weirdos probably with stolen credit card numbers who throw you thousands of dollars to play your glitchy little cell phone game i ante up .
here and there i 'll drop five or ten and a few times even twenty dollars .
it 's how you change the rules to this game .
i fire up the app and whoa everything 's changed .
what i was supposed to do yesterday to advance in the game i can no longer do .
what was a worthwhile endeavor yesterday is now worthless .
you roll things out see how they look and then change them never with advance notice .
i 've handed over this money to advance according to the rules of the game as they 've been presented .
and then after you 've taken my cash from me – i 've noticed there 's never ever a glitch when it comes to collecting my money you go and change the rules .
as i see it that violates the contract we 've entered into together .
i did n't pay for this i paid for that over there for yesterday 's game .
so as you 've yet again arbitrarily changed the game it seems only fair that you reimburse me in full for every dollar i 've handed to you before today .
i 'm sure you have a complete record of my expenditures .
if you do n't i 've kept my receipts and will gladly share them with you .
which is refund everyone you 've baited and switched .
i 'd like to get the tank off my xvs650 repaired it has a shallow ding the size of a golf ball .
i 've looked up some shops online that will let me mail the tank for a repair and there seems to be only a few .
were you satisfied with the repair or do you wish you would 've gone a different route ?
i signed a non-disclosure/non-compete agreement with a corporate chain in florida that i only ended up working for for less than two weeks .
i quit the job and would like to return to my prior job but i am worried the company might come after me for the nda/nca agreement which says i can not work within twenty miles of their establishment for a full year my prior establishment is about 5 miles away .
how likely is it that the company will actually come for me ?
i called the hr team to ask about the non-disclosure and they said they never go after any employee that leaves the company but is it possibly they are lying ?
i am really concerned about this because i am broke and i have no legal issues in my past and would prefer not to have any at all .
thanks for reading and i appreciate the feedback ! !
like this one for example they are discussing tara mccarthy in this article but what the fuck does lauren southern have to do with this ?
title says it all just dont have the option to use the one i bought last season but i can select it on all my other ops .
anyone have a solve or know whats going on ?
i was in champ select when y client just froze and i dodged a game for it .
when i tried relogging it just got stuck on authenticating .
i tried the hextech repair thing repair in the client itself and reinstalling the client .
the season pass costs 35 usd and it comes with 2 dlcs .
this makes it so that if you bought the season pass the curse of osiris dlc coo is worth 17.5 usd .
considering that the full game costs 60 usd the new dlc costs roughly 29 of destiny 2 's price at launch 17.5÷60 .
so that 's our magic number 29 roughly a third of the full game 's price .
considering this at the very least we should be expecting content that is at least a third of the size of the content found in the full game .
destiny 2 's story is roughly 12-15 hours long .
if you 're on ps4 the test is passed !
on xbox and pc 2 news maps are added to your stable of 11 .
you 're only paying 29 so instead of a new raid you get new encounters for the leviathan raid !
the new loot are either reskins or rerolls of vanilla d2 loot .
there are a couple of new exotics some of which are just d1 exotics .
fuck most of the new content is sold through the eververse !

as a female player i 've spent the last 13 years avoiding all voice chat programs with other players i do n't know .
i play a tank in game and revel in the fact that most people assume i am a male player .
that being said i am excited for voice chat because my time is mostly spent pugging mythics and this will help me coordinate with the other players .
i currently have a cheap synthetic messenger/laptop bag which has always looked its price and starting to get holes in the base .
i have nothing good to say about the style .
however it has some positives that i 'd like to replicate to a greater or lesser extent
most good bags seem to have flaps which i find annoying and fiddly .
just big enough for a 15 '' macbook pro comfortable fit for a 13 '' laptop and a4 papers approx 34x32x8cm without flexing the material outwards .
the material easily compresses when the bag is not full making it feel much slimmer than it 's maximum capacity .
there is enough give to make a bit of extra space though .
i normally carry headphones/chargers and some bits and pieces at the expense of a small bulge .
i can throw in a thick magazine book and hardshell sunglasses case if i push it .
i 'd prefer leather because it 's smarter but i get the impression canvas is most likely to hit these preferences especially 2 and 3 .
the navali looks really close to what i want but has the top flap .
despite saying 13 '' laptops in the description i believe it 's larger than what i have and would fit a 15 '' .
i think it is also no longer available in navy .
this will be my first attempt at it and i 'm fairly certain i 'll be able to knock it out despite two days of travel .
planning on ripping a nice 92mi ride on christmas eve just to ring it in .
i have seen so many successful 100k subscriber channels that have no channel tags whatsoever .
then you have someone like kyutie that changes her channel tags everytime she releases a new video .
she sets her channel tags to match those of the new video .
so my question is as it stands currently how relevant still are channel tags ?
and why change the tags to match every new video you make ?
does n't it take like a few weeks for youtube to re-index changes you make to your channel description and tags ?
as an afterthought i see so many people release videos where there is also almost nothing in the description field .
just repeating the video title and then asking folks to subscribe .
or the entire description field consists of links to their other videos .
yet the videos go on to rake in the views .
this goes against the youtube 101 teachings of create a detailed relevant description containing your keywords '' etc etc .

no i ca n't ask my neighbours because they are leaving before me convenient i know .
their customer service was great as the agent offered help and was nice but it did n't really fix the issue .

recently every time i have tried to boot up and play solo r6 half the time it 's simply unable to find me a match .
sometimes the queue lasts indefinitely as a solo upwards of 15 minutes even during high populated servers .
furthermore when i attempt to queue up with friends i find that r6 randomly kicks me out of queue for no warning or reason whilst they continue on into game .
i even contacted ubisoft via support ticket and they have n't gotten back to me .
conducted all of ubisofts ' connectivity fixes and no dice .
all anyone knows is that it is an issue and there is no current fix .
anyone know what i 'm dealing with and has fixed it ?

i 've read some blogs where assistants talk about not really having many people around and not having any public transportation available .
i 'd really like to end up somewhere where i 'll be able to meet other people around my age or be able to hang out with other teaching assistants and of course it would be great to be able to use transportation to get around visit other places in europe etc .
some people have mentioned some schools providing housing for teaching assistants ?
does that mean you 'd end up living with other assistants around ?
i 'd love to have a roommate that is either another teaching assistant or a student etc .
i would love to go somewhere that gets a bit colder and i do n't mind rainy or dark weather .
or suggestions for websites to learn more about the different regions ?
i was thinking perhaps lille would be my first choice ?
i picked up a moto x4 a little under a week ago and tossed in an old 32gb sandisk card without any issues .
once my 128gb samsung card arrived in the mail i tossed it in with nothing but problems .
android is telling its corrupt and wants me to erase format .
when i hit the button it starts at 20 and after a few seconds at 20 takes me to a screen that says the card is ready .
once i hit done it still shows it as corrupt .
i tried formatting it in my computer but nothing seems to work .
i have gotten a replacement through amazon and the new card acts the same way as the last one .
it includes the new shipments guild and guild event shops .
it 's not complete yet so please feel free to let me know of any updates or changes .

like it seriously sucks that martin stein is dead and now jefferson will be mia for a while .
i know we have constantine coming to legends of tomorrow but i bet he will only stay for two or three episodes .
however will citizen cold be staying a the series regular again ?
he was also my favourite character when i started watching this show .
shipping will be based of location but expect 3 6 .
does anyone else have a sunken gut feeling recently ?
i 've held eth for over a year but suddenly feel sick to my stomach about it and am considering partially getting out .
i think it 's amazing it is a real popular application that uses blockchain tech that is n't illegal or shady or on a roadmap 5 years away .
congestion for real world use is a great problem to have .
global consistency is inherently difficult to scale if every node has to compute a state transition function then adding more machines does n't necessarily make the network faster .
cryptokitties would be a great application on a plasma sidechain and i hope i 'll be involved enough in the community over the next couple years to be involved in the development and use of the new scaling technologies coming from ethereum .
this is about my dry cleaner talking about crypto particularly bitcoin i ask about it they can hardly describe what it even is .
people are putting money into a currency they can not even describe one that has a median transfer price of 6 and over 100k as of earlier today pending transactions in the mempool .
btc futures are coming soon which will allow for institutional shorting .
this seems like a catalyst that will drive a major bubble pop minimally a correction and if it does n't one has to ask why are people putting money in a medium that can not function as well as the current financial system and has no roadmap to actually get there with no real new application ?
valve 's decision to stop accepting btc is writing on the wall .
i do n't think this 'll ruin crypto but many of you are in a similar situation as i am you saw a 50-80x unrealized return on investment .
you can not time the market but you can look at catalysts correlations btc/eth pricing are historically heavily correlated and consider time value of money .
i 'm consider selling around 50 of my position to reinvest at a later time .
some polite discussion on where we agree and disagree would be really useful .
this is the best tl dr i could make original http www.embernewsline.com/2017/12/bitcoin-smashes-14000-in-latest-record.html reduced by 36 .
bitcoin kicked off wednesday with a big rally that propelled its course to over 12,000 and then it really started in a breathtaking 18-hour run which went to 13,275 late in the afternoon .
the recent craze for a bubble ready for the bubble seems to be fueled by recent interest in south korean speculators and the news that bitcoin derivatives will be sold in the us next week .
wednesday 039 s race also shows that 1,000 worth of bitcoin which lasted weeks or months now occurs in days or hours .
today 039 s jump recalls how bitcoin climbed from 10,000 to 11,000 in about 12 hours on november 29th .
not everyone is convinced that the benefit of bitcoin will continue .
the new voices pouring cold water on bitcoin came from scandinavia where the ceo of nordea bank ab described it as a quot joke quot while the head of the largest danish pension fund said the motto was quot something we did quot .
the next big test of bitcoin is likely to take place next week as currency futures begin in the us next week .

vou fazer a minha primeira semana que vem to com aquela ansiedade e um pouco de medo de me arrepender daqui alguns anos mesmo sendo pequena e eu gostar muito do desenho .
i made a quick informative 8 minute animated video explaining society 's conditioning and how it affects you getting laid https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=y0cjtba01_o
how poorly ben handled the situation with ryan and chrissy after voting out joe
lauren telling ben she found the first half of the idol
mike telling ashley everything ben told him when they could have just taken out lauren with her idol and extra vote without all the chaos somehow this all worked out perfectly for dr. mike but the process was terrible
ashley basically telling ben they were voting for him at tribal
honorable mention ashley lauren and devon initially targeting ben when they had the 4-3 majority .
the only reason this is defensible is because lauren had the extra vote so they still would have had the numbers against ryan chrissy and mike .
• i wrote this in another thread but i 'll post it again here .
people are always going to remember her giving mike the idol but not playing her extra vote was almost as bad .
she should have been worried about two things — mike chrissy and ryan voting for her and ben having an idol .
if she was confident ben did n't have an idol she should have voted an extra time for ben .
if she thought maybe he could have an idol she should have used the extra vote on someone else .
if she had used that extra vote on devon he probably goes home on the re-vote .
obviously it 's hard to think that fast at tribal council but she could have saved herself even without the idol .
• that tribal unintentionally worked out perfect for mike chrissy and ryan .
despite being in the minority they were somehow able to flush two idols and an extra vote with lauren one of the biggest threats in the game going out .
• would you say anyone has played a great game ?
mike is all over the place ben did n't handle the aftermath of the joe vote well and was a jerk to cole and chrissy has been terrible socially to people not in her alliance .
i 'd say devon ashley and ryan have n't made any glaring mistakes .
i know people will say ryan should n't have told ben about his idol but chrissy and jp already knew about it so chances were ben would find out about it sooner or later .
• from a gameplay standpoint i think my two biggest takeaways this season are this 1 .
find idols and advantages at all costs and do n't tell anybody about them .
nobody can just sit on their hands anymore and make the easy vote these days .
the easy thing would have been to take out ryan or chrissy but ashley wanted to pad her resume and make a big move against ben .
ben is the obvious target next week but i doubt he 'll go home because he 's too easy of a vote .
this is what makes the big moves era of survivor so fun and maddening at the same time .
anyone else thinking of making a build with this gem and maybe desecrate or unearth totems to supply corpses ?

add me for a good chat and fun times !
i know from reading older posts here that the distro shouldn't have an impact on the games you 're able to run .
but as of late i 've been having trouble with a few games .
i chose mint because i thought it would have the exact same compatibility as ubuntu but i 've had game maker and rpg maker games not work for me .
those are supposed to support only ubuntu lts 14 but of course they do tend to work .
some steam games do n't work either with gone home having a bug that makes it unplayable and party hard and sanctum 2 simply do n't boot .
now i used to boot into my windows partition once in a full moon but now it feels a bit depressing to be using it regularly for sanctum 2 gone home ... when those are supposed to be linux games .
would switching to ubuntu give me better odds for compatibility ?
i converted to mint 18.0 last year and i 'm very very happy overall .
when i tried both cinnamon felt more noob-friendly than unity but at this point i just want to plug and play .
maybe i should n't have dropped game names because i was just looking for an answer like bobbywya 's ie linux mint mainline edition is just ubuntu .
i was wondering if libraries or dependencies or drivers could vary slightly between ubuntu and mint but i guess the answer is no then ?
i 've played more than a hundred games last year on linux and except the ones i mentioned they all worked flawlessly including those that make heavy use of the nvidia proprietary driver .
since most of the games that give me trouble are made with gamemaker and rpgmaker slight differences between ubuntu and mint would explain most of my troubles .

yes baby i only love you i only tell him i do n't so he does n't feel bad silly .
baby look see he 's cumming on my pussy but he has n't even touch it well yes it did brush up for a moment but not really .
i know i fingered my ass until i came after he blew his load on my face but i only did it so that he thought it was n't only for him .

how are you going to drop bb8 on us with a day 's notice and not offer packs for first order toons ?
fost is arguably a way more brutal grind than the vets .

i run a small animation studio and we 've noticed that our older 6850k based 3 980ti server has been putting up some abnormally high temperatures .
we currently have 3 980ti reference cooler based cards along with a spare unused 980ti that is missing it 's cooler we messed around with several aio solutions before taking the plunge into a full loop system .
i just pulled the plug on ordering 4 swiftech komodo-nv full coverage waterblocks and am looking for recommendations on a pump radiator and piping solution as well as cases we love the phanteks enthoo pro-but if there is a better solution out there we would love to jump on it .
i currently have the cpu running into a corsair hydro series h115i so the watercooling loop will be dedicated to these cards .
would love to see if i can get a nice overclock using this solution in octane render !
i 've written ai for my games before but they either had one behavior or had a linear progression of behaviors .
when i think of an fps ai i think of a state tree but i have no idea how to start writing one .
as a general rule civs with strong water bonuses viking saracens port etc typically dont have shipwright because of balance .
but then they give shipwright to italians and malay who already are the best water civs in the game .
now water battles typically dont go late-imperial but when it happens its kinda annoying that you cant fight these civs at any stage of the game .
i 've been reading a lot recently about economic disparity and also race relations in the us but was interested in a change of pace .
i was looking for books on american imperialism specifically but i 'm open to any books on this topic from european colonialism in the 15th to 19th century to imperialism in the 20th century .
it 's been a while since i had a lot of free time to read so i 'm not sure where to look .
if anyone has any suggestions for books on these topics or anywhere i can find recommendations for good historical or political nonfiction books i would even take some well written historical fiction too i would really appreciate it !
taking a cpr lesson in city greenville is very important as one is exposed to the different concept which equips one the knowledge ought to be garnered in dealing with cardiac arrest incidents .
in the few years individuals have taken into consideration the importance of a acquiring a cpr certification that is not only essential for medical technicians but also them considering cardiac arrests are bound to happen anywhere and anytime .
one maybe curious on different issues such as the preparation needed before the class the duration and what will be done before the class and during the cpr classes greenville sc http ift.tt/2zkae8z but to the surprise of many the course is very short and only requires ones dedication focus and commitment .
in this cpr courses expect the following a manual which has a step by step process illustrating steps taken in the cpr procedure .
these manuals are handed to each and every trainee by the instructor whereby he or she gives a walk-through of the manual in detail discussing each and every section .
as i had mentioned earlier additional knowledge never hurts therefore getting to add more information on what you already know is very important more so information that might help in future.cpr certification grants an opportunity to work at diverse places such as schools hospitals and companies .
as stated earlier every minute in cardiac arrest cases counts therefore before a medical pr actioner arrives in such an incident the victim will have already lost his or her life .
it is therefore important that people be trained on the cpr procedure so as to avoid loss of lives and ensure that people are not caught off-guard .
taking up such a course can enable one to be confident and ready for anything anywhere .
such incidents are bound to happen and if they happen and you administer cpr thus saving a life can render one a golden opportunity of becoming a hero and even exposing one to larger platforms .
cpr training is also a part of organizational health and safety policy that involves the training of workers on cpr so as to ensure chances of survival for workers who have heart related emergencies .
a question that revolves around the mind of many is what really causes a heart problem .
ventricular fibrillation is one major causes of heart complications which is as an abnormal heart rhythm whereby the heart stops pumping and fibrillates instead .
the abnormal heart rhythm can result due to several heart problems which include electrocution resulting into a heart attack cardiomyopathy which is as a result of using hard drugs heart valve disease which is the inflammation of the heart muscle and also lack of sufficient oxygen in the body as a result of choking .
conclusively individuals interested in taking up the cpr short courses in greenville sc should use the opportunity given by the state county of greenville to ensure that they enroll in these classes to enable them gain experience and be knowledgeable in this sector so as to save lives in the state county .
it is important that the people appreciate what has been instituted by the county as instructors or trainers are also provided to take them through the course .
when you are searching for information about cpr classes greenville sc http ift.tt/2zkae8z residents can come to our web pages online today .

i 'm not expecting it to be perfectly balanced at the meta-level .
but as far as visuals soundtrack controls extras characters and variety go this game hits above and beyond .
it 's the perfect example of what a fighting game should be and sets a high standard as a game of its generation .
i feel the same way for the original soulcalibur despite being less popular .
but playing sc2 hd on ps3 recently revealed to me again just how great this game was .

this is the best tl dr i could make original https www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/navalny-army-russians-risking-all-to-oppose-vladimir-putin reduced by 86 .
all of this appears to be linked to pakhomova 039 s job she is the regional coordinator for the presidential campaign of alexei navalny an opposition politician who wants to challenge vladimir putin for the russian presidency in elections next march .
navalny will most likely be barred from standing due to a criminal conviction in a case that was widely seen as politically motivated but the 41-year-old anti-corruption campaigner is ignoring this .
navalny 039 s supporters are mainly young russians who have known little in their lifetimes except a putin presidency .
in kemerovo pakhomova 039 s team is looking to move office after its landlord said the local administration called him and warned him not to rent to the navalny campaign .
in kemerovo many people have still not heard of navalny and among those who have views are mixed .
there are signs that navalny 039 s message could potentially resonate among a new audience in a country where up to now putin has managed to remain above widespread anger at corruption .

even post valk and res nerf and moira addition .
i feel like she should always be a must pick in the highest levels of overwatch considering she 's what most people would say a low skill floor '' hero myself included .
i 've seen people talking about maybe a longer cd for self-heal to kick in and shorter valk .
anyway thoughts on how to fix '' or nerf her ?

as i understand the whitepaper and the faq gno tokens are held in escrow for a contracted time and then returned to the holder once the contracted period expires .
while they are held in escrow they are used to generate wiz that can be used to pay fees and participate in prediction markets .
what is unclear to me is how the fee taker earns actual revenue from a gno token since the generated wiz are generated for free by the platform apparently perpetually if the gno token is perpetually placed under contract .
are wiz themselves freely tradable independently of the gno-locking smart contract ?

request network has been dubbed paypal 2.0 by some commentators and while request can work as a payment platform akin to paypal many do not realise that the request network is much more .
request is not an app but a financial platform on which many projects can be developed .
... we want to structure cryptocurrency payments finance and accounting areas .
our goal is to build a platform to operate payment requests applicable for every financial flow and structure it by allowing external systems and software to plug into the platform through the use of our apis. – request team – november 24 update https blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-24th-2017-tech-ecosystem-request-core-kyber-network-b760637eba9b .
the request network envisions itself as a financial platform a protocol agnostic financial layer on top of blockchain technology .
request 's financial platform focuses on providing the infrastructure that will become the standard for invoices accounting auditing and payments in cryptocurrencies and fiat assets. request team – november 24 update https blog.request.network/request-network-project-update-november-24th-2017-tech-ecosystem-request-core-kyber-network-b760637eba9b .
request plans to deliver on this vision by leveraging blockchain technologies e.g .
kyber partnership http spec-rationality.com/request-network 29nov which we covered previously and ensuring that they remain platform and currency agnostic so as to reach the widest possible audience .
for this we need to take a look at the tech mind map https www.mindmeister.com/991002501 ? t=r1iofdilv0 that the team released with their november 24 update .
the request mind map is split into branches of which the below 3 are key to actualise their platform .
philosophy and vision – the team aims to base their work and decisions in their stated core philosophies .
protocol – the core protocol functions of the network core request protocol multi-currency cross chain verification and fiat extensions for developers escrow down payments etc .
financial flows mechanism cross-currency settlement kyber partnership fees reputation and privacy scaling .
use cases – the use cases can be thought of as implementations that leverage the core protocol functions to provide and facilitate services .
some of the use cases include standard requests online payments accounting financial audit p2p and point of sale .
many of the endpoints on request 's tech mind map are ambitious projects in themselves .
the realisation of protocol endpoints seem to add greater functionality to request network infrastructure while use case endpoints are the user facing implementations that grow the request ecosystem .
this is where request 's strength could really shine in its ability to build a diverse and robust financial platform that provides the tools and infrastructure for devs to deploy the financial applications and services they envision or to integrate request with existing applications .
lets take a look at the impact that request network could have on just one of its major use cases accounting .
request could revolutionise accounting by allowing users to settle transactions over the request network .
double entry accounting – gives bookkeepers faith in their own books but external auditing is required to gain the confidence of third parties .
the current financial industry is underpinned by double entry accounting .
double entry accounting is a system in which each entry into a ledger has an equal and opposite entry in a different account in other words each debit has a corresponding credit .
where the debits in a ledger do not equal credits we know that there has been some error or fraud .
double entry accounting revolutionised financial accounting as it gave book-keepers confidence in the contents of their own books .
however to gain the confidence of third parties the work of external auditors is still necessary .
triple entry accounting via blockchain technology – all accounting entries involving outside parties are cryptographically verified by a third entry on a common ledger .
dramatically reducing the need for external audit but difficult to implement in the absence of accepted norms or standards for the third entry .
blockchain brings with it the advent of triple entry accounting transactions between disparate parties can be recorded in an immutable manner on a distributed common ledger dramatically reducing the role of external audit which may still be needed for internal controls .
the transaction details are agreed by both parties and cryptographically stored on the blockchain so now third parties shareholders investors etc .
should be able to verify accounts just by checking entries in a private ledger for consistency with the corresponding third entry on a distributed ledger .
however there is no standardised or uniform infrastructure that disparate companies/individuals can utilise for their immutable third entry records .
while two parties could certainly store their transaction details on existing blockchain infrastructure using bespoke methodology which will likely be an additional manual step after the transaction takes place the lack of common standards across industry would still make it difficult for outside parties to verify the third entry records with any ease .
request network – a protocol agnostic financial layer designed to convert a theoretically infinite range of transactions into immutable accounting records that are easy to verify because they use a standardised infrastructure .
request creates a standardised infrastructure that disparate parties can utilise not only to settle transactions but to simultaneously create immutable accounting records in the form of a receipt or third entry that is stored on a distributed ledger .
the transaction automatically creates the third entry there is no manual entry step furthermore this third entry remains easy to verify because it utilises a predictable set of standards .
not only does the request layer enable currency agnostic transactions at lower cost than centralised iterations it could conceivably revolutionise the accounting process in that very same step .
thanks to the interoperability immutability and decentralized nature of the blockchain we 'll see the emergence of the triple-entry accounting system the invoice becomes the transaction and the time stamping system basic blockchain function that permanently registers on the block the time that a particular action took place . – excerpt from request yellow paper https request.network/assets/pdf/request_yellowpaper_smart_audits.pdf .
we 've looked at just one aspect of what the request platform can do and yet the breadth of the project starts to become evident .
by creating the infrastructure and backend needed for individuals and companies to implement triple entry accounting just one of its use cases request opens up the possibility of migrating towards a fully smart audit .
the request network intends to tackle all aspects of a smart audit by achieving simplicity automation immutability common database accuracy authenticity a decrease in human errors traceability of invoices and payments reconciliation a triple-entry system .
from turnover to wages and taxes a financial audit will go through all the transactions of a company .
we categorize an audit today into several sections equity assets banks customers income suppliers charges salaries taxes intercompanies financial charges and income. – excerpt from request yellow paper https request.network/assets/pdf/request_yellowpaper_smart_audits.pdf .
this is by no means an easy task if we take a step outside crypto for a second and look at the behemoth that is the financial accounting industry it is easy to see that an overhaul of accounting processes will be an uphill battle .
we should not underestimate the power and monopoly that existing accounting philosophies enterprise software companies and regulators have .
changing the established way of doing things will need to be a grassroots effort development of new applications plugins to existing applications etc .
underpinned by a solid working product and realised eventually through mass adoption .
with the financial accounting industry becoming more aware of blockchain technology and how it can benefit from triple entry accounting real time accounting source https www.insidesap.com.au/need-care-blockchain-now-not-later request is in a prime position to be one of the leaders in the field .
like all disrupters request will face many challenges but with a solid team and platform the request network is giving itself a great shot at success .
people that wait and then realize there is no dip happening suddenly invest lots of money while newcomers join and decide to wait but the cycle just repeats .
if you love the idea of me taking control and absolutely craving for every drop of my seed this is for you .
i want you to crave to have my babies and beg me to knock you up and fill you full to the brim with my seed .
not just once but over and over and over again load after load you cant get enough of it that is if you can handle it
here 's where we start we meet at a party exchanging looks after locking eyes and instantly feeling the primal instinct to jump on each other .
i 'll save the details to keep some mystery but our first session is after the party .
i love the idea of starting with a condom but hearing that you cant take it anymore and need to feel me properly begging to take it off .
from there it 'd get pretty wild and lead to you wanting my babies begging for me to breed you and knock you up .
i wouldnt be able to stop after just once i would keep going one after the other after the other .
i also like the idea of me being hesitant to finish inside but you forcing me to stay inside pulling me in .
another idea is right after our wedding still in your wedding dress needing it so bad that theres no time to undress fully .
i dont want to give away too much the mystery and fun is waiting
if you love the idea of this and think you can handle it pm me .
i can not forecast what will be the top price for emc2 .
hey guys i have this site with lots of content it 's designed as a summary page that link to lots of articles in the same site everything made with wordpress .
i managed to put it on analytics adsense and google search console .
i added a neat sitemap and registered it on the search console a few months ago .
the problem is that google is not automatically indexing the newer pages .
the only times it seem to work are if i manually go to search as google '' and even that takes a few days to show up on the searches .
also i noticed that even spot on searches wo n't find my articles right away and often they 're behind many sites that have nothing to do with the search parameters .
i registered all my domains in the search console with and without https and www .
i added sitemap.xml and sitemap.html in the search console both work normally when i access them .
my site is about law/jurisprudence so surely not among the generic type of site .
barely any portals makes me have to travel long distances either via airship or flying or walking .
makes me feel like the world is way bigger and immersive

from powering on my phone it has a small amount of blue tint really not bad as how the media makes it out to be no grains in screen speakers work well no chips or random reboots .
i really love this phone i also have a note 8 and the vibrancy from this phone is pretty decent .
if anyone stiff have doubt please go to a store to check out the phone in person you will love it .
the manufacturer date is november 13 when i got the phone also it was running september security patch but even before the update screen was still fine just a little washed out .
i do n't really hate the leafs i just fucking hate kadri with a blind fury .
ignoring the fans and the shit they pull i actually like a lot of their players .
rielly martin marner jvr bozak zaitsev gardiner all seem like good players and ok people at least i do n't remember anything super shitty off the top of my head but kadri is a little rat faced piece of shit wannabe marchand asshole .
this is the clip that reminded me how much i hate that little cowardly ass snake .

can you please tell me how you handle this at your home/office ?
as title i have no idea what model of brand the screen in my t420 is but the viewing angles are dreadful and the colour quality is extremely lacking .
this could be because i 've gone from a mbp retina screen or because it generally sucks on this model .
i know people have swapped it out as my research has shown however im a little nervous on moving forward .
if i opt for a change what model can i use ?
which model if you have changed yours do you use and could recommend ?
i 'm looking to buy a broken or for parts acer e15 e5 574g to fix mine .

go lethality if you want to dive their carry you can also split push side lanes and try to catch a carry .
if they have a good peeling comp they have a good positioning or you are too behind build some deffensive stats like bc ga tabi and try to peel your carry if he 's not behind .

i transferred schools recently and had to basically start all over and no one really goes out of their way in college to make friends .
all of my friends are work/class-only friends and it 's so awkward trying to get past that .

you may want to look into my scenario it includes rso with it and might do what you want in terms of spawning different forces .
do you want true pvp like versus or just want people to spawn on different friendly teams with different research ?

this is all about theresa may conflating the two things brexit and the echr to try and achieve the conservatives wet dream of a police state and trash the universal declaration of human rights .
the echr has nothing to do with the eu yet the tory government decided we should leave it as part of leaving the eu .
presumably the rest of britain swallowed this bullshit because the name of the organisation has european '' in it and therefore must be bad .
this whole thing has been about manipulating an under-informed electorate and it pisses me off !
we the uk helped set-up the echr after world war 2 and here we are trying to exit a court which has seen fundamental human rights guaranteed in europe for 50 years without any idea of what replaces i again i assume nothing replaces it so we will no longer have human rights in the uk .

yes as long as it is n't affecting gameplay in anyway .

the same people that were supporting obama when he said ... what does trump have a magic wand ?
are the same ones claiming trump inherited obama 's economy hypocrisy at it 's finest .
the difference between the third person and the first person italicized text is that the italicized first person text is direct character thought while the rest is the narrative somewhat removed from the character .
an author can pull out and zoom in at will for different effects .
the first person italicized thoughts are way zoomed in with a tight focus on the character 's inner thoughts without any intrusion from the narrator who 's removed from the character .
now a tight narrative focus does n't necessarily have to be in first person or italicized .
the major difference is in the level of how much the character 's actual perceptions and way of speech and thought filters through the narrative .
a tight focus is purely the character while a pulled out focus would be mainly the narrator telling you how the character feels etc .
in fact the author can pull out so far as to make their be no viewpoint at all which i do not recommend unless you know what you 're doing .
a really good book that covers narrative distance is orson scott card 's characters and viewpoint .
i highly suggest you read it if you 'd like to understand this stuff more .
narrative distance and viewpoint were one of the hardest things for me to get a good grasp of .

my true inseam as measured from absolute top of leg/where meets crotch to bottom of ankle is 30.5 inches and my de0305s are 33.5 .
fwiw my personal preference would prob be 2 inches longer so that i could cuff the same amount but have the cuff sit a tad higher on the boots .
if ever the hardcore eu countries want to let them give up sovereignty .
a combined franco-german state with perhaps benelux joining would be very powerful and influential and would dwarf the uk .
just think whilst in the eu we had the power to push for a broad and shallow eu which we did hence the expansion it prioritised over deepening of relationships .
personally i think a fine would be appropriate but knowing his past tkachuk is definitely getting at least one game .
europe is seeing those kinds of numbers without a settlement .

ok i see what you 're driving at now .
i think think you 're correct to acknowledge the clear bias in this sub and i agree with you generally about holding mp 's to a high standard .
i personally do n't think that golriz is behind her bio on the greens website and her earlier and subsequent disclosures if that 's an appropriate term for acting as a defence lawyer back this up .
even she was i do n't see any moral difference between acting for a defendant as opposed to the prosecution in a criminal matter irrespective of what the case is about .
i do n't think you 're point about holding mp 's to a higher standard is relevant specifically on the basis that i do n't see much wrong from the greens in this case and nothing wrong from golriz .
the standard i think you 're wanting to hold her too is set too high to be reasonable even for an mp .
the trouble here is i think the emotive context of the rwandan genocide which has amplified the issue beyond its due and given people with agendas the chance to throw sand about and i 'm not referring to you i 'm thinking farrar etc .
he might not be held to the same standard 's of behaviour as a non mp but he is still subject to the laws of new zealand .
i think golriz would be be right to bring a defamation case against him .
perhaps she could donate any damages to causes associated with refugees or something although that would be her business .

ca n't wait for you to see the movie and realize this is all in it .
i 'm guessing there will be some post tournament episodes as well plus u7 vs u11 will be a few episodes .
first off the solution really depends on how the data is being stored sql is great when dealing with entire lists of things but because of the nature of tabular data table joins will murder performance .
if the data is stored in a graph this would be a straight forward graph search at two nodes .
if you are only looking at 1 edge bfs and dfs are pretty much the same .
knowing fb you may need to deal with cases where the data are on different servers or ca n't fit it memory stuff like that .
my go-to in those situations are bloom filters data structures that are fast and relatively little memory usage to figure out is someone could be a mutual friend .
guaranteed to avoid false negatives but have a certain probability of false positives .
i 'd definitely try to know about bloom filters tries and splay trees .
they are data structures that are n't used a whole lot but talking through pros and cons about methods is what they are looking for .
part of that is asking them to specify the problem background info and tailoring your answer to that .
if i told you the friends are stored in a graph data structure and you start talking sql table joins i 'd probably fail you on the spot .
are there other processes that could edit the records at the same time ?
do we have to connect to multiple servers to grab data ?
the answer to those questions should change your answer maybe memory is n't a huge deal maybe grabbing a couple mutual friends at a time works .

i 'm starting williams he started the season and got hurt .
so i expect a share of carries but williams will get the most .
he 's long can guard 1-3 is fast and can handle the ball .
he 's good at getting to the rim as well which fits right in with quin 's system .
the only question i have is whether or not he 'll end up being a good enough shooter .
he was looking good over summer league and preseason but you just never know until he does it in season .
i 'm looking forward to years of them playing together .
edit also he can guard the bigger player while mitchell takes the pg 's he is very young for how long he 's been in the league and he should be relatively cheap for a player with such a high ceiling .
the jazz would be crazy not to invest more in him .
not schizophrenia i 'm above the maximum onset age .
and yes i have been diagnosed with several neurological conditions as mentioned in the original post .
the methods used to diagnose me with adult adhd periodic limb movement disorder and anxiety would have reveled more serious conditions .
if you knew me in real life you would never believe i was telling you this .

hs talent in wisconsin is underrated in a couple aspects .
while football is big here it 's not quite like in the south .
much more common to see kids still playing multiple sports and the s c is n't quite as intense .
in addition since it is fairly rural and not a big recruiting bed players here just do n't get as much attention for simple logistical reasons .
so you have talent but it 's not as well developed and a bit overlooked .
wisconsin 's blueprint under alvarez is to focus a ton of recruiting effort on the state to make sure we get everyone we want and the walk on program is a huge part of that the walk ons are treated the same and tons of them are successful .
we also then do a very serious s c program and typically linemen would not start until they are rs jr or sr .
this further deflates our recruiting rankings because our classes are smaller due to all the redshirts .
then just go get the best guys you can at the skill positions from across the country and have really good coaching overall .
it works because we 've had great coaches and the state does produce a ton of good linemen and linebackers and stuff .
anderson screwed this up and we also had a weird rash of catastrophic injuries to our ol so we are still recovering from this we started a freshmen 2 sophs and 2 juniors on the line this year .
however chryst is bizarrely a great recruiter and we are pulling in really good talent at skill positions for the first time .
i wonder how well they could be used for a swrpg campaign specifically an aor one where you have to defend bases or go on attack runs .
i did always want to do one of those type scenarios .
as for money i waited until some sales and got all mine that way .
i am sorry that was your experience but i would n't dissuade others from seeking out bio parents .
my mom was similarly messed up and it did n't go well as was my dad but i got some answers and my dads family out of it so it was well worth it .
i totally agree with you about r/loseit the support i get on here is totally different .
brink was a great concept but it had a terrible execution .
i happened to have bought it a couple years after it was released and i personally had fun playing through both sides of the campaign .
but i was literally the only one playing multiplayer .
the environments and the classes and the weapon selections were great .
this is also the sentiment of the very scientist who created the a-bomb .
the duality of humanity in wishing something more and playing the cynical game of geopolitics have been two different things for awhile now .
i remember the suffering when removing those uveprom from the socket to erase program .

i mean what i think op should do is tell his wife how much he 's willing to spend .
she can pick any ring she likes within that budget and if she wants to add more of her own money she can .
they make a ton aid money for dinks and 15k really is n't much to them or even her alone !
he does n't get to unilaterally decide she gets a fake diamond because he thinks she 's being stupid .
many are saying case hardeneds katos and patterns skins is where all the profit is at tho .
never the wrong time to listen to the college dropout .
most of the time i get frustrated because my rank wo n't be as high as i want it to and the other half when i do do good is only followed up with the desire for another game .
i do n't know how to approach this and i wo n't claim to .
ask to see a psychiatrist is the best advice i can offer in your situation .
i do n't know how you feel nor will i claim to but i empathise with you .

yes letting people in to warm-up or stay long after class to stretch is a risk .

you 're trying to combine a higher-level at least level2 thunderwave with a higher-level at least level3 misty step if misty step could be cast at higher levels .
it 's very clearly exceeding the normal power levels of a level3 spell .
thunder step is literally a combination of dimension door 4th level leveled down '' in distance and thunderwave upcast to 2nd level .
would that not also be exceeding the normal power levels ?
as others have implied thunder step gets away with it because it takes away control of the damage .
on the other hand you can just use your movement before thunder step to place yourself anyway .
alternately you can just move and use thunderwave which would do more damage .
the fact that it puts you in harm 's way is an argument to make it stronger not weaker .
very clearly exceeding the normal power levels of a level3 spell
the thing is i see both sides of it .
a fireball at a 120 foot range the same spell level and a larger radius does a little less than double the damage .
a shatter does more damage and blast spells below third level are generally garbage .
movement plus shatter would be more effective all while keeping out of harm 's way .
i do agree that the item would be an interesting non-committal way to introduce it to my players .
in fact based tc is it 's sworn enemy .
i hope things keep getting better for you both .

i do this at a distance and slowly start to work closer to a person .
you may also want to ask for help from some friends .
after you have practiced the rewarding a bit ask a friend to toss a reward towards your dog so your dog associates people with treats .
i would also teach a very reliable command such as sit or down .
when people approach always put your dog in a sit or a down so your dog is focused on working for you .

there are a few other areas not mentioned yet that you can get away with off leash .
just make sure you and your dog wear bright collars as there are fast moving bikers and sometimes hunters .
crown land near petersburg on the other side of the highway overpass .
again wear bright colours and keep dog on leash until 5 mins into walk as there is a swamp on the left as you enter .
monarch woods is n't off leash but is a nice walk even while on leash .

some quotes about the new from stu in case anyone ca n't read what he 's said
the last one is still coming together but it 's definitely less themed like the other four have been .
the four records that have come out so far they were the initial four that came together and they were the ones we had ideas for last year .
and the idea for the fifth one was to have all of the songs – they 're definitely not b-sides or anything .
they 're more songs that did n't work in any of the the rest of the four records or they did n't fit into any of those categories that well or they came together slightly after when those records came together .
for me sometimes songs need a longer or shorter incubation period .
so the fifth record is this place for us to put a lot of different ideas that we 're trying to experiment within the song rather than within the whole record .
and for me some of my favorite songs of the year are on the fifth record .
i mean ... people get suspended for really bad late interference hits .
well they were trying to say that out of shame and fear from the current outings of sexual harassment we could end up changing our society to see coworkers being together as similar as relatives .
we will start to not even see them as attractive out of a conditioned fear that any interest will be viewed as harassment .
south park is n't promoting that behavior they have been against it since the sexual harassment panda .
they 're just trying to say that the way our culture jumps on media bandwagons could change the very way we think .
it 's probably something that they noticed in other areas of our lives but this gave them a platform to present it .
whether it be better or worse is entirely up to the viewer to decide .

it 's just barely 10 months plus we did start to get gen3 8 months after gen 2
honestly the first borderlands had far better atmosphere and writing imo it did n't rely for a large part on memes and references for quick laughs .
just because the media does n't produce proof of collusion or wrongdoing does n't mean nothing happened .
if the media had even the slightest hint of evidence they would be shouting it from the rooftops at anyone who would listen .
my god you think every shred of evidence the special counsel has they 're giving to the media to present to us ?
they have leaked every hint of a whiff of anything so far so yes obviously .
there have been constant leaks from the special council the fbi and the intelligence community at large of anything and everything detrimental to trump and you would have me believe they 're not leaking real evidence because of integrity ?
if they had anything concrete cnn would have it in nanoseconds .
a leaky sieve leaks it 's what it does .
as someone who has been playing for the past 11 years save up and buy the best gun possible .
it sucks in the short term because it means less gear and other cool accessories but the gun has much more lasting value and you wo n't get the feeling of being outdone by other people 's superior guns
some people choose to get a 2 dd gb10 running before moving onto db10 .
sometimes people build a megan for db10 and swap shannon out of their gb10 team entirely and put megan in .
the reason i do n't recommend emma is because she needs to be completely skilled to be more useable you can go straight to a face team these days and you would use megan for that not emma in other words you just do n't really need an emma not for db10 at least .

i generally permit them to be throwing daggers '' otherwise known as darts .
oddly they are not light so you cant bonus action them but you can use sharpshooter .
i generally let them use crossbow mastery to get a bonus attack with darts as a thank you for not using the mechanically superior hand crossbow . ''
i also give them the ammunition property for the same reason .
if someone abused it i would reconsider but the only trick i see is perhaps a monk getting that 1d6 damage die .
i have seen where they say 5xp per hour at the table maybe some bonus for completed mission goals .
no the xp difference between pc 's means almost nothing .

why would they be concerned with dvr playback that does n't include commercials ?
i can understand c+3 this is actually the metric essentially used but not l+3 dvr ratings .
thanks i did a quick search in the subreddit for trade '' and ordered by new .
well ... if valve shuts down all the servers and there is no more dota 2 because it 's not worth it .
i 'm pretty fucking sure you can still go back to wc3 and on any server you 'll find an apemso noob '' game on an earlier patch and you can still play the game if you want .
there are even non-icefrog made updates to the old map .
the community might get smaller but it is just as strong as it was before .
i agree and want to hear more about it .
everyone 's been saying it is much better than before and than bigscreen .

it 's a good buy if you have the disposable income and you have at least 3 games you want to play on it now with a few more you 're interested in to be released soon .
i have n't owned a nintendo console since the snes and i am happy with mine .
some games are good for handheld mode zelda is one mario x rabbids and any 2d game others look/play better on the big screen like mario odyssey and xenoblade 2 .
i 'd think of it as a complimentary console to the ps4 for nintendo exclusives and portability but i 'm not looking to play aaa multiplats on it .
that being said i would get games like dragon quest 11 and valkyria chronicles 4 on the switch over ps4 if there is little performance difference .
there 's no way of really knowing since they have n't announced anything about the price .
however we do know that each game will be a fully fledged fully fleshed out game which i assume will be about 50-60 hours game play each .
going by that logic i imagine they will charge standard game price rates for each release .
they may initially start of with the first being £50-£60 and then lower the cost for the other parts .
the first request the wallet.trezor.io page makes after the initial page load is
beta-wallet.trezor.io however seems to use coinmarketcap probably because bitpay does not support all the alt-coins the new beta wallet has price tickers for

the fact that bungie employing these cheating and scummy tactics should not go under the rag .
how can they take away content that we have already paid for ?
when i think you reached bottom bungie you do something afterwards to disprove me and show a new low .

after a bunch of restarts two re-pairs and an update to ios 11.0.3 they started working and have continued to work thank goodness ! .
so i did n't want to risk them breaking again .
the volcano was still the best board interaction but the chest is pretty cute
the hammer you have has only 160 attack that 's very low for hr 7 especially if you want to fight a hyper monster .
the basic petrified hammer will give you 210 attack if you fully upgrade it it does n't require any crazy materials so you should be able to craft it without any issue .
you can then use that to farm parts for other weapons .
as other people have mentioned you need 10 points to activate a skill so if you do n't know that you 're just running around without any advantages .
i am not a hammer user but i 'd wager a a high rank glavenus armor would be an okay pick if you do n't want to play with mixed sets .
it should also be easy to farm since his head takes ridiculous damage and you are a hammer user so it should pair rather nicely .
also using things like demondrugs and armor skin potion could give you that extra edge and save you a minute or two during a long hunt .
i 'd also look into optimizing your palico setup .
even if you do n't want to minmax just getting one with a trap skill will give you a free trap during a hunt .
a healer could also be useful if you find yourself getting hit a lot .
also use traps yourself lategame they are very easy to craft and are expendable .
always take all the traps you can and materials to make more .
if you do all that and still ca n't take down those monsters ...
i 'm afraid there 's nothing left to do than getting better at fighting a particular monster and using your weapon .
learning other weapons can make a difference as well some of them work better in certain situations than others .
i see the sort of vibe you 're going for epic and somewhat ethereal so maybe you 'd dig a few of these .
a few are slightly outside the genre so hopefully the admins do n't mind

honestly i think a lot of this has to do with the fact that the na pool community is entirely focused on competition .
there 's bca apa cash tournaments but no learning-oriented groups .
i lived in germany for a couple years and joined a club e.v .
where pretty much the whole point was to bring everyone up to as close the same level as possible .
we met 2 days per week to just play 9 and 10 ball for a few hours and one day a week we met to do drills and only drills led by the strongest players in the group on a rotating schedule .
we had a bca team but we just put willing and ready players onto the team and the rest of the group supported them by coming to games and practicing together .
i moved back to the states and even my bca team of which i 'm a really new member never practices together .
it 's just assumed that learning happens in private which is stupid because people learn better as a group .
i think this individualistic model is what leads to a weaker overall player base .
the na pool scene offers a lot of opportunities to show off or compete or distinguish yourself but it does n't have a good social structure for creating learning spaces .
it 's fine that you do n't like trick2g but come on you talk about how trick is able to keep audience when he is kinda hype man and have a personality unlike dyrus who do n't even have a personality and is just like a robot or sneaky who use shity memes and 6yo jokes.i can see people liking sneaky because he puts effort but come on dyrus is most boring streamer expect his lcs career which might interest people .
i 'm glad you refuse but then i have to wonder what happens to the poor animal .

i like that one might use that myself when i 'm involved in a discussion i clearly do n't understand the premise of .
leaving the eu unlocks massive amount of potential in trade deals .
we will be making them all on our own terms .
only a fool is going to presume that being able to conduct trade deals with 70 of the global economy which was previously locked to us under strict terms would have a lower value than trading with 30 of the global economy .
the only issue i see currently is that due to the nature of what we are doing it will take quite some years for these figures to translate into set in stone trade deals .
and hence it 'll take quite some time until it becomes are bluntly visible to people who struggle so hard to see past the headlines of the guardian/independent .
expecting a range of possible costs and benefits during a point in time where we have n't even reached trade deals in negotiations is laughable .
i still ca n't fathom how you ca n't grasp the concept that we are still in the earliest phases of this decision and the opposition currently faced is a politically charged one .
there would be 0 benefit in these negotiations to be drip feeding its own population with numbers supporting it 's position .
hence why the government has not and continues to stay vague that 's how governments work during negotiations .
you using the word naive is incredibly ironic with all of your comments on the matter taken into account .
edit and as a point off the side here .
the vague numbers you 're looking for will lie in the relative economy sizes of the markets we previously had access to versus that of the market we will have access to .
or look at the statistics as to how much we import from the eu being representative of how dependant we are on them vs how much we export to them .
given the nature of how large our economy is coupled with the fact that we are significantly favoured towards importing from the eu this will be a large long term benefit .
arguing against those simple facts and conclusion would be fruitless it 's as plain as it gets .
gongfu is a chinese term referring to any study learning or practice that requires patience energy and time to complete .
in its original meaning kung fu can refer to any discipline or skill achieved through hard work and practice not necessarily martial arts .
gongfu tea brewing needs attention and concentration and a commitment to what you do at that moment then fully appreciating the tea and it 's flavor .

first part of the show sounds like bullsh*t. coincidentally popping on the guest special the day before '' no matt sent you a clip you needed help playing .
let me guess he crossed the street and curses mexicans with gas powered blowers .
while it does add overall weight to the rifle and thus help absorb a minute amount of recoil through weight it is in the literal least desirable position .
for reference my crux saxon 9 weighs 10 ounces suppresses better than that 762sd or my 762sdn6 ... and weighs wait for it ... 10 oz .
that 10 oz can will shoot 338 anything and below .

i just got my 4th ayaka and second luneth on 32 tickets with no aura .
what god wants me to do with 4 super healers i do n't know .
i have a friend who 's in the 190 iq range .
this is a result of his ashkenazi jewish genetics .
if you 've ever read about how this phenomena came about there was essentially an inadvertent compounding iq effect by way of accountants becoming the most valuable bread winners in europe .
my average iq of 90-110 compared to his is probably a similar iq to that me comparing myself to an insect .
a large majority of ultra orthodox jews are ashkenazi .
if you know anything about ultra orthodox they have some very insane legalist rituals .
for example women are n't supposed to show their hair in the synagog so they instead by color matching wigs .
also men are n't allowed to carry keys but if they 're put in a pouch and wrapped around their neck it is considered furniture '' .
yet every single one of these people would probably on average score higher on an iq test .
so these are n't secular people working at nasa .
their intelligence practically speaking goes to debating objectively stupid and impractical things .
they make no contribution to society with their intelligence .
on the other hand there 's adopted children whom share no genetics with their parents ethnicity who are trained and coached and brought up to excel as much as they can .
i saw one article about this with caucasian couples adopting african children .
even though they were trained very effectively they only increased their iq 1-2 points compared with other african children not raised under caucasians .
my point is that the only the only way iq can drop is through genetics .
what you do or do n't do makes no difference .
the question that should be asked is if you want to get to the are we gon na be an idiocracy ? ''
so far the trend of the last quarter century has been towards responsible intelligent people having low birth rates and irresponsible stupid people breeding like mad .
i honestly do n't know who the singularity will favor .
maybe if abortion is as easy as pressing a button on your iphone then dumb people will reproduce less .
or maybe future birth control will not have all the downsides it has today .
if this is the case then births our of wedlock will level off .
but this leads only one class of people who will continue populating while everyone else is selfishly pursuing their own needs religious people like mennonites ultra orthodox jews muslims .
mennonites are opposed to technology but jews and muslims are n't .
i suspect all religions will have difficulty keeping their young people from absorbing technology .

now you will note that nowhere in that list is check for spinal damage or neck injury .
whilst you should be careful if you can the primary aim as noted by entropynz is to prevent further damage which is highly likely for someone lying face down in the middle of a lane on a busyish road .
there are quite a few instances of drivers in crashes dying because their heads have slumped forward against the steering wheel .
rescuers even trained ones have n't wanted to cause neck damage so they let the head stay slumped forward which blocks the airways and people who would otherwise survive suffocate .
okay firstly full respect for your opinion and post here .
like you 're totally right about the tonal shift but the way you make the same points about james m is much better and not straight up hateful like others .
youre calling out the behavior you see and not in flowery terma but not in a way that id see as necessarily insulting .

i am part of the thing you dislike passively because i just want to be apologetic for the out of turn shit some people .

i 'm 100 the page was edited when i looked at the source code it showed something else on it but in the page wasn't..
it 's similar to what you posted on the edit
i did n't though you already saw it and i just ignored it fk
is there any way to check an older version of the source code ?
i wish i had bought more had i known .

as a straight male chemist this photo sure causes some confusing feelings .
only thing i may be noticing is less killing animations though i do n't know if this is all in my head .
and when i did start learning vim i spent too much time configuring shit .
unfortunately i think you put the cart before the horse by no fault of your own i mean .
note that in my previous post i suggested a whole lot of learning potentially a month or more of regular use before even touching .vimrc .
to make things work the way you want/expect of course .
but pretty much nothing about vim works the way you 'd expect note this means that vim is in fact very opinionated — if you do n't think so try making tabs work the way they do in any other program .
so when you try to configure vim before you 've learned how it works you 're naturally going to wind up fighting against vim 's opinions paradigms which means you 're going to have a bad time .
this is true of any program — only most new consumer programs share a common set of foundational opinions so you do n't even realize that they 're there .
it 's true the vast difference in opinion between vim and all the polished gui software we grew up on makes the initial barrier to entry far greater .
but as you can see from a lot of the responses in this thread nobody gets over the hump and says they wish they had n't wasted all that time on it .

also something to note is that they have been picking on isabelle for a while and she just never let them get to her .
she tans a lot and looks super orange so everyone judged her and lotan hated that he could n't control her .
because his side of the house worshipped the floor he walked on .
a couple of episodes earlier the two sides of the house were fighting and loren pretended to be in the right and isabelle stood her ground and pointed how hypocritical he was being and put him in his place he hated it .
i dug it but i do find salters animation to be a bit bland .
i might be biased from jp whos had all the touch ups and such but the lack of repeating card animations is a bit irksome .

reputation shared between characters for factions that are ridiculous to grind out .
vanilla factions outside of the city reps pre-110 legion reps cata reps etc .
main hub factions such as cities or the primary protagonist faction of an expac have n't ever been much of an issue .
they are pretty standard und great scotches but also they are nothing very special or magical .
i 'll leave my upvote at the highland park 12 post .
that game was something truly unique and for 2 or 3 months it did something with gamers that no other game achieved before .

while it of course had major flaws due to it 's rapid and huge success it was still something special .

i 'm saying that a lot of older gay men are super creepy in my experiences .
or maybe a lot of creepy gay men are old .
i believe most casual players which should be most people only play 6 games a day to get the 100+100+120+120 gold bonus plus another 100 for good credit score .
that gives us 540 gold per day these 540 gold is not included in the 500 daily gold cap .
take another 100 first win of the day off the daily gold cap leaves us with 400 gold in the daily cap .
play 5 more games win or lose get around another 160 gold at least .
which comes to about 800 gold per day playing 6 games very casually .
every 3 days you can buy yourself a level 3 arcana .
every 25 days you can buy yourself a 20k gold new hero .

you can choose to plan for the worse case scenario and then if the best case scenario occurs you will either get to retirement earlier or have a better funded retirement .
what we are noticing is that friends and family who had been planning for an age 60 or 65 retirement are being let go at about 55 and then they are shocked to discover that nobody wants to hire a 55 year old .
many are finding that they are ok but some wished they had saved more .
i do n't know if this pattern will be replicated 20 years from now .
it is possible that slower employment growth will mean that employers will be desperate to hold onto their experienced employees .

the gang at most subs not named jurassic park mostly r/movies think that any marvel/star wars film is already fantastic even though they can be pretty bad/average .
i will add to what already has been said .
when you do quests treat them like a movie it worth turning up the sound some newer quests have voice over i loved the sound effects of a tzhaar some rocky-lava creatures quest brink of extinction and missing presumed death you just enjoy the story get into it just like watching a movie except you are also an actor .
some quests are really sad you decide fate of some in-game characters in others some are funny some are trolling you tell any rs player one small favour '' and they get mad immediately but it 's worth getting into the story
i think i went to other games before this one but the game that stands out in my mind was the 2000 usm vs bama game .
usm won 21-0 and i remember feeling bad for bama because it was n't fair for a tiny school like them to have to play a juggernaut like southern miss .
my question then would be if it does get hot will the heat eventually damage the machine ?
or does the heat just mean it will suffer from performance issues because it has to cool down .

they do n't stack but between the x8 tome new player book token and 5-man dungeon bonus you should be getting 900-1000 exp .
at that point an extra 50 is n't as noticeable .
if you use multiply tokens make sure you have at least 4 in the party preferably 5 and skip the siaulai mercenary missions .
my first time around i made the mistake of being stingy with them .
when i hit 330 i still had a bunch left .

if you 're 110 it should n't be too hard to make 4k gold
it 's interesting i feel like the it 's fun '' incentive should be should '' be why we play games in general .
but there 's something about short single-player content that 's just ... different .
a recent release that sort of highlights this for me is fidel dungeon rescue .
it 's a great game really really good honestly and on-theme !
once you 're done you 're done start over .
but that also means that like hs 's dungeon run runs are pretty short an hour or less .
and there 's a lot to discover a lot of hidden bits and evolving content that 's what kept me coming back after having beaten it several times .
but then it just sort of ... got stale .
the developers recently released some new content for it that i 'm excited to try out so my example is a bit flawed in that regard .
so maybe this feeling comes from how quickly the game gets stale .
i think what people want is not necessarily rewards but a way to keep the novelty keep it fun .
rewards are a means to that end more rewards means i can get new cards that is experience new content !
i think it 's a shame democrats forced franken out without the opportunity to investigate these claims and now with him out of the senate i do n't think it 's likely they follow through with an investigation .
if they conduct an investigation and find the claims have merit then we know we did n't force an innocent man and a great public servant out of office and that the right thing happened .
if they find to be as many suspect a plot by roger stone/project veritas then that is something we need to know .

virginia is known for viognier it 's the official state grape .
there are lots of good vineyards in the state .
it 's always neat to get something local in my opinion .
most grocery stores have a local section and even abc stores stock some va wines .
the only thing about viognier is it 's not super dry .
it 's a bit on the fruity side with a kind of honey flavor .
if you think they 'd like that then it could make a nice gift .
my 3yo twins play the various lego superhero games on xbox .
i am increasingly amazed at how good they are at it anything that does n't require reading very little reading in this game they can do .
they know all the different characters powers who can solve what puzzle etc .
it 's also perpetually a good lesson in teamwork and compromise .
the lego games are really good because the characters do n't die '' they just explode and respawn right where they were which is great for them learning and since it 's lego 's the violence '' obviously is n't realistic .
we are a very tech centered family so are n't too bothered by screen time .
they also play a lot of things on their kindles and have learned a ton from those .
most native speakers do n't know these days either .

not only does it get old for the other teams but more importantly he 's hogging all the gym spots for other players to put their mons in .
situations like this are why i agree that multiple accounts are a problem .
edit i may have slightly missed your point at first .
you 're right for people you do n't know how could you tell ?

yes you are talking about the ability to know that a deck has improved by a particular cut .
the general consensus is that any 61 card deck has a better 60 card deck within it we just do n't have a practical way of definitively figuring out what that deck is within a limited time frame of testing .
i do n't disagree with the part in the parentheses .
but i do disagree with the general consensus about the theoretical best tuned '' deck .
there is no reason whatsoever to believe that cutting the worst card in an ideal 61-card deck will result in an improved deck .
again i am not talking about the practicality of calculating whether it is better or not .

with that said my guess of strong decks up until zoo booster is released .
runner ups solid decks with ability to steal games but have an exploitable weakness that sets them behind the others
just my thoughts based on my experience and talking to other competitive players on how often they see the match ups and how favourable they have been or performing .
also i do n't think the contender list for good decks has ever been this diverse .

tämä liittyy huumevalistus propagandaan jossa puhuttiin kannabiksen piikittämisestä koska itse valistajilla ei ollut mitään kosketuspintaa itse käyttäjiin ja valistuksen '' nimissä on ihan ok sekoittaa heroiinin piikittäjät kannabiksen piikittäjiin niin lapset pysyvät erossa ... se että se ei ole totta on harvemmin ongelma huumevalistuksen osalta sillä kaikki tehokeinot on pitänyt käyttää tarkoituksen pyhittäessä keinot .

if i were you i 'd chance my arm trying to to replace coveny
i laughed at this for a good minute it was hilarious .
bruh if you have a problem with me than just ignore me it 's not that hard .
hey all players got a free cyl and good ghb units as well as bk
i 'm not sure of the cross but they look like what we 've always called marion berries ours are n't ready but our own little raspberry haul has begun !
he does have wings but not really sure whether he has enough control to do it willingly yet .
i 've seen the autopsy of jane doe and i liked it very much and i saw the poughkeepsie tapes .
i have no doubt that su gets a lot of vocal coaching and can do much more with her voice that sing straight .
that 's true for most pro singers but they do n't perform with those alternative voices they stick to what fits the music .
i want her to grow and have fun but always within the context of making the best music since they already have essentially two greatest hits albums .
hello that very much sounds like you both have different versions of the game .
this game has it 's servers split by regions .
check the title screen in both of your and your friend 's copy of the game .
at the bottom there will be a last line of text .
this will either say sony atlus or namco bandai .
sony is the japanese version atlus is the us version namco is the eu version .
you both need to have the same version to be able to connect with each other .
bioshock was great but as a game i think galaxy is much better .
bioshock managed to bring a more serious and thoughtful game to the mainstream though .
it may hurt but should help get rid of it .
it 's compiled into a device-independent bytecode which is then interpreted by a separate program the java runtime .
python does the same thing although it does it when you start the program instead of at a separate compile step .
the difference here is that java knows more about the program when it compiles it python can change more details as its running so java compiles take longer to do but the resulting code is faster .
java for example can remember at run-time what machine code it ran for a specific piece of byte code so it does n't need to re-figure out how to interpret it if it sees the same byte code again .
that was my best guess as well it still seems odd you could be waiting years for everyone to leave i do n't plan to unless necessary for example .
i requested it to be held at a ups store near my house because people have been stealing packages from my building .
i 'm not really sure why they need to talk to me i was under the impression it was a simple change .
the store is like three blocks from my apartment .
idk that does n't sound good either but i get what you 're saying .
not that it becomes understandable to sexually harass or assault someone but that understandable that there 's confusion especially when people exist who like to use the most extreme version of adjectives to describe mild events .
like amidst all the scandals of sexual assault coming out lately which is a good thing it needs to be heard recognized and punished there will undoubtedly be people who jump on the bandwagon and scream sexual assault cause a stranger or even someone they know accidentally touched their elbow one day .
money is meant to be enjoyed go have some good wine scallops and high-end sex .
i mean my grandfather died young 69 on christmas eve but that just turned christmas into a time we take to remember and celebrate him .
but then he absolutely adored christmas and would n't want his death to spoil the holiday .
i can understand how a death could do that but in my family 's case it just made christmas more important .
well you cant play ranked with your 4 of your friends so could start practising
while i disagree with the fact that you 're censoring your post for people who do n't want spoilers in a fucking leaks subreddit and who imo should n't be here at all i respect everything else you said .
i did n't see the insults so out of context it just looked like you were being an ass or trying to take a condescending tone .
well done sir both of the ladies are gorgeous .

okay so i just want to double check on the size of the prongs .
here is a quick sketch with some notations http imgur.com/zawgznn .
when you say the length of the mouth do you mean the length across the mask at the jaw line a in the sketch ?
or do you just want the tip of the prong to be at or below the bottom of the jaw ?
because using a as the length of the prong will mean that they will meet in the middle without coming all the way back up to the line of the mouth ? .
using the distance from the line to the jaw would make them more similar to the images you 've provided .
on the topic of hair is there a way you could get a more detailed shot of the sprite ?
something similar to the more detailed headshot of nuru you provided .
i 'm not terribly good at interpreting pixels with that kind of resolution .
or even just a photo of that hairstyle on a person would help .
do you want the eyes to just be simple cutouts or do you want something more complex like a wire mesh or a raised area of drilled holes ?
also do n't apologize for the wall of text i appreciate it .
it 's irritating when people want something but they do n't provide details .
edit i should also mention that this project could take a while since i 'll be doing this all by hand .
the difference being obama does n't act like a whiny bitch about their existence .
edit seeing as i 've triggered the trump-tards for stating a simple truth let 's be clear donald trump is a fat whiny bitch with self-image issues .

these are actually reaction wheels https en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/reaction_wheel which use rotational acceleration of the wheel to directly produce reaction torque .
a cmg rotates a spinning wheel on an orthogonal axis to produce its torque using gyroscopic forces which are orders of magnitude larger .

sorry for being snappy it 's just that bitcoin does n't meet any of the definitions of a true ponzi .
btc has n't found its final form yet but it is therefore hard to define value .
it has one value for people who want to buy illegal things .
it has another value for people looking to avoid fiat inflation .
it could have increased value if more businesses accept it .
it has value to international travelers and international transactions .
it has value to migrant workers who want to send payments over borders without fees .
so it is hard to quantitate but btc has real value in the small advantages it currently offers .

those were some of the best games this company made next to r c and resistance .
i really wish the current license holders would care more about these games and actually develop content rather than leave this franchise in the dirt that is skylanders .

i tried searching for such a topic but ca n't come up with it .
ah koume you 're supposed to be creepy but you 're too darn cute
you 're probably right but on the other hand it could make people question their beliefs .
i 'm not really sure how to persuade them if they have n't already seen the light . ''
this study https jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/750/html might help get into the mindset of a trump supporter but upon examination the conclusions are a bit frightening .
among the 5 main psychological factors associated with trump support are prejudice shocking right ?
preference for authoritarianism yikes lack of intergroup contact they are n't exposed to those different than them social dominance orientation relative deprivation ex .
they may feel persecuted even though they 're not or feel poor even if they 're not .
the best thing i can think of is to expose them to people who 'break the stereotypes ' they hold to offer data that contradicts their beliefs though i have heard of phenomena where people dig into their beliefs more after being exposed to contradictory information .
i do n't think its a death cult they just tell their guys if you turn on us or if you get caught alive we are going to torture your whole family and everyone you love to death '' .

the gorge really is a 24mm wasp the airflow level is very similar gorge airflow does come in at an angle unlike the wasp though .
the gorge is maybe just a tad more open but that is using the exact same coiks in both the gorge would be more restrictice with a larger id coil too since its deck is a bit larger .

in statistics and econometrics particularly in regression analysis a dummy variable also known as an indicator variable design variable boolean indicator binary variable or qualitative variable is one that takes the value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome .
dummy variables are used as devices to sort data into mutually exclusive categories such as smoker/non-smoker etc. .
for example in econometric time series analysis dummy variables may be used to indicate the occurrence of wars or major strikes .
a dummy variable can thus be thought of as a truth value represented as a numerical value 0 or 1 as is sometimes done in computer programming .

so one of the sons of the family who is 18 volunteered to go up into the mountains with the christmas tree permit and find the perfect tree cut it down drag it out and bring it home .

he finally finds one it 's about 16 feet tall to reach to the ceiling in this house it 's in .
they hung it up as shown but the dad decides it 's too tall and he does n't want to have to put lights on it all the way to the top and decorate it .
so it hung there for a few days with half of it gone until he got around to lowering it like it is now .

how do you feel about trump talking about grabbing women without their consent ?
you can change the default font s firefox uses at about preferences languages and appearances .
i 'd imagine she 's like the vast majority of women and sex is just another part of a power game how dare he opt out .
but i thout tax cuts cauze ressecions and that socialism works herp derp .
they 've been trying to hire more cops for years .
you do n't want to continue that line of thought .
the fucking chin and spitting when he yelled which was all the time .

and so are dems chances of taking the house in 2018 i think .
because now the defining issue is n't going to be the healthcare bill or the tax bill it 's going to be the social issue of metoo and dems have lost on social issues since the new deal realignment .
i love this story and i look forward to seeing you revisit it in the future .
do n't get me wrong i love small worlds but it 's nice to see you change it up now and again .

i 'm just checking on major apartment websites and the ones in berlin look so much better and are cheaper .
most apartments in bcn do n't have heating plus they are n't renovated/insulated so it gets freaking cold in winter .
apartments can be dark and not nice at all and can still easily cost like a 900-1000 euros plus utilities for 50 square meters .
i 'm in canada new brunswick and absolutely agree with worldwide that you should order from darts corner .
i 've placed 5 orders from them and i 've had no issues with stuff coming into canada through customs .
keep in mind that shipping can get pricy if you order large items like boards but for darts accessories shirts you 'll be fine .
last i checked they only had 3 different sets but they 're reasonably priced .
also if you 're looking for a new board they have the blade 5 for 80 .
keep in mind that all of costco 's online prices include shipping .
also the odds of the one vector if we 're to believe it being the one pinhole to which all the da secret goodies are accessible is a huge stretch .
you 're talking about degrees of separation and maybe the da is n't big or smart enough or maybe they 're arrogant to setup fake networks for malware testing but for one guy 's login to be the only in — to me that 's even more of a stretch .
they 'll either bury it with action so it 's forgettable or it will come back as a plot lever .
rescind all trumps proclamations and push to repeal all repug sponsored legislation .
i have a theory that feeling type personalities are more prone to having add .

i currently have two berners an 8 year old and an 8 month old .
they always want to be where the family is .
prior to the berners i had a nova scotia duck tolling retriever .
still a great dog but he did n't need us as much or desire to always be with us .
it 's always fun returning home letting the dogs out of their crates and being swarmed !
i think this is a very important issue that is being ignored by most participants in the field .
i 've been running a parity tracing on pruning archive '' node for more than a year .
the reason i do this is that i 'm developing off-chain auditing software .
the tracing mode allows me to follow every transaction down into the lowest trace in an attempt to re-create the value transfers including tokens off-chain .
the archive mode allows me to get account state eth balance and token balance at any block .
over the past two months the size of the archive data has grown nearly half-again as large as it was 300gb to 450gb .
the archive data has grown so large and there 's a bug in parity that exacerbates the problem that i am almost to the point of giving up on the double check '' aspect .
everyone is focused on the front end of the chain .
they used to show the last 5,000 blocks but they now only show the last 1,500 blocks .
i think the implications of losing historical data is a huge problem .
show me one company that will switch its operations to an accounting system that does n't keep historical records .
at the current rate of growth only a few very well-funded companies will be able to hold all the data and the rest of us will be left asking please may i have my list of transactions ? ''
it seems to bring out the total worst in people .

i was just wondering about this ... say you leave a comment on a sub reddit and someone comments with just the most vicious awful thing ... is that as much of an energy hit as interacting with someone in person ?
especially if they are barreling a big thing of bad intentions in your direction because for whatever reason your comment really hit them badly ... .
the first amendment is there to protect unpopular speech for a reason .
if they have crossed a legal line and threatened or assaulted you that is a crime and you should involve the cops .

on my computer i can definitely see the uncompressed from camera version is better but ca n't tell the other two handbrake h.264 or x265 hevc apart .
guessing youttube compresses the original version down on upload and all three end up similar .
my conclusion is original version is definitely better than compressed ones but the benefit of the size reduction of the compressed ones are worth it so i will continue deleting originals after compression .

i started fencing some 6 months ago and im having trouble against this one fencer .
they are strong on the offensive and they quite often block my blade and close the distance .
and then due to me being quite tall and inexperienced i lose because i cant pull my blade out of that close distance fight .
each unit is specialized in end game to be useful in 1-2 areas .

i not really big on large open world games .
i liked battlefield 3 campaign not so much 4 hitman games are good my favorite game right now is robocraft on my computer which is coming for xbox1 .
i liked uncharted 3 but i never played the others i played the crap out of disney infinity 2 and 3 i have pretty much every character purchased stop laughing .
not to bag on botw or odyssey they 're both great games but they kind of get an auto win because they have bigger communities and more people automatically know about them .
kimono can be a bitch and a half to wear properly .
you should be looking for a yukata much simpler though like others have told you somewhat out of season .
you should still be able to find one at yodobashi camera if not there is a kimono store in isetan that should have one though it is pricey or be able to direct you to someplace that does have them .
there is a yukata store near shijo too i think that is much cheaper .

i have a small trade stack out on gdax and just set a small sell above market and the same amount buy below market .
it was up and down a lot so i completed a bunch of pairs .
if they complete cool i made some money and set some more pairs .
the sell completes cool i have a bunch more bitcoin if it keeps going up and if it goes down i complete my pair .
if i hit the buy and the sell hangs out there i 'm like cool i 'm mostly a hodler so i do n't want to dump my bitcoin lower .
i just do n't get greedy and set these orders with a fraction of a bitcoin and always tell myself i am fine with however it plays out .
so far i 've made some extra money instead of just being a hodler .
since gdax has free limit trades it makes it even easier .
it feels to me that someone badly wants it in that specific price range .
definitely worth the time to set up your own node .

i read so many posts where people will talk about cumming after someone did this or that like it 's awesome .
i know cumming feels great i get that ... .but unless you are sneaking have some place to be have kids why in general do people think cumming faster is better in general ?
i see it a lot here that longer seems negative and i do n't get it .
is there some reason the majority seem to prize cumming sooner than later ?
i am female and generally have no trouble with orgasm generally but even when i do i do n't really care it all feels awesome assuming the person is kind generous invested so why is sooooo much put on o ?

skopek soon became intimately involved with singer one of hollywood 039 s top film and tv directors whose credits include the usual suspects and four movies in the x-men franchise and shares for the first time how he found himself pulled into the director 039 s orbit of on-set visits expensive private dinners ready access to drugs and alcohol and sexual encounters with an ever-revolving cast of multiple participants .
quot if mr. skopek had a problem with bryan he never mentioned it before today quot a spokesperson for the director told deadline on friday .
quot we 039 re in the basement me and the other two kids we 039 re kind of chilling .
bryan takes us up one by one and gives us all a molly quot skopek said .
skopek who worked as a host and cashier at tender greens in west hollywood and continued writing songs inspired by his life in southern california said his big-break had not come and he found it increasingly difficult to afford the cost of living in los angeles .
quot so many times i 039 d come over and bryan would cry himself to sleep 039 i 039 m so depressed .
i 039 m spending so much money on lawyers for the michael egan case 039 quot skopek said .
while skopek 039 s dreams of becoming a songwriter never materialized despite his proximity to fame the compositions he wrote about life in l.a. provided inspiration for his current project .

i made one this morning and i 'm fairly certain i know how to remedy it but i 'm just curious to hear what other people 's recipes are that may help !
22g of coffee to 360g of third wave water .
ground about 5 clicks finer than i normally would for a wave on an encore .
50g bloom for 30s stirred like a bandit . ''
one continuous pour for about a minute and a half .
i am assuming i need to grind finer just a tad hesitant since i 'm used to being more on the coarse side .
also open to suggestions aside from a continuous pour method i usually pulse pour on my wave .
i can trade back other breedjects with egg moves and ha i have plenty different ones too many to summ up i can show when we trade .
i got the parents trough wt and giveaways the parrents are prob not legal but i breed the children myself so they are 100 legit .
so i have a nspire cx cas running 4.2.0 .
however i need to use the student software which seems to only be available on 4.5 .
i ca n't upgrade my calculator 's os without using the student software so how can i update the os without the student software ?
i am creating a link to my latro in the mist write-up for those interested as i occasionally get some pms about it .

i got into a small argument on reddit and for some reason the person i was arguing with told me to define fascism .
i remember reading the doctrine of fascism by benito mussolini once so i started skimming it in order to give the guy a definition of fascism from the source .
afterwards i started rereading it and i just realized something there is very little there .
the entire book is full of appeals to the state the nation or morality without any actual logical basis .
it was basically an elongated version of trump 's make america great again '' slogan .
it 's no wonder fascists have to resort to fear-mongering and propaganda to gain power their entire ideology is based on pure emotion and flaky logic .
i 'm working on an online service that allows users to fill out their green card application securely and online and print it out directly on the properly formatted forms .
i 'm looking for an opportunity to talk to current legit green card applicants to understand what the pain points in the process are i went through it myself 5 years ago .
especially if you 're in the middle of it right now i 'd love to talk .
i usually have a proscribed scene in mind when i post but today i have something a little more general in mind .
maybe it 's just these cool fall months making me all sappy but i 'm really eager to try an rp with a lot of romance and affection .
some real sentimental lovey-dovey type stuff know what i mean ?
of course it 's not as simple as all that .
what i 'm really looking for is a non-traditional partner .
have a furry character you 've been wanting to play as ?
maybe a sexy fox lady or a cute chubby cowgirl ?
well that last one might be hard but i 'm sure we could figure something out !
a naughty succubus here to corrupt my soul with her love ?
in fact i 'd really love to get debauched and weird with our sex .
as long as we keep our strange romance at the center .
as for as kinks go i 'm pretty open .
but i love things like petplay cumplay transformation for both of us maybe !
but i will be starting as just a human for sure cuddles affection lactation strange partners that turn out to be a perfect fit and so much more !
how to increase tab height in firefox using css folder
hi i have a question regarding ram voltage to upgrade a t440p .
everywhere i read it uses ddr3l 1.35v because of the intel i5-4300 .
but when i opened the pc there are already 2x2gb modules of ddr3 1.5v working .
do those one also run in reduced voltage or the laptop supports both ?

second multiple-ot loss by drake 5-5 at home this season .
on december 3 drake lost in 4 ot to creighton 108-100 .
coming off a 7-22 season nebraska is now 7-3 .
in the first 10 games last season nebraska was 4-6 .
it was hot i got to check most of my first .
the only problem was i could n't cum my dick just randomly soften .
maybe it was the jitters and the fact that i masturbated 3 times before meeting up with him or maybe some other reason any suggestions what it might be ?
i still have to coerce him in letting me top him though any tips on how might one do that ?
guy has been running offroad diesel in it since it was a logging truck then let it sit for 3 years after .
it runs fine guy says it was stored with full tanks although by the time i saw it one was on half a tank and the float bowl fuel looks fine .
i have heard the main issue is not storing them full and that the offroad fuel has higher sulfur content which makes it tough for algae to form .
think i will have issues if i replace the filter and run the fuel in there instead of draining the tanks or do i need to drop the tanks and turn them upside down ?

i just got tapu lele from 10x pull sp.att p.att and i have celebi as well .
i 'm not a big casher so i am leaning towards solgaleo to complete my psychic team as he will be a lot cheaper to sustain and get to a point where he makes sense .
i 'm afraid deoxys needs 100s of dollars invested in him until he is even remotely useful whereas solgaleo gets metal coat and is a beast .
before i got lele i was aiming for groudon steelix earth arceus .
already got steelix earth arceus tyranitar at the moment .
i bought a lg g5 last november and have been loving the ability to switch batteries when running out of juice .
it 's a life saver for long days especially when working and not having access to a power outlet .
however its battery performance has sharply decreased and i am not getting 4-5 hours of use location off .
if i switch location on then i get 1-2 hours of use .
it has become shite but i remember battery was ok when i bought this phone it could easily last a day .
do you guys think getting a new battery will solve the problem ?

i 'm playing on top player and some games just feel like you are not supposed to win .
fantastic teamwork one game the complete opposite the next .
i got to the world cup with the us and won it .
beat germany 2-1 in semis and beat france 3-1 in the final .
later in the season we play friendlies against argentina and italy .
not even close matches we were dominated in both .
laterwe play 2 more against croatia and colombia both 0-0 .
they start making unnecessary lob passes which they did not do in the world cup .
this is n't the first time my team has completely switched from good to terrible .
when i played for barnsley epl championship team from england i got them promoted to the premier .
we beat teams like chelsea man city arsenal man u .
yet we lost against smaller weaker teams like newcastle west ham leeds .

i walked into his room and discovered that he uses cheats on his video games !
also all the character development has flown out the window .
i thought i 'd wait until i could make him forget but that 's going to be a while because apparently i have to finish the community center bundles .
he 's also lazy and not romantic at all .
so i know he 'll be salty but i 'll just avoid him .
but is there anything else i should know about ?

for those of you unfamiliar with stand saturday it 's a weekly game where we each create our own stands .
a stand is essentially the personification of one 's willpower which is the power that replaced the ripple hamon starting in part 3 of jojo .
each stand 's ability is completely different to an extent from everyone else 's and really depends on your creativity on how to use it .
in addition to stand abilities each stand has its own stats which represents its effectiveness these are power speed range durability precision and development potential .
this week 's theme is from u/fatiguedwalri road trip songs .
hi i currently sold my zoom lenses and decided to shoot with primes for the low light capability and sharp image across the frame .
purchased zony 55mm f1.8 as this lens received a lot of positive feedback since i have no experience with prime lenses i am not sure how sharp the corners supposed to be compare to the centre .
i shoot a few test photos and i felt the corner at f1.8 are a bit softer than expected is this lens a bad copy or de-centred ?
please let me lend your professional eyes so if this lens is n't a good copy i can still bring it back for exchange .
i placed it on tripod shoot raw ibis off and to avoid unparalleled to the fence i shot 5 images each focus on the centre top left bottom left top right bottom right
dh and i moved and it 's been a few weeks of unpacking .
in fact there was so little drama for at least a month that i held off posting feeling kind of guilty .
mom was being so nice to me that maybe the past was behind us ...
it only took a month after the wedding to fall back into treating us like children and not respecting our decisions .
sharon began the snide comments like let 's go clean the bathroom so i can show you how to keep house .
husband did n't marry you to be a lazy wife.
she informed me though that while i was in better standing on the weekends that i have stayed at dh 's parents ' house she talked badly about me all weekend .
good news around november 1st dh got a good job offer from the company he wanted to work for in the nearby big city meaning i get to stay at my job he 's happy that he wo n't be jobless and we can look for a place .
we went every weekend to look at local apartments/townhouses and found one we like .
by thanksgiving we 're hauling in boxes and unpacking .
saintly sharon of course starts this new chapter in our lives with all the grace expected of a jnmil .
we come over on a sunday night to move all boxes from the spare room to the living room for the move on monday morning .
at least twice she snaps at dh not to bump the detailed wainscoting on the hallway wall rather rudely .
he was getting pretty irritated but took it quietly .
all the while as we haul every box she nitpicks how we packed the things we packed and crowed about how she packed us up so nicely.
after moving it takes us about two days to fully unpack amd wash kitchen things organize kitchen etc .
mil fil stop by to drop off a few things for dh so we do n't have to make a trip .
later sharon hears from mil that they saw the place and she calls me whining about how weee have n't been invited over yet ! then at 9:30 she calls again and in the background she is asking dad to drive her over to see us he 's too tired .
she whines and sighs about not seeing us so to try to appease her i facetime her and carry it around .
she complains that my brother stopped by and saw the house on moving day as well .
i arrange a day to meet up with her for shopping because she offers to buy us a laundry organizer for the dark and spider-y basement .
dh has been freaking out about the cost of each walmart trip to get essentials like shower curtain rods a filter/jug for drinking water etc so he says you should go ! he comes with me and i end up riding with her back to my place because his car broke down in the parking lot .
so sharon brings me back and i show her what i 've unpacked and organized so far and she does n't say a single word for a few minutes .
i dreaded inviting her over after i opened the door because i expected all sorts of criticism but nothing .
she proceeds to teach me how to crockpot a roast with vegetables and then says i 'll straighten some things you have n't gotten to !
let 's bring a little zen into current room repeatedly .
sharon and dad love dinner that night all goes well except dh had eaten with his parents after getting his car towed there and tinkering with it .
my parents frown on eating before you have dinner with someone and make noticeable comments about it .
sharon begins to call me asking if i got much cleaning done .
ok so you ask 3 days in a row i 'm not stupid .
meanwhile s spent the night a couple of times on our couch and has enjoyed the break from being there .
she 's now getting all of sharon 's lectures .
tonight like 3 or 4 other times this past college semester sharon called asking if dh was home .
nope he 's coming back tomorrow he is graduating next saturday and had his last exam yesterday .
saintly sharon oh he 's staying in college town this weekend ?
ss hmm but should n't he stay there and get stuff done ?
me he had his last exam and he wants to come home .
he likes seeing his family on the weekends too ...
ss he does n't have to come home every weekend .
he made the choice to come home every weekend for his 4-day weekends .
i ca n't make him stay there even if i wanted him to stay there .
ss he can go a week without seeing his parents !
and his dad can manage a week without the car !
ss right ... annoying laugh you did n't tell him not to come home ... suck it up buttercup !
anyone who knows me knows that arrogant and bossy phrases like put on your big girl panties and do thing i 'm bullying you about or suck it up buttercup ! really really piss me off .
away goes the guilt and the bff-fuzzies i was getting for a week there .
i went and hung out with her just this week earlier because i missed seeing them and i get lonely in an empty house !
neither dh or i want her to be rude amd condescending about our choices and we are trying to wramgle this before having kids !
so unfortunately i may still be posting to this thread after all .
thanks for sharing your stuff to help dh and i learn how to deal with this .
the patrolling for hours never gets dull with bluberries and public events .
the meditation '' function is great and provides loot for playing some fun missions .
i love the feeling of getting a bunch of loot in the end even if they are individual tokens and blues .
it makes a lot of sense and the system is great .
adventures are great mini missions to play and get some sweet landscape and loot .
i would say the raids are great too but i havent played them yet xd .
and the bright engrams make eververse so much better !
and the guns and armor look so cool especially the exotics .
the weekly milestones add a bunch of replayability and endgame as well !
d2 is just a great game overall and i cant wait to see it get even better .

my sister carol '' is 48 and she is mentally challenged .
she is about mentally 8 years old and has other mental challenges no physical ones .
carol talks to things/people that are n't there constantly has conversations with herself and babbles incessantly about whatever is on her mind at the moment .
my parents have never shared her actual diagnosis with me despite my asking .
a friend in the psychology field who has met her says she 's probably suffering from schitzoaffective disorder but ca n't make a formal diagnosis .
carol had a 40 hour a week office job about 10 years ago but my mother insisted on taking her out of work '' to attend various events and vacations .
as a result of carol 's bad attendance at work and her awful behavior there trying to cast harry potter spells on her supervisor and chasing someone with a ruler her department was reorganized '' and she was let go .
after that my parents did not try to find her another job or put her in job placement .
my mother is delusional and thinks that carol is a star athlete and musician and dedicates a lot of time and money to carol 's leisure pursuits .
carol has n't been on medication for her psychosis since she was in high school .
now my parents are in their 70s and not in the best of health .
my sister lives with them and my mother spends all of her time shuttling carol to her activities . ''
my father does not deal with any of this .
i have tried to talk to my parents about getting them and my sister into therapy .
they refuse telling me they do n't need and that my sister is fine . ''
a year ago my sister pushed my younger son down a flight of stairs during one of her episodes '' while my parents were watching the kids .
my wife now refuses to let the kids go over there unless she or i are with them .
i agree with her my parents claim that nothing happened '' and that my son made up the story .
i fully believe my son and my sister still babbles and giggles about the event under her breath when the kids are around .
i do n't know what it will take for my parents to wake up and see that my sister needs a psychiatrist and should be transitioning into assisted living .
i have told them flat out i will not allow her to live with my wife and i .
my father is fine with that but my mother keeps trying to work on my soft-hearted wife .
although after our kid was hurt my wife has nothing but dislike for my sister
is there anyone else out there in this situation ?
i am also getting a chinese symbol that master roshi has on his ninja suit on my chest which also has deep meaning .
would these be a deal breaker for dating me if you found me decently attractive ...
lets say im a 7 can be 8 if working out an taking care of myself lol .
thank you all so much as i am getting curious how women will feel about me having it .
this might be a shallow question but its what i like and me and i am curious as to what to expect dating wise afterwards..
lolb is the only position in the defensive backfield without a card over 80 speed that can reach 91 zone
i 'm sure it will never happen but i thought it would be really badass to have some sort of dlc game maybe a sequal ?
that would involve the gods and deities of each faction .
knight faction a combination of famous angels and demons as well as some roman gods .
samurai not as familiar with this mythology but i will explore that .
anyway i thought it could easily be made to function similarly to current existing heroes with fighting styles only using different weapons or powers .
i figure powers that typically would be seen as long range would be used in close combat similar to legolas think hobbit fight scenes with point blank shots or arrow .
for example zeus would be typically imagined to throw lighting at a distance but what if he dual wields lighting like a berserker ?
this is just a thought and if it interest anyone just for fun i will absolutely put in some effort to give some detail for as many characters as i could think of that would build up each faction .
hey guys first off i must say i am familiar with the rules and i know in standard cases you ca n't swap usernames with two accounts you own however i 'm wondering if that changes for accounts you can no longer access .
i 'm currently under the handle delphiki and i used to own twitch.tv/delphiki it was associated with a school email address from 4 years ago which i no longer have access to dumb move on my part i know i wanted to ask the community first before submitting a support ticket because i did n't want to waste support 's time .
is it possible for me to get the username back ?
i 'm running a 3d printer and using autocad to make objects after mocking them up in inkscape .
what i get using stlout is an object with an x dimension of 1mm and proportionate corresponding dimensions .
i 've tried changing the units and also scaling the objects up before exporting but they always just shrink down to 1mm .
i posted this same question 5 years ago and the suggestion was to just scale everything up by 25.4 .
this works as a temporary fix but i 'd like the objects to be the exact size i made them .
do you guys think it will correct to 2-3 in the next couple of days ?
only reason i 'm asking is due to the crazy media coverage vs working with microsoft ?
i 've tried a slow cooker and kept forgetting to set it up hours ahead .
i 'm gone about 12 hours a day one time came back to meat so over-cooked and mushy i️ threw it out .
i 've had this pot for 2 days and it works for me
i️ can just throw food in there while i️ wash dishes and my mind wanders .
i wont burn food because it 's set to a timer and then automatically goes into keep warm mode .
the thing beeps which reminds me i️ have food cooking
it 's just one stainless steel pot which cleans up super easy and quick
it 's electric no fear of an apocalyptic gas explosion
i️ do n't have to plan ahead just throw it in and it 's done in a few minutes
i️ was already exhausted from my day by the time i️ put in the potatoes to boil in the instapot .
was n't too worried about falling asleep bc no stove to burn food and my house down so i️ went to bed .
woke up to a pot of perfectly warm potatoes ready to be mashed turned that into breakfast for the kiddos .
still have a pot of warm buttery mashed potatoes for when anyone else wants to eat .
one less task for our adhd brains is a damn plus !
i 'm going to buy another pot to make dinner time even faster and getting the nonstick inner pot for even quicker clean up .
edit i 've been calling this thing an instapot for months i 've just realized it 's called instant pot !

well i switched from vue to sling because of the price increase .
i went from 44.99 was paying 34.99 to about 26 with sling blue .
first thing i noticed right off the bat is lack of 60fps ... it 's really glaring .
some channels do have it but nfl network does n't ... the scroll at the bottom of the screen has so much jutter i ca n't stop looking at it .
in my mind vue was pretty consistent channel to channel .
i 'm happy with the savings i 'm getting i guess .
if they ever brought the price back down i would probably jump back .
one other item i ca n't remember ever having to reset the vue app or having it lock up .
i 've had to force stop sling numerous times orange ring of death already .
i 'm stuck at work basically all day what are your guy 's favorite mut related podcasts to burn some time .
here 's an unpopular '' opinion the death of daniel shavers is a training issue not a criminal issue .
poor training poor leadership and daniel shaver 's stupidity pointing a weapon out a hotel window is why he was shot .
cops should be held to the same standard of criminal accountability as medical doctors when in the performance of their duties .
doctors are stripped of their licenses sometimes and held civilly liable .
very rarely are they found criminally liable and rightfully so .
medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the united states .
i should n't have to say that this is n't one of those times .
some people at good at sports some people are good at singing .
i 've made every girl i 've ever played with cum using my tongue including two or three who had previously said no guy had made them cum .

as you can tell i 'm kind of big headed about my oral skills so i 'm assuming i 'm on the higher end of the scale but would love to find out if i 'm wrong .

i 'm from india i do n't know if people here do n't reply i 'm turning 22 next month and i 've severe hair loss since i was 18 .
the main reason afaik is i had this huge depression and feeling of loneliness due to some family fights and i was accused of being the characterless person .
this made me depressed and also made me afraid of new people i came across in my undergraduate freshman year .
after that the masturbation intensity also increased and i think these are 2 key factors made me lose a lot of hair .
right now i am broke and came here to put this thing here and want to know as to what is problem technically .
i also mentioned this in other post i used to go to random stranger sites and chat for hours and those copp site cumonprintedpics.com which i 'm so afraid to try and do again .
i also made myself change the attitude and worry less but i guess that is not affecting .
just a week ago i 've shown this issue to local doctor and she suggest the long therapy which includes a tablet everyday and a hair lotion to rub on my scalp everyday as follows
i want your guys suggestions and tips on how should i proceed further and will my hair regrow again .
good news is they are growing again slowly now .
also what i want to know is how much time does to take balance the hormones level after ejaculation as i 'm going to force myself to completely stop doing it .
i 've read on few other posts here that is hereditary so i would like to mention that yes my dad both grand father has this .
but they had in their 40s and i got this due to so much of worrying and being shallow and afraid to talk to others at the age of 19 .
as i read more and more about bitcoin 's limitations it became clear to me that the current model is not sustainable and is going to burst one day .
i learnt about bitcoin cash in this subreddit and it seems to be a better solution .
however some coins seem to be surpassing bitcoin already and it could be too late to bch to become the most used crypto currency that would n't be so bad because honestly at this point everything is better than bitcoin in privacy fees or speed .
also recently i discovered bitcoin classic and seems to be very similar to bch and it did n't gain enough adoption when it was launched around 2016 .
so why would you think that this time would be different and what could bch do to gain track what features new or from other coins would be useful to bch to have in the future ?

still johnson told cnn 039 s kate bolduan quot i will not be there tomorrow quot calling trump 039 s planned appearance at the museum opening a photo opportunity .
quot it is unfortunate in fact it is an affront to those individuals who fought for voting rights to ensure that people had quality education and access to health care will be celebrated .
those are principles this president does not support . ''
john lewis and bennie g. thompson said that after quot conversations with church leaders elected officials civil right activists and many citizens of our congressional districts quot they have decided not to attend the opening .
quot we think it 039 s unfortunate that these members of congress wouldn 039 t join the president in honoring the incredible sacrifice civil rights leaders made to right the injustices in our history quot white house press secretary sarah sanders said thursday .

anyone else here less thrilled about futures starting tomorrow ?
these are people with deep deep pockets and existing ties to institutions countries individuals etc who stand to gain a lot from volatility .
if they want to short btc they have the money and outlets to spread some serious fud .
they have no interest in the long term and settle their futures contract daily .

minimum rewards for 0 wins is 10 packs 3 premium alt art lightning bolts .
it is only open for 10 hours hopefully they learn from the last event and change it to 24 hours ...
i wo n't have time to play so i paid the 1000g and selected a deck then logged out .
if you want the alt art and 10 packs pay the 1000g/6 event tickets now .
rewards are really good if you get some wins or go high on the leaderboards .
the article is mostly about her podcast drama but i think her response to one question about the trumps puts her metoo response in a whole different light .
i also think it 's pretty shitty to try and avoid the subject altogether .
she should at least have the balls to say whether or not she voted .
i remember on inauguration day you praised melania trump 's outfit .
now almost a year later how do you think she and her husband are doing in the white house ?
sky blue is my favorite color so i was like that 's what i would wear.
does anyone else has an issue with the upper buttons in the screen off memo not responsing like pen size or eraser or stick to aod ?
neither a fingertip nor the spen will trigger the buttons .
i think of suicide as a compulsion rather than a choice .
it 's not that i 'm sitting there debating and going i 'm in pain i want to die ! ''
it 's more of an instinct to abandon ship .
it makes me want to sit on my hands or pull my hair out or start sprinting .
the familiar scenes of my home become sickeningly predictable .
he also makes jokes hand-crusher reminds me of someone i know is attentive to his friends and capable of being genuinely ruthless like when he made life-threatening ice statues .
his issues with his father are a significant factor in his personality and continue to define a part of him but when you see him let baku walk in front of him or make his personalized japanese room or when he makes a joke to baku about his childish tendencies when he consoles deku and offers him some food those things are all separate individual facets of his being .
let 's put it this way if you see someone making a joke at todoroki 's expense you might have a general idea what he 'll say in keeping with his overall character but it 's not immediately obvious how he 'll respond .
if you made a joke at baku 's expense it 's immediately obvious how he 'll respond .
you can say the same about someone asking them for help challenged by a villian etc .
can you think of any reaction from baku that would surprise you ?
i thought it would kind of obvious but it 's not just in how he talks but the content of the speech itself his default reaction to everything is anger .
swearing is pretty common even in real life it 's a question of what specifically your swearing about .
this ice cream is fucking amazing and die you shitty fucker are very different despite both involving swears how much dialogue from baku is n't an angry swear ?
you say he 's not always arrogant but even in your examples he 's arrogant during the start of the sports festival and his loss is shocking to him precisely because of his arrogance .
despite easily being one of the characters with the most screen-time how much of bakugou 's dialogue can be considered novel funny unexpected or moving ?
you can probably predict maybe 80 of the lines baku will have and i 'd say that 's a problem .
a different employee gets a delivery order wrong and the owner says to me you should know that if we fired anybody right now it would be you .
the end of that very same day look at how much back hit i have !
i swear to god this was a real interaction .
the worst part was that i worked there for another 10 months !
i am not on a mac but if you can find the settings.lua '' file in the installation folder you will be able to edit it to allowing experimental mapsizes .
i do n't know and it probably depends pretty much on your hardware .
make sure to create a copy of the file to revert the changes if needed .
if you can find a mods folder in your tpf installation just move a mod from tpf there and unpack it .
make sure that every mod has its own folder usually already taken care of by the modcreator .
once you start you should be able to activate it .
if you are unsure how to do that i would recommend the tpf mod manager but that is only available for windows and linux and i am not sure if the linuxversion will properly work on a mac system ...
its more like spice pepper '' because spiced pepper '' i would translate to kryddad peppar '' but if you take kryddpeppar then i would say its spice pepper '' or less of a direct translation pepper spice '' .
once when i was on the bus this old man in the seat infront of me turns around and asks me if i know why black people have unusually large butts .
i kind of just looked at him not knowing what to say .
he then goes on to say that he attempted to ask his doctor this question and was disappointed to learn the doctor did not know the answer .
he then went on a small rant about how doctors go to school for so long and should know why black people have large butts .
i still dont know what to say at this point i think i was just saying ya or nodding .
he then starts going on about some theory that the reason why black people run so fast olympics etc is due to their large powerful butts .
i still think about this conversation to this day and am still quite perplexed by how random and weird it was .
only time will tell but i think he has as much chance to go off as any of those three .
i agree with it being weird that anyone would start blowing at a nice pile and spreading it out making me suspicious of the video .
but the part about the kids is easily explained by the mom putting them up to it which is why she 's filming .
i pictured the weird guy as johnny bravo for some reason .
alternatively the blue version is also on sale for 79.99 .

i 'm glad i understand the hydrodynamics and human factors involved in a boat sinking .
i 'm glad i have felt that turning point where the water is going to win when pumping is not going to help when the engine is going to fail when the weight of the water aboard overcomes the force of buoyancy pushing up from below .
i 'm glad i 've felt the sense of panic of being suddenly underwater trapped in a sarcophagus that a moment ago was my safety net .
i 'm glad i 've felt the instinct kick in to say you can survive this you need to stop panicking dive down deeper to get out and then swim up .
it 's going to get worse before it gets better .
go. i 'm glad i experienced that so i know how to react should it ever happen again .
that having been said i 'd be quite content to not be aboard a sinking boat ever again .

your analysis neglects the important structural changes that took place in the 80 's instead opting for the easy answer which is pretty telling of your ideology writ large .

well although there 's no direct link between the two markets there will be lots of indirect linkages .
the psychology and emotions in both markets will have an effect on the other .
we 'll see news headlines such as the futures market believes that btc will be up 20 in december . ''
there will be the market '' expectation of the btc price in dec jan feb etc .
also the thinking is that institutions that are currently not allowed to play in the real market will jump on-board the futures market .
in my example neither a nor b touched the real market .
in real life there will be lots of players who will touch both .
as a simple example let 's say that a actually owned 1 btc at the time they initiated the 1 month contract .
rather than sell it today for 15k they effectively locked in a future sale at 16k .
on the last day they would have to sell it in the real market for x but would collect 16k-x from b or pay b x-16k either way pocketing 16k .
anyone buying or selling will have to choose doing it today or doing it later but locking in the future price .
this may likely have a calming '' effect on price moves .
miners will probably play in the futures market much like real miners do today .

this looks like a desperation attack from someone incredibly behind on board who has something like rally+burn or 2x rally as an out .
it 's not strange that he gets the molot and nakova trigger .
what is strange is that he also keeps all his dudes .
the correct block from opponent perspective is probably to block the east-wind herald with the familiar because losing it to a trick is irrelevant and to block with either the terrazon or one of the guardians .
rally is 15 damage which is n't nothing even from 23 and we have access to skycrag burn .
double rally is 27 and the opponent 's position is so dominant that the play is to not die . ''
the questionable item is whether attacking with the strangers is correct .
if we do n't get the spark triggers we probably lose to 2x guardian pump .
a lot depends on how the opponent has been playing .
if i just attack with the two fliers the supposedly safe '' line are they going to play around spark triggers ?
if not it might not be since we can reasonably expect to chump 8/8s with strangers for a turn or two and attempt to race .
also if opponent is clearly bad at race math and plays too aggressively this is an excellent line .

if you identify with the opposite gender so be it you are then male or female .
while it is true one 's history shows that they have changed genders and/or sex they ought to identify as that gender and not as trans right ?
owning a dog is way more difficult and expensive here considering that you either need to spend time walking it or pay for a dogwalker which goes for at least 15-20 per half hour .
if you want to be around dogs op i 'd recommend volunteering at any of the rescues in the area .
i occasionally volunteer with badass brooklyn animal rescue helping to look after dogs during adoption events but there are lots of rescues that do this sort of thing .
your best bet for not being alone and being able to afford living here is to find a roommate .
heck you might even find one that already has a dog and then your problem is solved .
you could also foster in which case the rescue will pay for vet visits and other expenses and the dog will live with you but wo n't be yours to keep .

i learned that they way police approach a situation is extremely tense .
in my community which is really small and does n't ever experience stuff like this something similar happened to this situation .
long story short police had stopped a car for a general traffic infraction and the situation got bad fast when an officer saw the passenger frantically searching the floor of the car bent over .
officers made commands several times without the man 's compliance he still hunched over .
after several commands to comply with no response from the passenger a shot was taken striking the man in the head killing him .
turns out he was attempting to hide drugs under his seat but was unarmed .
the officer who took the shot was the father of one of my friends and was well known to be a kind and good person but very serious about his duty .
he was released from the police force due to the controversial nature of the situation but was not terminated he was observed having done everything by the book .
like you said if i ever am put in this situation i 'm going to lay flat hands fully extended above my head .
if they want to beat the piss out of me so be it .
if they shoot me let it be known they shot a guy laying on the ground arms fully extended above head .

there were a few hiccups along the way but we were doing fine till october of this year .
she got a job at a haunted house and i was barely able to see her all month due to morning classes and work for both of us .
quite a few things happen in this month that i 'll make a post on r/relationshipadvice for but she said she wanted a 2 week break in the beginning of november .
fast forward to thanksgiving day she asks to meet at the pier in the following saturday and exchange things .
not even so much as a how are you .
i have n't sent her a text back since .
girlfriend put me on a break and two weeks later she broke up with me .
this deranged fuck has no idea what this is about .
so do all that while you 're drunk and if you mess up you die .
lol i actually and often feel that the lipsticks for the promo codes anyway are always nude rose/pink shades .
out of everything i 've seen so far on the internet with police brutality i never became so enraged as i am after watching this .
in past videos i always told myself that their were some real shitty cops out there out of the thousands of good ones but fuck ...
i feel like every person is going to be involved in some sort of intense situation with police once or twice in their life typically it 's just wrong place wrong time but this makes me scared to deal with the police force as a citizen of the states .
i 'd rather get fined and put in jail from running away than risk getting shot in the fucking head .
we created a spreadsheet to keep all the bm wonderful journey related threads in one place .
now we also have an imgur account where we will be uploading the pictures from each city into separate albums for easier viewing .

u/chuuei u/bm-wb-ook i remember you guys have asked me about this
dude do n't let your wife burnout on over burdening with too much empathy
everyone needs to pitch in not some doing all the work
because the systems are fkd change the systems do n't just burn money endless pits
that song was made for singing drunk at a piano bar .
that 's exactly what 50 of the customers who come in asking for nmds call them .
i 'm saying that the wage gap is n't real because there is no evidence that it exist i 'm also saying that it 's far left because it sounds like marxist bullshit .
if you looked at the lines on the road you would know this .
since its inception siriusxm has promised to deliver a diversity of opinions and viewpoints from conservative to progressive to everything in between .
siriusxm takes no political position of our own across our more than 175 channels but we are here to provide an open forum no matter where listeners stand on the political spectrum .
we ardently believe that by allowing a virtually unlimited platform of viewpoints we are doing our best to uphold that core value.
except they 're probably espousing their love for the ideals of free speech bc of capitalism rather than racism .
this is a really difficult concept for a lot of people to wrap their heads around .
the wallet analogy is helpful in one sense but if people do n't look a bit deeper they 'll have no clue where their money is and how they are managing it .
was wearing a hong kong disneyland t-shirt in a restaurant in tokyo .
went to the toilet to pee and met this japanese guy .
apparently he 's a huge disney fan so he randomly approached to stand beside me and start talking how much he likes disney while i was peeing and was washing my hands .
also waited for me to exit from toilet together .
wo n't default to yes but i 'll certainly discuss it with people interested
i ca n't believe that such a brilliant back end has such an abysmal front end .
well i just got it and as a separate individual i thought i 'd express my opinion on an open social media site ... this is why i hate reddit ... a bunch of high horse cock suckers
get the brawling weapons slide attack and they 're off to the void .
it 's not a hard rule but generally i find either this happens or the band will just make a few albums and stop before they decline .
my personal theory is that if a musician comes up with a good idea for a band than the first album or two come naturally as they are directly based off this original inspiration .
what is more difficult is to then force themselves to consistently follow it up in a way that does n't stagnate but also does n't stray too far from what made the band original great .
this could also apply more generally anyone can fall ass-backwards into a great concept and create something incredible if they have the skill to pull it off but it takes something else to be able to sit down and say okay i 'm gon na come up with a cool idea '' and actually come up with something original .
of course this is all based on my own experience and could be entirely biased by the way i think but generally all the interesting ideas i have for books/videogames/whatever are built from little sparks of inspiration rather than an active effort .
i wonder who is more stressed the guy with an assault rifle or more ?
pointing at him who is literally crying and clearly does not know what the cop wants him to do or the police officer with backup and an assault rifle pointed at the guy ?
that 's also what i 'm getting with my stock cooler .
why you think them putting millions of dollars on the game guarantees smite wo n't have those issues ?
paladins is heavily backed up in money too yet they 're perfectly fine in fucking with the balance of that game to the point of not beeing fair
i finished it about a month ago and already invited a few people over for a drink .
i 'll be hosting new years and super bowl so i 'm sure it will be well used !
this was my goal when you could run sentry shield builds .
i would drop my marks and move and let my team mates kill the enemies while pulling agro onto myself .
try even changing the channel via the hue app itself .
i was just saying that because they had n't ruled and i hoped there was a possibility they were part at fault but i 'm pretty sure it 's just me .
my car looks totaled to my family i 've shown as it is so damaged it would be expensive to fix even though it runs

honestly you ca n't expect him to keep it up for 82 games .
michelle 's arc in elephant particularly the locker room scene where you overhear girls gossiping about her really captured the quiet yet relentless bullying some kids go through .
they deleted the tweet so it very obviously was n't true or it was mis-read .
honestly if you pick up my book you 'll see 8 of the most powerful regressions i 've encountered this year .
each regression i do serves a meaningful purpose but the 8 i chose really stood out to me for specific reasons a couple of these clients saw and experienced truly uplifting spiritual things outside of our normal human comprehension of our present reality those are the regressions that make plr therapy worth it for me as my life 's passion .

i think in cases like this were the victim loses his job due to the crime the criminal should be enslaved and become property of the victim to provide a livelihood for them .
20 years ago you could see guys have absolutely storied sometimes legendary careers within a span of 5 years .
guys like edge christian the hardys dudleys and the new age outlaws had amazing runs in wwe that were shorter than you see a lot of talent sticking around for today .
obviously a lot of the guys i mentioned had longer singles runs before and after but i 'm talking in the context of their tag team runs .
for example if we had never saw edge or christian again after 2001 we could legit say we saw an amazing run filled with character development amazing segments and great matches .
kofi kingston has been around for 10 years now but i 'd say before the new day his run would have been remembered as pretty run of the mill .
the usos which this thread is about will now have the record for ppv title matches as a tag team but outside of the last year their characters have never been great .
stories progress too slowly in wwe and it has been that way for the last 10-15 years .
talent is also not allowed to reach their potential .
as a fan i rather take a 6 year the rock wwe career over a 15 year john cena wwe career if that makes sense .
obviously i would have loved for rock to stay for longer .
but he did so much in 6 or 7 years .
it should n't be comparable that a guy who has been there twice as long in the same position on the card has achieved only equal to the first guy .
the trick is to spot the two too many before you drink them and avoid crashing out .
also stay a drink or 3 behind the initial champion let them make the fool of themselves

but my mom twists any attempt of dialogue into me accusing her of being abusive .
as you noted with the unpredictability with copd i have wanted to have a plan going forward .
but again any attempt to discuss and my mother is ranting over me making it a conflict instead of a conversation refuses to provide any information at all and misrepresents what i want to accomplish so that my dad then defends her and i am left knowing less and we have accomplished nothing .
i will indeed investigate the home care agencies though .
my mom mentioned that they have home care insurance .
but when i try to pin down what that entails exactly she ends the conversation .
i usually check the young players released by english clubs '' page and look at the top clubs .

at the moment i 'm taking web dev classes which i joined in order to get a job in the field of programming .
part of the reason why i asked my question is not just about getting a job it 's also to learn useful skills just for the hell of it .
i 've been doing basic programming for like a decade now so i have a pretty damn good grasp of the basics and same goes for what you called fundamentals learning about them in class atm so i focus on other stuff in my free time .
i 've even been learning to use vim for the past few months but turns out i should be using emacs for lisps for whatever reason ?
personally i started looking into haskell recently and also kotlin .
i understand that switching languages is somewhat easy but i 'm interested in learning how to apply the different programming paradigms .
that 's why haskell and kotlin interest me although k also seems useful overall that 's why clojure keeps catching my attention because i wan na learn a lisp and clojure is somewhat related to what i study .
i 'll probably focus on kotlin for now since it 's interesting and useful as well as fun to use overall .
even if it does n't get me a job .
i 'm not great at the whole writing thing .

i think the suspicion that your stock head unit is insufficient to properly drive these speakers is likely mostly the issue .
do you find yourself turning the volume up more than before to get a similar loudness ?
oem speakers are often very efficient and also often heavily bias towards mid-bass .
this leads a lot of people to be disappointed with aftermarket speakers as they are often not always by any means not quite as efficient the more durable and better responding designs are less efficient by nature and the speakers will have a more even response than the stock ones making them seem like they lack bass '' even though they actually sound much more realistic .
i do n't believe speaker break-in is much of a factor if any at all for most people .
while there is some truth to the fact that wearing-in a speaker will change it 's parameters to some degree its probably not at all audible in a system like yours where the speakers are n't in any kind of tuned enclosure and the you 're not tuning the system to a specific response with equalization and time alignment and a rta to visualize that response .
you just would n't hear the difference in such a basic install .

i 'm a clarinet player i remember playing my grad recital at university where half way through i got a soft palate leak .
that 's basically when the little muscle that moderates air flow between your mouth and your nose becomes too weak to work properly and you get air leaking through it .
this is particularly annoying when playing the clarinet because it means a ton of your air is being wasted by going through your nose instead of the instrument .
it 's not a serious injury by any means but it makes breath control virtually impossible .
but i still had half a recital to play .
no because i knew that there was nothing i could do .

game was amazing ... down all 3 quarters we tied 2nd with some of the clumsiest and careless basketball being played while the other team was shooting lights out .
not boxing out free throws by the other team so they got the rebound back losing inbound passes and even pj tucker passing to out of bounds .
then it came 4th quarter and the switch was flicked.. and it was over.. 40-21 .
this is 17-18 rockets with the best offensive player and the best floor general in the league with great defensive players who can shoot well .
no way we would have came back last season but it feels amazing with cp3 luc and tucker on the wagon as well .
i 'm new to woodworking and had a quick question .
i 'm looking for a good 10-12 inch miter saw blade that will cut wood and aluminum .

edit 1 the amazing u/onemachinery gave me rebirth without dlc so i 'm more than happy !
thank you so much for taking your time to read my request !
i 'm requesting the complete bundle with rebirth afterbirth and afterbirth plus the complete experience .
the binding of isaac rebirth is a procedurally generated roguelike game .
you start in the basement with nothing and you must make your way through battling hordes of enemies and getting new items to get more powerful maybe powerful enough to take satan himself on .
the game even though is roguelike it keeps track of your success and the more you play the more items and unlocks you get to make your runs even more fun .
more floors get unlocked more bosses and enemies as you try to get one of the many many endings and survive the nightmare .
i 've been a huge fan of the original binding of isaac the flashgame that made it 's debut on newgrounds some years ago .
it 's twisted it 's sadistic but overall the game it 's fun .
i 've been watching isaac videos since rebirth came out and it 's dlcs only made it better adding even more items and enemies to the mix .
watching hutts and northernlion or even tearofgrace play through the daily challanges trying to unlock everything made me want to try it finally for myself but the bad thing is..
i 'm a student in argentina im only 19 years old and i 'm still looking for a job which is hard enough by itself but i handle myself doing little stuff and always when i get close to finally get the money for this amazing game something needs my money first and its usually more important than a simple game '' .
i finally got the mone oh wait i need to pay school .
oh wait i need to help with the food '' also here in argentina the prices are a little bit to high..
i can buy at least a month worth of food for home with that so i ca n't really buy it myself and even though i do n't really like the idea of asking for it i decided to finally give it a try.. !
sorry if my english its not perfect i 'm still trying to perfect it !
i 've wanted one for such a long time and i finally worked up the courage to do it .
i was a little nervous about how it looked but then i showed it to my fwb and her wife and they both literally okay not literally literally melted in a puddle .
and that was just such a confidence boost and i 'm just so happy to be involved with two amazing woman and just eeeeee .
queer womanhood is just so 3 i would n't trade it for anything in the world .
the sideshave in question https i.imgur.com/gmipaom.png please excuse the derpy expression
i feel so much more pretty and confident and happy and attractive ever since i got it .
i am not particularly proud or shameful of ottoman history but there are certain periods of our shared past that i 'm interested in one of those is the siege of plevna which i 'm pretty sure many of you heard before .
the chant that 's been written for that battle and osman paşa has always been one of my favourite songs or whatever you 'd like to call it and i generally listen to its turkish armed forces philharmonic orchestra version .
today after listening to this i encountered the bosnian version of the march .
which i believe was talking about a love in which the same osman paşa was involved and how he lost both the war and his love .
but upon reading the lyrics on the internet i think the translation from bosnian to english was a bit off some parts did n't really make sense or sound well translated .
i 'd be really happy if someone could translate it in a better way .
thanks in advance with love from your turkish brother .
i 'm reading through lawrence block books at the moment
burglar books are great only problem is i have 2 left
only read two scudder books so far but they are good although a little bit too dark/serious .
i also read the hot rock by donald westlake it was great problem is it 's really hard to find used copies of the other books with reasonable shipping to europe i usually order from awesomebooks .
male main character not too old witty a fast paced light hearted story preferably told in first person by the main character .
i was thinking about picking up some adventure books something like indiana jones maybe with puzzles and stuff know any ?
i 'm moving from taiwan to shanghai at the end of the month .

i think google needs to rethink the way assistant home thinks about multiple room setups as the current implementation is very counterintuitive .
here 's some background to my setup i live in a shared flat with three other friends .
we have philips hue lights in my bedroom my friend b 's bedroom the living room and the hallway .
we have google home minis in the living room kitchen my bedroom and b 's bedroom .
assistant home currently controls everything with a command by default .
for example if i walk into my bedroom and say lights on it turns on every light in the flat including those in b 's bedroom which has caused many issues if i try to control my lights when he 's asleep .
likewise the rooms are named b 's bedroom and c 's bedroom the latter being me .
if i say turn my bedroom lights on it turns on all lights in all rooms with bedroom in it so lights in both our rooms .
likewise if i 'm in my room and say dim the lights it will dim my lights but also turn on all lights through the rest of the flat and dim those .
you can already assign a google home to a room so surely it would make sense to have that google home control by default only the things in that room .
this would mean i could walk into the living room and say lights on and just the living room lights would come on .
or turn the lights red dim the lights and it would do so only in that room .
if i wanted to control lights in other rooms i could simply add the room name in .
so for example tell the kitchen google home to turn on the living room lights .
bonus option google could also make it easier on people who share flats by allowing you to specify which is your bedroom specifically .
so for example be able to tag c 's bedroom as being specifically my room .
that way i could say turn on my bedroom lights to specifically turn on the lights in that room .
edit just wanted to add you can kind of get round the problem using assistant 's shortcuts e.g .
tell assistant when i say lights on '' it should do turn on the lights in c 's bedroom '' .
however this still is n't ideal as you ca n't code for every possible phrase someone can say .
for example i said lights off '' the other day at 2am but assistant heard lights up '' instead and then turned on all the lights in the flat and brightened them waking up my flatmate .
it also means if a guest says lights on '' to our living room google home it uses my account shortcuts by default and turns on my bedroom lights

without getting too specific i met a girl about three months ago and have become good friends with her .
the short and narrow of it is that i 've fallen in love with her .
i fault myself for falling so fast but i 've never been so in love with someone before and without any deep backstory that 's saying a lot coming from me .
the problem being that there is another man that she 's in love with .
while they are n't quite in a relationship they have both expressed that they have feelings for each other .
she has complained about some things regarding the other man from time to time but i do believe she does love him .
would it be wrong of me to tell her how i feel at some point assuming their relationship does n't progress ?
or is her love for the other man something i have to wait for to die before i tell her ?
i feel like at some point hiding my feelings makes me a bad friend like i am withholding something from her .

hello to the friendliest people in the midwest and probably the world !
i 've realized that college is n't the place for me right now so i 'll be moving to marquette soon to live and work with my uncle until the forseeable future .
i 've visited a few times in the past and spent two weeks the most amount of time this past summer and absolutely fell in love it was the first time i visited somewhere i could see myself living in the future .
i do n't know anyone in marquette aside from my aunt and uncle and would like to know some good ways to get myself out there and meet people .
what are some community events to sign up for ?
are there animal shelters/soup kitchens/any charity opportunities to volunteer through ?
i 'm an introverted person but i want to put myself out there and try to meet people and keep myself busy so any and all things you can recommend to help me meet more friendly yoopers and hopefully become one myself are greatly appreciated !
edit sorry for the longwinded post and thanks to anyone who takes the time to read/respond !
i 'm the wednesday closer for our town 's pominos .
well we have this paper factory in town which is also a reject farm because the only people that get jobs there are heroine addicts and people looking for a job to get fired from so they can go back to collecting unemployment .
it just so happens that at least one person from said paper factory needs fucking pominos every wednesday because they ca n't be bothered to pack a sandwich .
so this last wednesday i get an order there and i know the stiff is coming .
problem is this is my third stiff in a row .
i 'm already in a pretty bad mood and when i get there this fucking idiot makes me wait a few minutes then comes dancing along picks up his half off pizzas and writes a huge line through the tip on the receipt .
then with a smile he says have a good night . ''
so i walk away then turn around and flip him off .
he did n't see me but his co-workers did and at this point i 'm just so pissed so i point directly to him and flip him off again ensuring they realize he stiffed me .
needless to say he was n't happy when he found out .
i know i should n't have done it and i definitely do regret it but sometimes you 've just had all you can take .
my life and my wages suck enough without this tool bag jovially declaring i 'm not worth a single dime .
long story short got knocked up by my overly religious rebound in a red state with a short abortion window found out too late i was taking bc got married knew from the beginning this wasnt going to end faithfully he had omitted lots of personal/financial information from me understandably we were just fwb 95 of the 3 years of 'dating ' 3 years married .
i am naturally an open lover and very promiscuous by nature .
i never liked having boyfriends i never liked being tied down .
but then our kid s 2 total turned out to have special needs .
an already fragile boat with no compass and 2 completely opposite people our kids need the stability and we are great parents together .
just a huge lack of depth lack of emotional connection no stimulating conversations very vanilla sex but it was enough very close mindedness opinions just literally what i wanted my rebound man to be a hott guy who fucks no words needed .
but i met my still single ap 3 years ago i swear i would have married him if he asked but i was just too stubborn for 'monogamy ' he 's warm and compassionate and funny and has dimples and has a massive cock and gives amazing oral something i can count on 1 hand that h has done sends me cute texts and remembers songs/dates when we 're together is perfect at keeping distance but sends me enough pictures/gifts i 've only seen him 4 times this whole year ! ! ! .
this holiday season has wrecked me since we usually see each other on our sexiversary all i have are phone calls and all i want is to be used like a cum slut and treated like queen thats he 's perfected so well with me .
i get jealous that he sometimes dates other women but he always comes back to me he 's the tyler to my marla we fit in this chaotic world together .
he understands my situation and wants a future for us and my kids but knows how i feel about family stability ap and i are broken homes and h has married parents who dont sleep in the same bed and cant stand each other so really which 1 is better ? ?
smh he 's giving us 2 more years til he gives up for good '' lol whatever that means and i love that he respects me and my children .
i used to crash at his place with my newborn when h was out of town for weeklong musical festivals ap has done above and beyond the few times i see him than a months worth of gently nagging at h. i do n't want fancy dates or movies .
i want experiences and kinky sex and sarcastic jokes .
i 'm tired of suburbia and hate what this marriage is making me a zombie cleaning sex machine .
i just need encouragement to keep ap going i used to just have flings here and there before/after marriage .
but i 've dropped it down to just my 1 ap .
tomorrow night i 'm expecting to see him fingers crossed ! ! !
you better believe i 'm going to ride him til i ca n't move from cuming so hard got ta make up for lost time
for the past few weeks my ping and latency has been an issue .
i use to play the game rather fluidly now lag is ruining the game .
i just played through the beta and i 'd love to hear your thoughts .
what did you like and what do you think needs to be improved before release ?
personally i hope they work on their hit boxes a little as i felt like a spent a lot of time getting flung around for no reason .
i loved the taste i got and ca n't wait for more .
just wondering a few things about starting a new game in monokuma 's test !
i know i 'll lose the gear and equipment but do i lose their levels and rarities as well ?
does resetting cause the pull rates of the death card machine to reset ?
i 'm wondering because i 'd love to do rerolls '' to try and get a u rarity of some characters i like .
it does n't take all that long to clear through the first 50 levels of the mode if my level 99 u rarity characters live through a reset .
prediction is it will reach till 8k by sunday evening 6:00 est time zone of usa .
should i push everything to ultra with vsync off ?
my gpu is a sapphire rx 480 8gb nitro .
so i was wondering if any of you wonderful self published authors have ever done a book tour for a book you self published ?
to start i 'm lvl 500 and have acquired all the reds and trinkets in the game after hundreds of hours .
i 've found the rng system to be pretty frustrating .
sometimes you can get the weapons you want kind of fast but sometimes it 's just so much grinding hoping you either get the drop or hoping for a roll with the right stats.it would be better if you could just get the weapon you want and pay for it .
the fun of the game comes from the challenge and trying new weapons combinations and traits .
not by sitting at a shrine hoping for what you want .
my thoughts are that missions should pay out gold and there should be an item shop that expands as you beat the game on different difficulties .
it would be nice if missions pay out different amounts of gold based on the difficulty .
these missions would have a bonus system that would reward players for doing things that helped team members like pushing gutter runners off a teammate and penalties for taking excessive damage resulting in death or requiring lots of healing items .
i was prescribed 6mg xanax and i didnt really like the way it made me feel so i saw my doctor and he prescribed me 4mg klonopin but that was not helping my anxiety so i went along and took 6mg and found its the perfect match for me to last throughout the day and through work .
i dont feel high i just feel like this is what the xanax shoudve been doing in the beginning is this a normal transition for someone whos been on 6mg xanax for awhile because i am making an appointment for the end of the week and telling him i need my dose raised to 6mg what do ya 'll think with these two drugs experience .
i just posted this to r/technology too but i think this may be a helpful subreddit for my issue .
a little over a year ago i was the victim of a violent rape .
after the fact i had taken photos of the bruising etc that had resulted on many parts of my body as well as text messages from the other party admitting assault .
a few months ago i decided that since i had decided never to pursue legal action that i no longer wanted that disturbing stuff anymore because i wanted to sort of have a fresh start on my phone and in my life .
however i am starting to regret doing so mostly out of fear that i might need this evidence in the future if i ever decide to do anything about it or in case something happens i do n't know what just scared and i might need it .
the photos have been permanently deleted from my phone .
how would i go about recovering them does apple store it 's users ' photos and if so for how long ?
how do i go about contacting apple to recover the photos ?
do i need a lawyer to do this for me ?
will this result in any kind of legal action if i do this ?
i want legal action to be taken on my terms not if it just happens automatically by me reaching out to apple or a lawyer .
is doing story quest the only real easy to do this ?
i would love to hear your thoughts/experiences on something ...
however what 's not regular is my spotting between periods .
i consistently start spotting anywhere from 10 to 5 days before af arrives .
this has been the norm for me for years .
about 6 months ago my obgyn prescribed me 200 mg oral progesterone tablets to take from cd 15-28 to try and stop the spotting .
i continued to start spotting and continue spotting until af officially arrived .
i took letrozole for 5 days and had 3 follies develop and release .
they tested my blood and said i ovulated and scheduled iui for the next day .
hubby provided 8 mil swimmers and we were off to the races.
re asked me not to take oral progesterone prescribed bc they wanted to test for themselves .
went for a progesterone test a week later and i tested low .
they put me on suppository progesterone 100 mg twice a day .
i started spotting like usual 6 days before my scheduled period and spotting for 3 days and then it stopped ... and it has n't started again ...
i was taking the same dose for months however orally and not vaginally and it never affected me .
do you think that the vaginal suppository could really make that big of a difference ?
it 's been 19 long months and i am absolutely terrified of getting my hopes up .
i 'm using poolmining.org for vertcoin and have a gtx 1060 getting 20mh .
i have 386 shares and still have 0 vertcoins suggestions ?
just dear fucking god watching collin farrel perform as grindleward/graves is still one of the most amazing performances i have seen in years for a villain with such charisma and charm to his name .
when i saw the reveal that the real '' grindleward was johnny depp it felt like such a cop out compared to just keeping farrel on and alter his appearance with slight make up adjustments and what ever post processing stuff would give him less of a graves and more of a grindlewald look .
i know jk defends the casting intensely but depp feels like he 's going to be an eye sore as grindleward hell you look at the promo shot http cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2017/11/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-cast.jpg for crimes of grindleward and he stands out in such a painful fashion compared to the rest .
i feel like depp is just there for the sake of a big name '' hell jude law feels perfectly in place and he 's a big name as well .
i just dont see depp out doing farrel at all given his recent dry streak '' with his latest movies it would make more sense to keep farrel on .
the only redeeming factor i can see with depp is maybe the rage factor but aside from that it just seems like it 'll be a total bad casting choice .
after the recent update with clip studio i 've been having this minor problem with the wacom pen side switch .
personally i set my buttons to pan and move and when i flip to the eraser tool the shortcuts would work .
now when i use my eraser i can not use the pen 's side switch .
it 's become really annoying and it 's hindering my workflow .
i only got 4 10 games won in placement even tho i won 6 of them .

ever since crisis on earth x ended i 've wanted supergirl to crossover on arrow or the flash and now that we 've gotten the news that starting in february supergirl will have a 9 week hiatus which is a long time .
i think this is the perfect chance for her to go have a crossover some time within those 9 weeks with one or even 2 of the shows .
yes i get that crossovers cost a lot in the budget but it does n't have to be a gigantic super epic crossover episode s but still just something .
so who else wants her to have a crossover ?

i have 2x4gb of 3000mhz lpx vengeance ram a asus prime b350 plus motherboard ryzen 5 1600 600b evga powersupply and a aorus rx 580 .
basically i realized that when i built my new pc and booted it up my ram was clocked at 2133mhz instead of 2933mhz or 2666mhz .
so i opened up the bios and used the d.o.c.p profile and it worked fine .
the next day i booted up my pc but it went into a boot-loop until i set the profile to auto '' .
how do i get my ram to 2933mhz or 2666mhz and will using d.o.c.p brick my board also i do n't have the latest bios as i do n't know how to install it but i have the bios provided by the cd from the motherboard .
we have just released a new film which contains an exclusive interview wit george efsathiou who was the scientist chosen by esa to present the cosmology results for their planck spacecraft .
we asked if the data results favour models of inflationary cosmology that are of the eternal inflation type and therefore a multiverse .
he answered very strongly in the affirmative and even said it was the most important result from planck .
so it 's common sense '' that bitcoingold is a scam ... or so i 've been told .
that is quite disheartening since i just bought a large amount of it .
bitcoingold has just been featured on bittrex which is supposedly a reputable trading platform .
could that prove that bitcoingold is not a scam ?
if bitcoingold is a scam how could it survive for so long since some people have made profit from it .
do they just dissapear with all of the coins ?
would you be so kind as to do a little eli5 here
i 've made quite a profit from it should i bail out immediately ?
since all the allegations i could find are months old .
ps i 've been mining eth for a while but i 'm a complete newbie in the trading community .
i 'm eyeballing to transfer everything to iota soon .
not sure if anyone else noticed this but me and my brothers were all forgetting to sharpen our weapons constantly because they removed the pop-up dialog for weapon power has decreased '' like in the older games when your sharpness decreases .
i do n't find this to be a big deal that it was removed but for all the qol changes they have put it removing this pop-up seem like a weird thing to do imo .
does anyone else feel the same way about this or do you think the new progress bar that shows your decreasing sharpness is enough to remind you when you need to pull out that whetstone ?
i 'd love to know what other people think .
which 3 will be the icons for next week ?
i recently decided i want a complete career change .
i had a steady job in advertising but then got made redundant and have been out of work for most of the year .
i have decided i want to become a photographer focusing on live music photography .
which is scary because i feel like i 'm throwing away my previous experience in a stable job/industry and will have to study again .
i do n't even know if i 'll be any good .
i have found a course i want to do but i need a laptop and i do n't have one .
i will also need to purchase a proper slr camera at some point .
i also need to figure out how to make money on the days i am not studying .
i have installed my cookbook and have read quite a lot about paprika as well .
the problem with mycookbook is that it does not convert units found in a recipe .
i know i can do this easily myself but i would like my app to this for me .
does paprika or another app convert units in my case to metric
after the enthusiasm that came from finishing the story and after disappointment that came from missing r/anime rewatch of spice and wolf i got an idea to see if we could do something similar with the novels .
not only would we be able to discuss the story up to and past volume 5 book by book this would also be a great chance to give people who have only seen the anime a better opportunity to dive deeper into the story .
while i would like to mainly follow the continuity of the novels i would like to occasionally also get manga involved in the discussion since it manages to follow the novels fairly well and should soon be nearing the conclusion of the story .
warning covers of volume 17 and 18 contain spoilers of the ultimate conclusion of the story although if you 've managed to avoid it up until now you are certainly in an enviable position .
if there is a better legal source let me know and i will gladly edit it in .
my plan is to schedule each novel one week apart from the previous one which should give everyone plenty enough time to finish them although to create the entire schedule half a year ahead of time would be far too optimistic .
there might also be slight alterations to this format like short stories from volume 7 being assigned to other volumes or the two volume stories being joined into one two weeks long interval .

i hope you 'll enjoy this enough for us to reach the end of the series together and maybe even enough to make this an annual event .
also special thanks to u/mpp00 whose format i 'm shamelessly stealing .
dec update i was initially intending to spread out only side stories from vol .
7 since they can be easily placed earlier into the story however from my own experience a volume full of nothing but side stories can be difficult to digest especially once the main story starts picking up .
while most side stories ca n't be so easily placed chronologically some of them can still be placed by relevance especially stories flashing out important secondary characters .
others i will have to spread out more or less randomly although i 'll try to keep side stories from one volume closer together when possible .
my logic for splitting it was that that since the conclusion is fairly short it would go nicely with the coin of the sun but it 's not that short and it 's already a two volume story discussion that week so i 've changed my mind .
hi after purchasing a large dark angels army the reviews are leaving me a tiny bit salty .
if i painted my models as a diy chapter can i use them in tournaments as ultramarines for ex ?
so let 's say my chapter the crimson swords with red power armour and a white winged sword chapter symbol could be run as ultramarines with an appropriately painted guilleman ?
i am newly back to competitive 40k last doing an event at the start of 5th so am unsure what the ruling would be nowadays !
my first event is london gt in may so need to get painting whichever way !
if anyone has any experience in this regard please let me know !
they throw out a nuance which we do n't get .
the more evil ones will use it to gain social status by making us look bad or mocking us in front of others .
ive been using db for a couple hours now and still havent gotten a mount with them .
i cant figure out if they removed the mounting damage or ive just been unlucky .
if you 'll humor me i 'd like to get some second opinions on something i 've been thinking about .
i 've been playing with the idea of getting a shotgun for a little while but i keep thinking that they 're obsolete in today 's firearm industry .
intended use personal defense out to 50 yards past that i have a selection of carbines to use
reloads extremely quick and ammo can be easily carried en masse .
hollow points prevent over penetration and still pack a wallop .
uses same hollow points and in some cases magazines as handguns .
have shotguns been made obsolete by modern carbines and hand guns ?
earlier today my family and i were talking about what types of chips we like the brand good 's have red and blue bags of chips .
and my mother and sister said they like the blue ones and my father said he likes the red ones and i said i like both . ''
they do n't even know i 'm bisexual in anyway but i think it 's so funny to subtly come out every now and then .
i just started chapter 2 and i got my initiation cerimony at the tavern .
bunch of npcs came all wearing ring of water armor i started dialogue with lares completing the quest and getting my own armor .
after that everyone returned to their regular but only some of the members left cavalorn gaan and someone else while lares martin and others remained in their meeting cutscene '' pose .
talking with them leads to generic welcome greetings while lares himself told me we 'd talk again at the usual place at the harbor they do n't seem to want to leave and go back to their regular places though even after sleeping in the tavern .
i 'm a bit worried i might have encountered a bug are they supposed to stay stuck in place a little bit longer ?
i have decided to diversify my crypto portfolio maybe put a little into the top 20 and i was wondering where is the best exchange to do this and the best place to store it .
i have a ledger wallet but i know that does n't support many of the alt coins out there .
is it reliable/okay to use elements from your supplement questions if not the same thing in another school 's application supplement ?
especially if it 's creative and portrays you quite well .
just made new barb anyone available to rush me to 70 real quick ?
i 've gotten around 4 wins today and none of them have went towards my stats.. i️ thought they fixed this ?
i 've had so much fun with you all over the past year or so that i 've decided to finally start making posts of my own !
as i mentioned i 've been roleplaying for a while now not to mention being an amateur writer having posted no r/nosleep a few times with varying degrees of success .
so i 'm a huge stickler for grammar presentation and a general attention to detail that seems to be lacking in so many potential partners .
i write in first person – present tense and would prefer if you did the same however this has proven to be somewhat non-essential in the past so i 'm flexible on a partner 's writing style .
so my name is alex i 'm a guy in his late 20 's from the united kingdom .
i have short usually shaven brown hair pale blue eyes with quite a small snub nose not to mention a lot of dense black stubble .
despite being a little pale i 'm pretty athletic working out daily to keep myself toned and healthy all that good stuff .
but do n't get too excited ‘cause i 'm a very mediocre 5'8 so if you like tall guys i 'm probably not for you .
i 've made one of those handy kinklists https i.imgur.com/qpgq3a0.png so you can see just what i 'm into but do n't go thinking they 're set in stone .
like a lot of you what i 'm in the mood for varies on a daily basis but i can safely say there are one or two that are total achilles ' heels for me .
one is anal the other being interracial if i 'm sent anything that involves either of those know that i 'll just melt into the keyboard after replying immediately .
if you 're an ethnic girl who 's down for anal be careful i might spontaneously combust with excitement and you do not want that on your conscience .
in terms of scenes i 'm open to all kinds of scenarios from short and sweet to long-term d'n 'd style adventures .
but here 's a few to get the ball rolling just ideas to brainstorm with really so i 'm open to twists and interpretations
– we 've been platonic friends for a while now helping each other recover from the odd tough break up getting high and binge watching boxsets of true detective and other hbo programming .
but one night we happen to discover a mutual kink for something oh so taboo anal sex .
after discussing what we love about it the general consensus is what 's a little anal sex between friends ?
cocaine and cock – sex and drugs they go together like milk and cereal right ?
cocaine mdma strong sticky cannabis they all make sex feel that little bit more amazing .
so i 'd love to play something out that included oodles of drug taking whether it be at a party me playing your dealer or whatever we might come up with that has us fucking like rabbits whilst snorting off of each other 's bodies .
humanxanthro/monster interracial okay so aside from normal interracial fantasy interracial has to be one of my biggest kinks right now .
any scenario in which i get to have my way with and elf orc catgirl or monstergirl is one that is bound to be a huge hit with me .
so if you like playing as someone or something a little more mythical do n't be afraid to ask i 'll fall over myself to get something going on the subject .
la cuisine derriere – this last one is not for the faint of heart only true buttsluts will find this even remotely appealing .
as the title implies this is a lot about food-play and less about scat everything in the scene will be sterilized and clean .
i suppose we can discuss it more if you 're interested so i 'll keep this brief .
i should add that i do prefer google docs as my preferred medium for roleplay give how many cool little features it has .
i do n't do kik or anything like that i 'd rather write than just cyber as its much more gratifying .
that being said if we do end up sticking to reddit my reply times is usually 5-10 minutes averaging about two or three paragraphs depending on what 's called for in the scene at that moment .
aaaanyway looking forward to hear back from all you deliciously perverted ladies and girls do n't hesitate to drop me a line any time of day i 'll reply as soon as possible .
the shepherd/farmer from ep.3 quotes a bible verse mark 13:33 that he apparently got from the new priest '' .
the whole chapter of mark 13 is very creepy because it addresses end time and false prophets .
what 's really troubling about this is the chapter talks about false prophets who could be noah but because noah speaks about this at the parish where the farmer got it from the false prophets could be jonas and claudia that he 's supposedly calling out .
i recently tried to boot my arch linux with this kernel parameter to try fix a unrelated problem i had but now when i shutdown my computer using the power button the dell logo flashes really fast and i get a black screen grub is running on the other side cause i can still boot into my windows pressing down 2 times i can not get into the bios .
after a while it boots up on my arch where everything is normal .

this has to have been posted before as it is a common issue .
i am on anti-depressants for anxiety and severe depression but it lowers my already low libido .
i have low testosterone and with the anti-depressants it makes it tough to want sex or get off .
i can get an erection easily just do n't want sex .
wondering if there was anyone that had a solution to this .
my wife is the one that forced me to get back on the pills and she gets viciously angry when i do n't want sex .
i 'm only 25 years old so it sucks that this is even an issue .

when you 're walking on a beach say you look down for 5 minutes on a 6 minute walk .
suppose there 's small rocks and shells everywhere not just sand .
statistically how many rare rocks shells worth over 50 will likely cross your peripherals regardless if you notice it or not ?
i know price is subjective but you know what i mean ... a rock that can be worth 500 vs 5000 ?
well its still over 50 for sure you know ?
have rlm ever mentioned their thoughts on this 'wave ' of movies and would they ever do a review or hitb on one ?
well then yeah if you did something on purpose which placed your unborn child in danger you could theoretically be charged .
it would n't be something like driving a car swimming skydiving etc .
it would have to be more severe like doing hard drugs full-contact mma while you know you 're pregnant or something like that .
basically there are already rules and laws for what constitutes negligence .
well at least he did n't spell anything wrong this time .
i think the amount of content in fifa has always increased think about how many new things have been introduced in a few years .
i just think better game play and more regular patches to fix bugs which a team will be able to focus on would be a benefit .
i understand why fix fifa may scare ea but right now they 're in damage limitation after the battlefront scandal and if they can find a way to charge you £6/7 pound a month that 's £72-£84 which is more than the majority of people spend on the game .
i was originally planning on mentioning random people/things in this arc and asking is this the chimera ant ? ''
but they revealed them in the first ten minutes so now my plan has been foiled .
the kids did their dance and music classes and then we hosted my daughters bday party 2 weeks late .
her friend is sleeping over now and she is a bit of a pill .
fortunately you 're still in the audition process of the season so the staff would be well aware of your circumstances or should be if they are as focused on the educational aspect as they claim to be .
learn all the material you can in the time you 've got and let your quality shine through .
but above all else remember that a positive attitude and a willingness to learn are the traits that staff in every corps wish to see in their potential members .

some people have cried out for there to be more gender friendly genderless friendly ?
some are like you and say leave it alone .
i personally was just having a golem creation argument with a friend .
in addition to that lethality will be nerfed sorcery tree loses 3 ad and black cleaver gains 6 armor penetration .
the giant slayer lw got nerfed too so there 's less reason to build this above the anti lifesteal one .

your poor gf was likely just an all over wreck considering what happened to her the witnessing violence all while being quite drunk .
while it 's not my place to make this choice i sincerely hope once she 's able to that she presses charges .
this type of person could prey on another innocent young woman .
just because he was drunk that does n't dismiss his responsibility for his choices .
the same way a drunk driver still goes to prison for killing someone .
i also hope she seeks out counseling as well .
i 'm glad you guys are doing something relaxing for the evening that could take your minds off of all of this .

this pisses me off beyond belief not because of you but actually everyone else .
this was obviously a while back and things are very different now .
but first of all being mad at you is stupid your family has the right to not partake in something with ties to a religious thing and you were too young to understand any of that anyways .
second they were asking you to apologize for telling the truth of something not bad that 's a lot of hypocrisy and confusion for a young kid .
third the pledge thing pisses me off again different tines but where does that teacher have the gall that is out of her rights to enforce anything of that nature .

drink lots of fluids get rest take some ibuprofen or tylenol if it helps and you should be better within a week or so .
it 's subjective but that does n't mean that it ca n't be better .
it means it could be better for you and the ridiculously small sample of the magic community that you asked .
but making it better for you will make it worse for someone else who likes it the way it is or does n't like whatever is different about it .
taste is subjective and your sample size is too small to make any sort of accurate predictions about anything

by starting another convo that means yes in fact the other one indeed ended how else could this one be started ?
and stop talking about hitler so much are you off your meds ?
but since you insist on being wrong let me end this convo like the first one except this time permanently !
plutia flops onto her plushie pile and ... time skippy to leaving for gate 3 ?
would n't they still have bluetooth interference issues even if it 's a scuf ?
there 's a simple reason why people working on ai will rarely warn about ai .
it 's their livelihood warning about it hurts their freedom to work and ability to get funding .
ah yes the libertarian small-government free market position that supports the government conducting violent raids of people 's homes to forcibly remove them from the country .
so pretty much it is illegal for them to deduct money from my paycheck to recoup costs .
what kind of lawyer would i contact for such claims ?
all of this started because netflix did n't want to be owned by disney .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again one company having such large buying power in the market is bad for everyone bad for theatre owners bad for the consumer and especially bad for the buying power a film crew/actor/actress will have in the industry .
there are a ton of induction friendly griddles out there .
i do n't like nicklebacks music and would n't have much opinion on them if i did n't hear an interview with them when i was a kid .
this was when they had just started to become mainstream popular and said something along the lines of teenage girls come to our concerts thinking it 's all gon na be what they hear on the radio but then they are surprised to hear that we are hard rockers '' and that they thought it was funny .
i think photograph is funny but not because it 's supposed to be but a line in the song is what the hell was on joey 's head .
i agree with you and the other guy on the subject .
batman is bruce wayne clark kent is superman etc .
i was just wondering if he felt in a situation where bruce is more permanently sidelined but still around .
well it 's not taken yet so i guess i 'll take it
went to a party last night at an art museum and approached a super hot girl .
we hit it off and she 's going on a date with me monday .
so i space out for a bit not thinking about it and then all of a sudden it hits me that i 'm going on a date in the next few days and i get this sense of dread .
i just love getting caught at the edge of it and losing half my health as a squishy .
that 'll depend on whether or not smoking anything inside a commercial establishment is legal .
smoking cigarettes in bars/restaurants has been illegal in my city for 10 years .
hookha bars have been illegal for a couple years now too .
i think maybe the fruit only stuff is allowed but i might be mistaken
when everlasting is used in the context of its subject .
iv giving you scriptural proof many scriptures that are showing you how everlasting '' or eternal '' do not always mean never ending .
jude 7 says that sodom and gomorrah suffered the vengeance of eternal fire . ''
peter said that that fire turned those cities into ashes condemning them to destruction 2 peter 2:6 .
the eternal '' fire burned until there was nothing left to burn and then it went out see also jer .
scripture 's description of god 's punishment of edom yields a good example of this usage forever and ever . ''
isaiah says that god would turn that country into burning pitch that would not be quenched night or day '' and that its smoke was to ascend forever .
from generation to generation it shall lie waste no one shall pass through it forever and ever '' isa .
edom was destroyed but it is not still burning .
the forever '' lasted until its destruction was complete .
the old testament says that a slave could serve his master forever '' ex .
21:6 that the child samuel was to abide in the tabernacle forever '' 1 sam .
1:22 and that jonah thought he would be in the belly of the great fish forever '' jonah 2:6 .
the new testament uses this term in a similar way paul for example counseled philemon to receive onesimus forever '' philemon 15 .
in all these instances forever '' means as long as the person lives . ''
if you know of course do n't expect you to have played a whole bunch at that cost

you 're saying that they do n't know the real you because they do n't know your diagnosis .
they probably know a lot about you if they consider you to be their friend .
i 'm not saying to hide your diagnosis forever but i 'm not sure why you 're so eager to do it .
its there for pacing and to punish overdraw/resource managment .
its a legitimate feature and the game would be worse without it
when my grandma was diagnosed with cancer i looked into cbd oil .
it actually interferes with a lot of medication by binding to the receptors that the prescribed medicine is supposed to bind to .
comorbid does n't specify whether diseases are related or not .
the term can indicate either a condition existing simultaneously but independently with another condition or a related medical condition .

i 've prepped a fir to 5 star getting ready to pass a sword down but i just want to make sure .
should i refine fir 's killing edge into slaying edge then pass the slaying edge over to ayra ?
or can i just pass killing edge over to ayra and have ayra refine it to slaying edge then slaying edge ?

so you decided to whine about the ‘injustice ' of having your ‘free speech restricted ' to a bunch of unrelated strangers instead of just simply pming the mods or i do n't know apologizing for your mistake to give you the benefit of the doubt and refraining from making jokes about sensitive subjects .
you are the true model of maturity for our generation s
also and i truly see the irony in this i 've noticed that you use the word ‘retarded ' in some of your more ... colorful comments .
the word ‘retarded ' is an admittedly outdated medical term and has actually become a slur against disabled people .

it 's not okay to argue for special privilege and treatment because you believe you are owed one .

freedom of speech ends when there are rules about what you can and can not say .

i think what you 're doing is called moving goalposts .
or maybe there 's a better catch-all fallacy for being bad at arguing in general ?
i am assuming you did n't even read my comment because you have somehow already established a habit of downvoting without responding asserting unsubstantiated claims as fact and generally being unproductive and unpleasant to discuss worm with .
so let me give that fairly concise comment i made a tl dr
the trump '' classification is not limited to those who only interfere with other powers wog .
but they arent monty so stop expecting monty quality work from people who arent monty .
unless there is something to set them apart e.g .
yup if you are channeling the nunu ult and you get taunted while channeling the ult one-shots everyone in its range .
it 's a bug that 's been around for a few patches now
i think i disagee with most points here though .
buckle up we 're in for a wall of text .
for efficiency all of these web languages are going to need to be downloaded interpreted and displayed by the browser .
scripting languages are just not as fast and efficient as precompiled binaries .
it 's not difficult but multithreading also needs a bit more planning in a browser based web app .
are less readable than modern languages like swift or my current favorite kotlin .
debugging yours or someone else 's code just sucks .
it 's a bias of mine but trying to debug web apps 24/7 is what i imagine one of the circles of hell to be like .
on better hooks into the system i 'm speaking more of api 's and lower level hooks into the system .
for example if i want my app to do something at a specific time or after a specific event like when the phone is charging i can schedule that out .
i do n't think there are common web api 's to accomplish this .
api 's can certainly be built to duplicate existing functionality but what exactly is the benefit there ?
part of the attraction of web apps are that they 're more-or-less universal when done right .
but if apple has certain api 's for doing something google has their own api 's for doing it microsoft does n't support it at all and firefox can support it but not by default for privacy reasons or something your code is going to have to have a bunch of checks to see what it can do and that sucks if it 's a required part of your app .
oh yeah and unless you stick it behind a php or similar gatekeeper page to determine the client environment and deliver the appropriate code your users are all going to be downloading extra code their browser wo n't interpret since it is n't for their platform .
lastly it is harder to reverse engineer binaries than source code .
in a browser they can typically view the source code in 2 or 3 clicks and see how your app works unless you fed your js through an obfuscation utility .
decompiling binaries requires a bit more effort and is n't perfect .
most of the time the code is still hard to read .
for why most devs would care about such things they would n't .
but some devs do want to keep certain parts of their app secret if they can for security purposes .
i too share your hatred of web apps obviously .
i see it as what am i giving up and what am i gaining by switching from native to web programming ? from my perspective it looks like i 'm giving up a lot of luxuries and what i 'm getting in return is just a unified code base but a unified code base that 's primitive and the least common denominator for all my target platforms .
i 'll happily stick with the extra work of porting my code to other platforms if i need to .
at 16:20 i 'm on mobile do n't know how to timestamp there .
thanks for confirming that you are a jerk and a self centered asshole .
no need to cheat as other has suggested i 've made a video tutorial about it you can see it here .
if it does n't help and you still need assistance and you 're on pc add me and contact me about it here .
but if you 're not then the only thing i can say is that it 's not impossible you need to practice and you 'll definitely get it .
just do n't expect to finish it in a few tries it is really difficult but only in the beginning although it 's absolutely possible as you play eventually you 'll memorize every shortest route which is what it 's all about .
when your team is behind catching someone out of position and making it a 4v5 can really turn a game around .
that 's why i prefer to be the engage so i have to rely less on my team to do that .
also with the short cooldowns you can still peel after the engage .
i know what you 're trying to say and i would agree that it 's good to stay in touch with what your competitors are doing but i do n't think that call of duty and overwatch are direct competitors especially overwatch .
the only common ground the two games have is being a first person shooter and team based play and even that is scaled down as much as 8 times .
battlefield has mostly stayed battlefield for the longest time and yes it has spread it 's wings to be like other games but it always comes back to basic conquest and large scale team oriented objective based game play whether or not they do it well in some versions this is what bf players play the game for .
sure invite a cod player to playtest for bf but if their feedback resembles something like not enough 360 no scopes needs more arena style matches just wanted to kill people and did n't care about capturing flags '' i would hope that they mostly ignore that feedback and if they do consider it for the sake of catering to them they should put very minimal effort into it or just make a different game under a different name .
most of my friends who used to be dedicated bf players dropped off after bf4 because they felt it was getting too wacky .
i wish they 'd come to bf1 because i think it 's much improved over it 's predecessors but it seems as if they 've given up on the franchise because they just ca n't keep it consistent to what they love about it .
now if they were to take equal players from arma and squad as they do with cod and overwatch then that would be much more applicable because bf is a middle ground .
to pull feedback from one side of the spectrum would be downright idiotic .
i can not be the only one who honesty believed hrc was going to win with a healthy lead .
during the weeks and months leading up trump continued to shove both feet down his throat and quite frankly and imo was both unqualified and completely unsuitable to become the next potus .
so many msm and pop-culture '' orgs talking to you snl were selling the inevitable hrc victor that i began to believe my vote did n't matter .
to a certain degree this rather irked me a bit .
while i never believed trump should win i also felt hrc was being ram-rodded down our throats by the dnc and the nomination process was at best window dressing .
sanders upset the proverbial apple cart by refusing to play ball and the dnc was forced to pay lip service .
while imo a qualified experienced candidate who could have neutrilzed many of trump 's bs was ignored .
i have no problems with openly admitting i wrote in my protest vote '' for senator jim webb .
i performed extensive due diligence on his past policy decisions and stance on issues and felt he 'd have made a superior potus when compared to other candidates .
obviously no candidate is perfect and a certain amount of personal compromise/weighing out on various issues is required .
yet compared with the competition i wish he 'd been given a fair shake and not simply thrown out by the dnc as a sacrificial lamb for the sake of appearance .

this is the guilio cesare we 're talking about though .
you know the only bb with more than 8 guns to have higher-than-normal sigma until t8 ... and wg also threw on japanese dispersion to boot .
any bb would probably have landed a few hits at that distance but cesare is as accurate as bbs higher than her normal mm spread .
i think for quality of passes accuracy brouwer has a better pass but in terms of decision making and making the smart/proper pass it 's definitely ferly .

yes it is completely possible to get shredded af naturally as a matter of fact you can even lean bulk in the shredded state and stay that way by gasp bulking slowly
you mostly hear about muscle catabolism from bodybuilders and physique athletes often in competition settings .
the reason for this is because these guys and gals have contests that they need to come in shredded for .
they have to be 5 bodyfat by that specific day that specific time or else they lose the contest to someone else .
this usually means that they do a lot of cardio and cut calories harshly so that they can prepare for the contest in time .
the 2nd reason you hear about muscle catabolism is because you are a lot smaller then you think you are when you are shredded fat makes you look fat but it also makes you look big .
most people dont have as much muscle as they think they do and it suprises them much so that they often think they lost some in the process .
they are also much lighter a 5'10 180 lb male at 15 bf will be 162 lbs at 5 .
and thats for a very well trained individual with a superior ffmi of 22 so more like 150 lbs for just your above avarage muscle dude .
in order to get shredded sucessfully as a natty there are a couple bullet points i want to throw out there off the top of my head
cut slowly at and below 10 for reference it means that once your trying to get your lower abs to show cut your weight loss to .7 lb per week at most
get about 1.5g/lb of protien you can probably get away with a bit less but to be safe i 'd stay around that number .
any less you risk muscle loss any more and its just unsustainable
refeed frequently at maitnence for a few days 3 is a nice number yes it means your fat loss will be even slower .
if you 're in a rush to get shredded you wont get shredded .
train with less frequency and volume but maintain/increase the intensity .
intensity depending upon where your intensity already is if you already train with intesnity leave it there if your doing 10-12 reps then move down to 5-8 .
you 'll find that people very infrequently hit all these conditions 1 and 3 specifically .
either way he still would n't have gotten it off in time .
not sure if this is meant to be a reference or something but i do wish we had a lil more customization options on old cars to make some more convincing looking gassers like this
you do n't need to understand other perspectives you idiots .

if the video is talking about black rappers literally going extinct it is factually wrong period .
this is for the other condescending asshole u/ropqor too .
just got a new timex easy reader 40th anniversary for christmas from my amazing girlfriend .
in my opinion one of the most beautiful yet simple designs i 've ever seen .
along with what 's in the picture when it is lit up the number 40 appears on the face .
it 's a nice note to the year without being tacky .
i even tried to explain to her that she ca n't have autism because she can talk but all that did was make her angry
this does n't sound like you really understand autism at all .
i heard only 25 of people in general are expected to vote there .
that 's even more reason to push for more of the democratic leaning black crowd to show up .
yeah i might have autism and i 've had to learn to kick up more fuss than i felt necessary because people would n't take me seriously unless i was being dramatic .
afaik you do n't need a visa to visit the us from korea

it really does n't hurt to add it to your portfolio even just for diversity 's sake .
with network programming i 'm much more comfortable in vb6 and can write complex stable software in it .
a 3rd party .dll handling math could be the answer .
vb6 is n't low level but all that matters is what is sent to the cpu in machine code .
async multisocket blockchain nodes running on fast dedicated servers with fast download/upload and minimum hardware specs alike could probably beat the brakes off of most distributed ledgers in terms of speed .
regardless what this event values lpl proves that they do have talents and dont need to rely on kr imports anymore .
china definetely can challenge korea if they keep trying hard this season and nurture their own talents .
yeah i sorta agree not worth the hassle better off buying like 20 of 0.7 liter bottles and you have something you can pour a full 0.5 beer out of .
while i have them 2 that i have have worked perfectly nice amount of foam ...
these sorta move part of the work from bottling part to drinking part..
i hope this post sorta serves as warning to people buying these .

when she was horny and super loaded i said no more than a few times
i can say i pondered the what ifs a bit prior to raising the dosage .
like what if the rather minor headache at 10mg increased to migraine levels at the higher dosage ?
did n't happen luckily but still was a concern .
hopefully op knows their body well enough to make a good decision for themselves .

mark my words she will be fired for saying fucking during her rant even though it 's the truth
fine i 'll say in my opinion most western women are annoying as shit .
even though me stating it is implied to be an opinion already but whatever .
you also contradict yourself by saying you know many women exactly like that but assume i must just be mistaken in my assessment of them and have minimal experience dealing with women .
i 've probably dealt with women 60-65 of my time in my life compared to 35-40 of the time with men .
i honestly am likely to be single for the rest of my life which gives me the freedom to not put up with kissing women 's asses and absorbing with their petty shit like most men do .
this is how most men talk to other men no bullshit or coddling .
i 'll assume you are not used to be spoken to like a man which is the reason you need to question my motives or insulate that i 'm wrong or need to correct my views because they dare paint women not even all women in a negative light or reduce them down to incorrect generalizations .
so i 'll say objectively i find women more annoying than men because women are rarely called out on their shit and bad behaviors particularly by men especially nowadays where the far-left will claim you to be sexist/misogynistic '' if you even do n't kiss women 's asses in the most minor of ways .
if most men were treated how society caters to and coddles and protects women i 'd probably hate everyone equally .
but since women get to get-away with being assholes more than men due to gynocentrism they are more annoying to me in the same way bad children who have parents that never discipline or scold them are .
men are currently constantly being told by the world that they 're wrong/bad in some way and need to conform to what everyone else wants while women are currently constantly being told that they 're fierce powerful and strong '' and that they can do no wrong resulting in narcissistic cunts on social media unironically describing themselves as princesses queens and goddesses . ''
not only does no one call them out on this bad behavior but the same behavior from men would make them social pariahs .
now take this one example i just gave and expand it all throughout the rest of society .
your creative skills are just complete and utter crap you know that ?

that girl was literally calling him a pedophile and said that he want 's to support childporn on twitter and she had over 2k engagements on that tweet .

its actually pretty easy to lead your shots lol ... with next to 0 its actually easy to dominate with this tank .
idk if you knoticed but flak can damage tanks an aa truck can outrange all tanks and can effectively poke the thing to death with a long stick ... and an aa truck stands for anti air so no it should n't be able to kill infantry as effective as it can with a smoke screen and sonic speeds idk what other defense you need ...
in short a tank designed for anti air is to effectively at everything not to mention that the aa trucks effective counter got nerfed into the ground and now is n't as effective '' as it once was .
id been fine with the aa truck balance if the bomber once again got buffed to recounter the aa truck the most significant change that really fucked the bombers was the aa hight increase so bombers could n't fly higher to advoid fire like a normal bomber should then there was the unnecessary buff to aa damage against the bombers nowdays bombers are rarely flown so aa trucks mostly go uncontested as it has no effective counter as such so please explain to me how a vehicle can be called balanced if its main counter got nerfed so hard its hard to call it a counter anymore ...

every scenario is different but what i mean when i say form over fixture does n't include the top 6 teams .
it 's more relevant when you have a player in mediocre form playing against a bad team and a player in good form against a team in 7th or 8th .
morata is a good example at the moment i would n't say he 's in the best form but he was up against west ham so he looked a good option .
i personally thought salah was a better option despite being up against tougher opposition .

i was at some booth at the county fair where you could have an old-timey wanted poster made up .
i grew up in gold country and knew about claim jumpers who stole gold off of other miners ' land .
i asked for my wanted poster to read gold digger .
my mom tried to persuade me to at least go for gold miner but i was adament .
needless to say '' suggests you kinda anticipated her reaction .
i came out to an old gf of mine we 'd already split and just friends and i did it really badly when i still was n't clear about my gender .
she was very hurt by that but looking back now i realise how badly i did it .
her feelings are valid because they are her feelings and whether you are nb trans cis we should n't get into shaming people for their emotions .
i know it should n't be necessary but as nb folk it 's expected of us to be educators and advocates even when our own emotions and mental state may be a shit storm .
give her a little time and ask her if she wants to say any more about her feelings and do n't shut her down .
the most important aspect of any relationship is feeling loved and she wants to know needs to know that your gender id and expression do n't negate your feelings for her .

4 people here are n't very educated/open-minded when it comes to lgbt issues .
we still have a long way to go unfortunately .
you will find teens/young adults who are open-minded regarding same-sex relationships but even they will probably be prejudiced towards transgender/genderqueer people .
also the romanian language is heavily gendered so that would probably be an issue for a genderqueer person too .

i met up with this seemingly awesome girl online .
we had been chatting for about a week or two and we shared lots of common hobbies .
the day before our date she asked if she could bring her best friend .
i had no problem with it because it was the first time we were meeting and maybe she 'd be more comfortable with her friend .
the day of she texts me asking if her friend 's boyfriend can join us as well i said sure again .
i get there and it turns out it 's a group interview for a pyramid scheme .
i mean i 'd be more irritated if i did n't have another working lebel and if i paid more than 300 but still kinda annoying since the guy who sold it did n't mention it .

he still takes great pride in his quirk but he only sees his quirk as a means to become the number one hero .
he wo n't do anything villainous even if he loses his quirk .
also we can equate students losing their quirk to effective character deaths since they 'll be forced to leave the school and become irrelevant in the plot .
when considering character deaths its important to weigh how much their death would give and take away from the story .
with bakugou he acts as both a wall and inspiration for deku and his classmates while being a character with fleshed out motivations that drive the plot along at times .
to kill '' him would effectively remove all of that while giving what in return ?
in other words bakugou has effective plot armor in this point of the story .
it just makes little sense to kill '' him when he offers so much more when he still has his quirk rather than when he is quirkless .
perhaps toga could make the attempt to remove his quirk but 5 times out of 7 she 'll fail

their spam filtering is better because they aggregate data ... what do you even mean by this ?
it 's obvious you 've never actually interacted with a homeless person btw .
if you had they would tell you that working is for suckers why work and spend all your money on rent and taxes when you can hold a cardboard sign and get your drug money tax-free ?
wait wait wait do you believe that all panhandlers are homeless ?
furthermore do you believe that they are getting by off 1-2 hours a day ?
do you know how much they actually make a day https www.snopes.com/do-panhandlers-make-50-an-hour or are you just talking out of your ass ?
and by all means do n't take my word for it .
go offer them work and see what happens like in this case
curious thing about that case there 's no corroboration as to whether the pair mentioned were actually homeless .
they also returned citing the median income of the county and how the job offered to them would n't be enough to afford even a one bedroom apartment .
there 's also another report from fox that they were arrested not for being drunk but for vagrancy and disorderly conduct .
but hey you found supposedly one report to confirm your bias therefore all panhandlers are the same .
hell you can find multiple claims to support your bias just none of them any more than a singular data point making them anecdotal evidence .
and you think i have n't interacted with a homeless person .
sneering at them through your car window does n't count as interaction buddy .
it 's people like you that got trump elected .
white male working class americans are sick to death of getting blamed for all of the worlds problems .
ironically it 's actually people like you that are the reason he got elected .
people who refuse to accept that they benefit from systemic privilege perhaps because they like you can not differentiate systemic privilege from individual privilege .
people who pretend that white males are being oppressed because they 're seeing more minorities and women ignoring that when something is unequal in your favor leveling the playing field is going to result in you seeing less of that inequality .
people like you who are narcissistic enough to believe that their success can only be attributed to their own hard work when luck plays such a clearly significant factor .
people like you who believe that white male working-class americans are being blamed for all of the world 's problems .
yeah they lashed out because they 're ignorant and perceive a personal slight where there is none because they think of themselves as disenfranchised and oppressed in stark defiance to reality .
because stations like fox pad their egos to believe such .
because they base their beliefs on prejudices and not facts as you seem to .
if you had n't claimed to have been working for twenty years i 'd assume from your posts that you 're a sheltered teenager .
instead i 'm forced to assume you 're merely an immature sheltered adult .
this is n't the way people as old as you should be making decisions .
i saw them a few years ago at download and he got a bunch of kids to come up onstage where they stood awkwardly for some time he may have got them to sing at one point before being released back into the crowd .
and he snapped at another band member while standing near the mic saying i got this '' so there was maybe some tension going on there .
it was very uncomfortable and tense and not a great performance .
it 's live now and it 's not particularly great .
but nobody knows what he looks like ... he 's probably already in the game .
keep grinding a lot of ppl had to medals saved b4 expac came out
that looks like it very well could be kristen ritter .
not caring about your needs is n't a great sign in a relationship and could point to other reasons he 's withdrawing .
some people withhold sex as a power play but there would probably be other controlling behaviors that would be present .
or is intimacy part of the package of needs he 's not willing to meet as well as sex ?
i 'm no sex therapist but i took a class with the professor who taught human sexuality and she said then 1998 that most sexual dysfunction was psychological in cause .
i 'm not sure if that 's still considered to be the case but his lack of sex drive could point to deeper issues .
is this a change in behavior or has he always had low drive ?
i 've watched marriages fall apart over differences in sex drive so he should take the issue seriously imho .
yes it 's about the release of orgasm but sex is also about intimacy expressing our love feeling wanted and desired and so many other things .
an unwillingness to work on yourself for your partner is a sign that something deeper may be at work many people make an effort to satisfy their partner ‘s needs even when their own drive is low .
both partners ideally work on any issue in a marriage make an effort compromise etc .
both people have to make adjustments to make a marriage work .
some people are naturally less interested in sex and that 's something you hopefully knew before you married him .
the open relationships i 've witnessed and there 's a good-sized poly community where i 'm from have been complicated and take a great deal of effort to manage .
if he 's unwilling to talk about how that would work there 's a possibility he 's sabotaging your marriage by setting you up to be the bad guy who ruins the marriage by going elsewhere for sex .
well that 's about 4 scenarios that are possible y'all really need a trained therapist to pick apart what 's actually happening in your case .
you both deserve to have an effort made to meet your needs whatever they may be .
my needs are n't being met either but i 'm not in a relationship so it may be less frustrating .
i do n't know if i would feel loved if i was lying next to someone night after night who was n't interested in playing .
i think i 'd feel really lonely and sad .

this is where your due diligence comes into play ... . do you believe them and do you trust them to make good of their promise ?
im pissed that i dont like kiwami bc its so much cheaper lol
and how does his 2p not tell the whole story of his 2p shooting ?
because you need to look at the breakdown of when and where the 2p are coming from .
if you looked at how he was getting them that should have shown you concern as he was having trouble pulling up when driving right ...
your argument was but he shot 70 from 2p '' and i am telling you if you looked at how and where he was able to and not able to get those shots off the break down tells us a clearer picture .
the 70 does n't tell you shit really especially considering the extremely low volume .
my point being the lakers had that info available to know his shot needed work .
you used that as a defense for why they would n't .
his is missing the same shots at the rim this year he made last year .
hes not just missing '' hes straight getting blocked and or missing layups when there is contact .
he had issues with contact in college this is not news either .

my father is a country music musician and played as a house band for awhile and was present when some guy came in asking the bar if it had a liscence agreement for the songs on the jukebox .
worked as a cook at a sports bar myself and we had someone come in asking if we had the licences for the leagues we were showing on the tvs .

honestly both guns are great options and it does come down to personal preference taking into account aftermarket support and price .
2/3 years and a p-09 for 1 year and both guns have been amazing .
both feel very nice have great performance and are n't terrible on either green gas or co2 .
the main issue i have had with the p-09 is parts .
after dropping 2 of my magazines and breaking the base plates i 've been unable to find spares admittedly i have n't looked too hard other than some aluminium ones the same price as a new magazine .
the g17 however has multiple styles of base plates as cheap as 20p each .
i was also unable to find a left handed hard holster at the time of purchase too though again i did n't look too hard .
while not affecting the function of the gun it does get scraped up quite easily and parts such as the trigger bar have worn so the trigger no longer stays back when fired and empty .
the p-09 does feel to be of a higher quality construction .
i 'd expect you would be satisfied with either choice but each has a set of advantages .
if you have any other questions let me know .
for compressors you really do n't want to be spending hundreds on it .
you really only care about two things how noisy it is and will it run for as long as you want it to .
compressors get quite hot which means they have thermal trips to shut it down to prevent damage .
a great safety feature but frustrating if you have to stop every half an hour .
a compressor with a tank helps this because even if it does stop you still have pressure in the tank it also means you can build up pressure in the tank in advance .
the airbrush itself i think is good to start with but you 'll probably change it up in a few months .
i started with a kit like this and it has a 0.2mm airbrush this one is 0.3mm and it ended up being a nightmare .
i was strip cleaning it more than i was using it in the end even with twice the recommended amount of flow improver .
the problem really is that it was just a cheap brush like this one is .
you 'll get to practice on something that is not expensive and you 'll learn a lot more from it as well .
now it may be that it is a great brush but i suspect that after a few months you 'll have the same frustrations .
if so then i suggest stepping up to a brush around £100 .
unlike airbrush thinner which can dry the paint faster flow improver is a better medium .
you could although i do n't suggest it even use regular thick paint if you add enough flow improver to it like 2/3rd flow improver .
but a couple of drops into proper airbrush paint is still a great way to help prevent paint drying in/on the brush .
i 'm no expert and have only been doing this for 4 months now so take what i say as observations of a noob rather than expert advice .

given the distribution of income and tax paid demographics in canada 70 all people who file a tax return pay only 13 of the income taxes .
those taxpayers are in the 0 50k income range .
1 of people who file a return report 250k of income and above .
they pay 21 of all income tax in canada .
that leaves 29 of the remaining taxpayers in canada paying 66 of all income taxes .
these taxpayers are in the 50k up to 250k income range .
where exactly the middle class '' exists is not well defined but one thing is for sure the govt ca n't get more tax revenue out of the 70 of folks who report 0 50k of income they simply ca n't afford to pay more .
if you take out the 1 there is no where else for the revenue to come from but the middle class .
the other 29 of taxpayers are the ones who get clobbered by the constant thirst for more revenue in ottawa .
any time a politician tells us they are going to tax the rich more do n't believe it .

like if a kid has been talking about wanting a ps4 really badly because all of his friends play it and he feels left out only having a 360 but knows his family is living paycheck to paycheck and understands the money just is n't there .
his dad wants to surprise him and has been saving up for a couple of months .
he looks to get a used one because that 's all he can afford .
so he posts an ad on craigslist to buy a used playstation for his son for 180 .
a guy answers the ad and says he 'll do it for 170 because he feels for his situation .
so the deal goes down and the dad is so excited to see his son 's reaction it will be such a surprise because he rarely gets the chance to do things like this with anything expensive .
he shows his son and it is obvious his son is touched by the gesture and thanks him but has an awkward look on his face that is quite noticeable .
the father can tell something is up and asks his son what is wrong .
the son sheepishly says dad i know you did n't know any better but this is a ps3 the old console that is the playstation version that is the same generation as my xbox . ''
the dad fels so embarrassed and also mad at the gut on craigslist for obviously taking advantage of someone he knew would n't know any better .
sorry for this little story i have seen something similar and it always makes me feel so bad and wanted to share .
in this case it is obvious to feel bad for the dad because he had the best intentions and did n't know any better .
probably should have consulted with the son but wanted to surprise him which is reasonable .
could have asked someone else though to be certain .

it 's a side of training/recovery for top level athletes that 's either not publicly discussed or only discussed in veiled tones .
being interested in all aspects of strongman i think this sort of thing is worth discussing .
some will say it ca n't be discussed due to being illegal or scaring away sponsors .
well plenty of open steroid users have had successful careers as athletes especially when there 's no central governing authority like the nba or nfl or the olympics .
and illegality certainly does n't stop popular musicians from talking openly about drug use or selling drugs in their songs .
i wish more athletes or trainers would talk openly about it .

this is one i 've been excited about since the press release .
a 100 proof non-chill filtered offering from beam clocking in at 20-ish .
binny 's released it today and i happened to swing in this afternoon for something else so of course i came home with a bottle .
nose vanilla sweet caramel and just a touch of oak
body sweet notes of honey brown sugar and maybe even mint that then give way to the beam peanut funk
4 sub-par not bad however many others i 'd rather drink .
6 very good a cut above your average daily .
distiller 's cut takes the improved beam profile of black and then adds on proof and non-chill filtering .
i ca n't tell you if skipping the filtering really adds flavor or if it 's just the added proof that makes this a dramatic step up from beam black .
but what i can say is that if you generally like the beam profile this is absolutely a no-brainer .
it 's priced at 22 here the same price as black .
supposedly this is a limited release if that 's true i would definitely consider picking up a full case .
fred noe really did the beam fans a solid with this offering .

while i hated the way they ended season 6 on a cliffhanger negan 's arrival and the death of abraham and glenn and that whole episode season 7 's premiere were very powerful and well-done .
since then the show has been up and down all over the place .
and even negan who i liked for quite a while is getting boring for me .
i liked him most of last season with carl and sasha and even the ending of the season .
this season however i do n't really care about him .
tonight he literally did have part of a moment '' with carl where he seemed to question things .
and negan even makes that comment that we were having a moment '' and yet the plot-line sort of threw it all aside .
even if they brought one they would n't use it in this situation .
their reasoning for shooting the guy is that they thought he was reaching for a gun .
if you suspect someone has a gun why would you tase them ?
what if one of the prongs does n't stick or you miss ?
then if the guy has a gun he has time to draw it and kill you .

i just feel fallout has lost sight of what it needs to be .
what made fallout 1 2 and new vegas so great was that you could control the politics of the world much more directly you can even become a genocidal maniac and the games allows that and the huge amount of comedy in the series .
fallout 3 and 4 pretty much turned it into a bit of an action adventure where the core story is mostly that of a hero 's journey .

i 'm not sure how the pediatric and geriatric populations are reporting since they are the target population for the vaccine .
there 's also the question of whether the conjugate or polysaccharide causes more side effects .
the pneumococcal vaccine has been recalled twice before so one of the vaccines may just need some adjustments .
what it means is that if you had simply put that money into bitcoin instead of iota you would have a higher profit .
this is due to btc outpacing the coin of interest .
on the other hand for example if iota to btc ratio goes up .
you can read that as iota going up in value faster than the speed of btc

you do n't seem to understand how depression works .
you lie to yourself so much that you do n't believe the actual truth and deny or go into a defensive state .

how does this not equally apply to the social contract that libertarians so often reject ?
if you do n't like paying taxes simply move .
our penises exit out of the body perpendicular to the torso while the vagina is going up and into the torso in a direction parallel to the torso .
because of this our thrusting motion is exactly the same as their grinding motion .
so rather than lifting and dropping to slide up and down have her grind back and forth between your legs to slide you in and out of her
you have good eyes ... your rocket league skills would have made me think otherwise.. lol
it 's sold on the basis that so many eyeballs unique users will 'engage ' with said 'content ' .
there 's a huge knowledge gap in the industry between legitimate users you and i going about our day consuming the web and marketing directors who have their target of delivering their brand message to x number of people a quarter at these brands .
for the most part they simply do n't know shit and so go by whatever metrics are deemed acceptable by 'the industry ' in this case the industry being media owners and the advertising agencies .
usually they 're old enough to have been promoted to the level where they can sign off hundreds of thousands of dollars in marketing expenditure however in many ways too old to be bothered to have adapted to the way that we actual real life consumers of digital media engage with ... well fucking anything .
this is the secondary slurry of shit derivitave of the cancer that is 'native content ' .
the second you land on the referral page bam .
you 're a unique user reached and therefore converted into .

for the marketing director because he 's reaching eyeballs with the brand 's message

yes you can get the death penalty for use of a weapon of mass destruction .
maybe this is different because it did n't result in death but honestly i wonder attempted murder is just as bad as murder you should n't get off light just because you 're incompetent .

i think what he 's saying is that they 're not making millions off of youtube alone they have to rely on additional income streams .
especially in the last 6 months or so as advertisers have pulled back from youtube and they 've aggressively pursued demonetization .
they are with a brand new arena cards chests etc .

investors have been assuming trump would fuck over the lower and middle class by deregulation and generally funneling more money to the top so of course they were optimistic from the get go .
if he ever gets his tariffs passed he suck even more money to the top while the cost of living skyrockets and the market will go even higher .

you could try installing a centos7 box finding an old freepbx install matching the version they are currently running then do a back up/restore and start the upgrade path but i doubt many people from the freepbx project would recommend that route .
majority of hollywood whether in music or movies constantly thrive on sex culture .
they treat it as a transaction instead of something with any meaning .

franken was all but forced to retire in similar circumstances .
as someone on the right it wasnt similar and not fair to franken in my view .
air grabbing boobs over body armor is kind of ridiculous .

one side is pro white and one is antiwhite not even pro anything else .
many on the right would vote for center left policies to make us more like europe if it werent for the racial tensions being foisted on a large number of them that would like nothing else than to be left alone and leave others alone
tried mr. salt e and while it 's better than spending so much on pods all of the time i was overall disappointed in the flavor of their juices .
minty menthol is about as close as you can get to juul mint .
it tastes almost identical and while the throat hit is n't as harsh i could barely tell which was which when switching them out .
not as flavorful as the actual juul mango but still much better than mr. salt .
i also feel like the levelup juices are closer to the consistency of the juul juices and give you the crackle that we all long for when hitting the juul .
if it comes to ps4 i 'll definitely give it a look .
first time hearing about it i hope my gt 630 can handle it !
it was never a challenging game against the zombies at any point in the original mod or the standalone .
did they make this promise during an interview or something ?
ever since i started pretty early on in the mod the zombies were just a buffer between you and other players and nothing challenging unless you were just stupid or you got into a fight with other players in the midst of zombies .
delighted to hear it was exactly what you wanted .
but seriously i 'm imagining some kind of inner 3/16 '' hose coil or something hidden in there .
ah thanks i would never have figured that out on my own .
to me it is reminiscent of the famous speech from the wire about the war on drugs .

i 've been eating it i 'm so upset .
but also upset i did n't look for myself and trusted someone else .
i really ca n't fathom of the thinking behind killing carl off .
i mean they wanted to kill off someone who could have a substantial impact on rick and his viewpoint ?
how about ... i dunno ... the guy who we know is leaving the show anyway in morgan ?
he 's been the moral compass before he built the jail ... it would make perfect sense .
so now we just wait for his death or for him to leave on a john locke-ian walkabout ?
this could have given his departure way more meaning .
hell daryl is my favorite but he could have a comparable effect on rick and the story as well .
and i 'd get if the show decided it was time for him to go .
it really feels like they just killed him off because he was the last one people expected but for good reason .
we all assumed the storytellers had enough competence to not kill off the character that made the least amount of sense for some shock ratings .
and on top of that they do it with a walker bite ?
at least let him go down in glory nobody should just be dying of a walker bite in season 8 .
you know ive been cleaning my teeth all these years with a brush like someone born in the 20th century ... i had no idea i could have been chewing on a dirty ass stick to do the same job !

2nd edit i have recently been educated about post tubal ligation syndrome .
this is about getting off birth control after surgery !
thank you to the kind redditor for pointing out the potential confusion .
there were some complications with my insurance a few months ago so i went without my hormone birth control for a month .
i have been on bc every month since i was 15 so i noticed a few changes in my body
off bc initially my vagina was very dry but it eventually got better .
i also got some face and shoulder pimples i 'm 23 so that 's probably normal and i lost some weight .
the most liberating symptom though is how emotionally stable i felt .
i 'm definitely biased because i do n't want to be on bc but i felt like my emotional fuse was much longer and less easy to light .
example while i was off bc i got a 48 on an exam this semester my first failed exam of my 5 years in college and that would have sent me into a tear-filled frenzy .
during the failure i was upset but after thinking on it for a few hours i was able to email my professor admit my mistakes and get a plan together on how to come back from it .
my goal is to get sterilized and being off bc gave me an idea of what kind of body changes i 'll experience after edit getting off bc after my surgery .
i wanted to see what kind of things if any other sterilized women have experienced edit after getting off bc ?
edit just to clarify i 'm talking about body changes from getting off birth control .
i plan to take bc until i get sterilized so that 's why i 'm expecting body changes after i get the surgery because then i 'll stop hormone bc .
hi was an avid yuonmai/yorukaze and all the different names it had user and am looking for a new site to be a part of .
i 'm a 21 year old mtf tansgender studying psychology at university .
i discovered that i 'm trans 2 years ago and i have really strong dysphoria since then .
i know my discovery is a bit late but i 'm not the text book transgender .
i grew up in a very conservative christian community where being part of the lgbt community or being feminin as a boy were considered a sin .
i was always feminin and emotional and i was bullied for it a lot .
my parents always treated me like a boy so basically i was pretty ok with my gender .
also i didnt question my gender as i have a twin brother and people always said we were the same .
i did n't really like my body the secondary sex caracteristics e.g facial hair and so on .
and i started frequently imagining myself as a girl and sometimes i wished i was a girl but did n't know why .
also i 've been always attracted to girls but i realised that when i imagine myself as a girl i 'm attracted to guys too .
you could say i 'm an autogynephile it was weird so i tried to overcompensate it with working out and acting more manly .
as i finished high school i grew my hair out and started to cross dress and it felt so right .
i really envy women and want to be like them .
my heart is broken that i cant be pregnant or a mother .
i want to look like them and being treated as one of them .
it 's an injustice that i had to be born as male .
despite this i also have a male side e.g .
and i dont know what to do with it .
i like both my female and male side because it protects me from being harmed although i am more female than male .
i want to have a girls body and being treated as a girl so badly but i 'm not sure if i change my mind later .
actually i 'm disgusted of older women older than 60 because generally they are not pretty at all weak and people view them as incompetent .
i cant imagine myself as an old lady nor as an old man .
but being and old man is generally easier because you remain handsome and people respect you .
i hate being male and dont want to live my life as one but being female has some disadvanteges too e.g .
as you can see i 'm not the basic '' trans girl because i didnt born this way but became like this .
dont know why maybe because i have borderline personality disorder and depression too .
so i dont know if i should transition start hrt or not ?
i go to therapy regularly but the psychiatrist cant really help me .
well if it has got to the point that the spying is a valid option i suppose that speaking about it is not an option.private investigators are the best option but it is the most expensive one especially if you got it wrong .
the worst option is for you to take the role of a private investigator .
i got the mail of a very competent and 100 trustworthy hacker here on reddit you can contact him
i contacted him we spoke over the phone couple of times he helped me hack my lost iphone infidelity in a relationship is something that happens from either party in a relationship at some point in time when you start suspecting that your partner is cheating you start losing trust in him or her .
but if you do n't confirm whether he or she is cheating you might be accusing your spouse wrongly .
i started suspecting my partner not long ago but i had no concrete evidence then i was recommended to this professional hacker .
he helped me to expose all my partner 's secret by hacking into my partner 's snapchat and other social media accounts .
at very affordable and perfect price ... ..his other jobs include all types of mobile hacks credit score upgrades unrestricted and unnoticeable access to your partner/spouse/anybodys facebook account email whatsapp messages .
he also makes changes in databases/websites such as your college/university grades he is a professional hacker .

i just received a letter from a lawyer in chicago stating that i had been arrested for some sort of violation and that they are sending a letter to offer me legal services .
i have never been arrested in my life could someone be using my name and if so how do i find out what they have been accused of and straighten everything out .
should i contact the lawyer or could this whole thing be a scam ?
the lawyer has an 800 number here is his info
as a cpd creator i 'm trying to understand risks of holding peth .
for the dec 17 initial release of dai i understand cdp owners will collateralize cdps in peth and that peth will start as 1 to 1 ratio match to eth .
if eth experiences normal volatility peth will appreciate relative to eth as cdps are liquidated and peth holders benefit from burned cdp fees .
if there are snap moments of extreme downward volatility peth will depreciate relative to eth as new peth is minted to cover the collateral gap .
and if a black swan event occurs mkr holders can vote to initiate a global settlement that will reset the system .
can the system sustain a 30 negative eth swing in a day/hour/week w/o peth dilution ?
related how can we quantify snap moments of extreme volatility '' which would dilute the value of peth ?
how diluted would peth need to become for mkr to trigger global settlement ?
given mkr holders are n't necessarily peth holders i expect pain tolerance for peth dilution may be higher
as a cdp creator i 'll want to quantify the risk of holding peth with some precise variables .
when dai moves to multi-collateral and mkr is substituted for peth i expect cdp creators will be far less concerned about this but let 's talk about the present state .
i am using the irremote library to transmit infrared using an ir led thats currently connected resistor arduino pin however i get a really short range how could i increase it ?
hey guys so i got to york yesterday and when i got off the 196 .
i saw a bunch of teenagers running out of shoppers with with tons of shavers and the security wiring still around them beeping .
they were laughing and just running around while everyone was just staring .
i hit the emergency button for security and i told them that i see a bunch of people with goods stolen from shoppers literally just sitting and waiting in the bus route .
they told me that i have to go into shoppers to file to file this story lmao .
which they said there 's nothing we can do .
what really bothered me was these 4 kids knew no one can touch them and they found it funny .
wanted to post a detailed review of the aftermath server .
i have made some comments about it here on reddit but i have not really gone into much detail and i feel like the server really does deserve more than just a few comments .
i have tried 7 different emu servers over the past year plus and will explain why i decided to make aftermath my home .
i played swg from launch until the dark time until the nge ! ! ! !
i am an older player as are many of us and i have a family that does take some time .
so having xp rates boosted a bit is a plus and really minimizes the tedious grind that can occur with some of the professions .
however the rates are not boosted so much as to marginalize the grinding process .
on aftermath the xp rates are 2.5x xp for combat and 5x for crafting while jedi do not get an xp .
were it really helps imo is grinds like armorsmith and bh investigation .
another advantage of aftermath is the grouping incentive on the server .
if you plan on running solo mission to grind credits you do not have to split the payout and get to keep all the credits .
this imo is a smart move as it pumps money into the economy and allows the crafters to earn enough cash to keep their harvesters mats and resources .
while at the same time allowing players to purchase items needed to participate in events high-end mobs and pvp far more quickly .
also spin groups are a thing here and you get full xp for just hitting a mob once which promotes grouping with old and new friends and helps move jedi grind along greatly .
yes you will get visibility however with the custom tef system your group mates can help protect you while you gain large amounts of xp relatively quick .
the armor system here allows all basic humanoid armor sets chitin ubese mabari bone and padded to achieve up to 90 kinetic and be just as good as composite armor .
the resource requirements have also been changed to mirror the difficulty of composite .
this will allow armorsmiths to sell many more armor sets and gives players more choice in what armor they would like to wear .
the gcw on aftermath is a unique system that rewards planetary control and pvp gcw credits received from db'ing an opposing faction player and using them gcw credits to you a slot machine vendor to roll on ancient krayt tat axvia miv corellia ackly naboo and fire spider dant loot .
this has led to more base busting and pvp than i have seen on any other server .
i think it was well thought out and with more people will only get better .
there are more changes to the gcw these are just a few .
another great change has been pve with a new custom bunker with custom npcs added on lok .
they also changed the super battle droids in the corellian corvette to have a chance to drop cl 300 clothing armor attachments and increased combat level of battle droids and super battle droids in the death watch bunker to 300 so they now potentially drop high-level clothing and armor attachments .
this has helped a lot not only gearing out your character but given the community more options and better odds and high-level items .
the one thing that really grabbed my attention when i first started playing on aftermath was the qol changes that were made .
here is a small list of some of them .
the mission drop down tab will now display what the lair type is without having to examine it .
bounty hunter terminals now display the level of the mission in the name .
house item limit increased to 250 items per lot .
clothing and armor attachments now display the stat on the item name itself .
you can now invite to group from any distance .
i played on shadowfire which was one of the smaller servers but it never felt like it .
we had one hell of a community and some great rivalries that sparked memorable pvp will still talk about all these years later .
for me aftermaths community is hands down the nicest and most helpful community i have found in an mmorpg period .
there is a discord bot that links discord to general chat in game and is usually very active in the evening and weekends .
the dev team is great as they are very active and responsive to questions and issues that arise and you also get a lot of help from the community through discord which is really where all the info is .
there is more to this server than i listed that make is a great place to call home for your swg gaming including custom jedi system more viable range professions and other qol changes .
however the combat system is still pre-cu and feels like home .
all in all aftermath is my favorite emu server and will remain my swg home for as long as i still play and from a shadowfire perspective it is vf approved ...
the other cat i got from my mom lexie is in the kitty hospital right now and i am so upset .
i 'm trying not to go crazy because as of right now i do n't really know what 's going on they have more to figure out .
she had n't been eating or drinking very much and for years before that she 'd been throwing up chronically i took her home last year before i moved away .
my mother had been threatening to send her to a shelter and demanding my pet carrier to do it .
she would n't turn her over to me until she thought i was giving her to someone else .
sadly this is n't the first time this type of scenario has happened with her and i was stupid enough to give lexie back five years ago after my mother swore she 'd never ever do it again .
so i 've had her since this happened again last year and i 'd been planning to keep lexie and had gone nc with nmom about five months ago .
not only me but i feel like my poor cat is being punished for some reason .
i always thought that cat was better off in another home because my mother never liked her from the moment she brought her home nine years ago .
i ca n't give her the lifestyle she was used to at my mom 's house with a big house and going inside and outside at will .
i live in a bed-bug infested studio apartment and have another cat my mother 's other former cat whom they do n't get along with .
i feel like if my mother had just given her away maybe none of this would 've happened .
she did n't really want a better life for this cat she just did this to punish me .
and how well does the current arima not the breaker but the red type apologies forgetting the specific name fair well with the breaker one ?
thought i 'd share this with everyone that has a nexus player running 8.0.0 .
a few weeks ago after i upgraded my nexus player to 8.0.0 i noticed that i could no longer hit the pause button the remote to pause video on ps vue .
it would act all sporadic and go from play/pause rapidly until i exited the app .
the newest ps vue app update did n't fix the problem it did make it where it did n't jump between play/pause now it just does n't do anything .
today i got on support chat with ps vue and the support rep i spoke with wanted to troubleshoot the problem .
finally i got that person to upgrade the nexus player they had in the office to 8.0.0 and they were able to reproduce the problem .
so they are aware of it now and are supposed to be working on fixing it .
i so often leave movies feeling morose for them showing me what can never be .
theres a whole interesting fantastical world that i can never be a part of dancing just out of reach .
beautiful things beautiful people but i may not partake simply taste .
confined to this flesh prison until i expire having done nothing of import nor impact .
i yearn for a life beyond mine but there will be none .
is there any chance we get argentina chile uruguay etc .
as one of the new civs in the upcoming dlc ?
i always felt there was a lack of south american civs ...
i 'm a f2p player that has been gone for about a year now and i did n't really know what 's really going on for the 4 months or so that i did play .
anyway i basically saw that eve is expanding the ship pool for alpha clones i 'm quite tempted to come back .
just wondering has anything changed what ship should i work for and what 's the best way to make isk right now ?
before i left i have trained enough skills for a drone boat vextor set up and i have about 287 mil isk hoarded up .
i 'm also in pandemic horde 's newbie corp last time i checked if that 's relevant at all .
anyway i know this could probably done with google but there are so many contradictory/outdated info it 's kind of overwhelming so thanks to anyone willing to give advices !
in the fall of my ninth birthday my family moved from a small two-bedroom apartment to a six-bedroom farmhouse .
we had n't lived in a city necessarily more like a big town but compared to the country surrounding the farmhouse it might as well have been new york city .
the house was n't exactly in the best shape shingles hung loosely from the roof like crooked teeth the shutters were missing several grey once black slats and the red paint on the vinyl siding was being eaten away by age and disrepair .
despite my parents referring to the house as a farmhouse my whole life i 've realized as an adult that the building is surprisingly modern for the year it was built .
having stood at least through the seventies if not before the house 's roof slanted at a gradual angle from the left only a few feet above the ground towards the right side of the house which ended in a curved wall stretching high probably fifty or so feet into the air .
while the left side was made up of edges and planes the curved right wall laced with bay windows topped with abstract stained glass softened the angles of the house .
the curved wall ended in a steepled tower sticking out from the roof .
a small window was recessed into the tower and my heart fluttered with excitement the first time i saw it .
i knew before stepping foot into our new home that that room would be mine .
mom explained that we moved into the farmhouse for my dad because the house came with a large barn .
construction-site supervisor by day woodworker by night my dad 's dream had always been to have his own workshop and make woodworking his full-time job .
when we did n't have the space woodworking was just a passion a well-loved hobby that took my dad across the river to a mill-turned-studio-space a few nights a week .
we had only lived in the farmhouse for a few months before the barn had been transformed into a woodworker 's paradise .
the first floor consisted of a kitchen pantry living room dining room and a sun room off the back .
i did not spend much time on that floor the first day .
instead i spent the first hour drifting frantically from one bedroom to the next searching for the room which was to become my own .
the second floor of the house was half open space and half bedrooms .
the hallway instead of lined with two walls was lined with doors to the rooms on one side and a railing overlooking the living room on the other .
standing at the railing gave you an all encompassing view of the living room while the slanted roof of the first and second floor hung low over your head .
i ran from room to room in glee standing in the middle of each inhaling the dusty air deeply then running out in a burst of excitement to see the next .
none of the four rooms on the second floor were satisfactory so i ran up the creaking wooden steps to the third floor .
the third floor was smaller than the second floor the ceiling cutting into it so that it only took up half the width of the house .
i explored the two large rooms set on opposite sides of the hall identical to each other both dirty with disuse .
i left the twin rooms in haste knowing that i had been prolonging the discovery of my bedroom drawing out the inevitable exploration of the tower .
my expedition brought me to the far side of the thin hallway which ended in a small white door .
i opened it without caution and was rewarded with a narrow staircase .
thick layers of cobwebs traced the corners of the stairs worn from footfalls over the years which had created shallow divots in the middle of each step .
my enthusiasm waned as i looked up into the darkness which was complete and suffocating .
i searched the wall beside me for a light switch but there was none .
i steadied myself and took one hesitant step up into the black .
the steps groaned beneath my weight as i took each with a deliberate determination .
my vision began to fade into shadow but as i crept to the top of the stairs i noticed a slight light coming from my right .
soon i lifted my foot and almost fell with surprise at the lack of another step i was at the top .
i turned to the square source of light a window and walked towards it .
as i approached i realized that there were small shutters blocking the light locked in place by a small silver hook .
i lifted the hook and threw the shutters back with a bang much louder than expected .
the fourth floor of the farmhouse was suddenly bathed in muted sunlight coming from the grimey panes of the window .
i was standing in the interior of the tower .
the room was small about 10 feet across in either direction .
the walls were entirely round surrounding me in an almost perfect circle on one side of the stairs the wall was cut short by about three feet of brick wall that jutted out into the space .
the brick continued up past the ceiling the chimney i realized .
i walked towards it and looked down the stairs from where i had come now illuminated faintly .
there was a small ledge about three feet high two feet wide and two feet across cut into the wall between the outside and the stairs to the tower .
the ledge was blocked partially by the wooden railing .
small dingy and lacking light my heart fluttered with the tickle of love at first sight .
i ran down the stairs skipping steps all together in my excitement to tell my mom and dad that i had found my new bedroom .
within a week my tower had been cleaned and my mom had painted the walls a dark blue .
small white circles dotted the ceiling making up constellations of stars for me to look at every night and memorize .
we hung white christmas lights to give my dark room a warm glow .
the back of my white metal bed frame rested against the brick chimney which allowed my bed to be flat against the otherwise curved wall .
i filled the nook in the staircase with stuffed animals and action figures .
a tall bookcase and dresser along with a small desk and chair completed the room .
i remember snuggling between the fresh sheets perfectly at peace with my new home .
as i drifted to sleep i heard a small rustling noise coming from the chimney behind me .
as november descended on the farmhouse a cold draft began to manifest against the thin walls tendrils of the wintry chill outside sneaky soundlessly towards the warm insides of the house .
on the first frigid night dad tried to light a fire in the living room fireplace .
the flames grew quickly reaching high into the chimney as the downstairs quickly filled with a noxious black cloud .
mom threw every window open wide as my dad took me out onto the front yard and then ran back in .
the image of black smoke pouring from the windows of the farmhouse slowly being repaired and repainted but still looking old and worn was terrifying yet beautiful .
the black smoke looked evil and dangerous but the contrast of it against the red and flaking walls of the house was striking leaving a lasting impression on my young mind .
my parents soon got the fire and smoke under control and i was lead back into the house which now smelled like burnt toast .
or pay an expert to do it. my mom suggested .
the next day small electric heaters appeared around the house .
but the fire had stirred something inside the chimney .
the small rustling i heard at night grew louder almost as if distressed .
i was unnerved by the sound but i restrained myself from running to my parents ' room .
my dad had warned me that i was getting too old to sleep with them .
i wanted to prove to him that i was a big boy that i could sleep in my own room .
but the noise was chilling like the rustling of paper .
chittering and skittering the sound of a muffled maraca .
on one hand it sounded like the rainstick mrs. paxon my teacher had brought into class once .
she turned it one way and then the other the cooling hiss of sand running over nails and wood creating ghostly tingles at the back of my neck .
but it was also menacing like a stampede in the distance the combined force of hundreds of animals unaware of the damage caused by the combined power of their hooved feet .
one saturday morning over pancakes with maple syrup and thick strips of fatty bacon i told my father that there was a ghost living in the chimney and i could hear him moving at night .
his laugh was hearty and warm it 's probably just mice he said over mouthfuls of sticky pancake i bet their nest is what 's blocking the damn chimney.
when we had first moved in there were mice in the barn .
dad bought traps and i cried because he was going to kill them .
he ended up buying non-lethal mouse traps and releasing the ones he caught far from the house .
but in the process i had learned what mice sound like and whatever was in the chimney was not mice .
if it is mice there must be hundreds ! i exclaimed dramatically .
once the pancakes and bacon had been eaten and the coffee and orange juice finished my dad and i went to the fireplace .
dad knelt down on his knees and shone a flashlight up towards the top of the chimney .
he moved the beam of light this way and that his eyes squinting .
there 's definitely something up there. he craned his neck further .
what the ... he said as his light caught the culprit .
suddenly my father jumped backwards banging his head hard against the brick opening .
ah fuck ! he cried falling onto the living room floor .
i stepped back in surprise my father never swore .
jesus fucking christ ! he yelled scooting away from the fireplace in absolute horror .
my mom ran in from the kitchen what is it ?
what 's wrong ? she asked her face strained with worry .
dad stood up roughly wiping at his sleeves and front as if rubbing burning embers from his shirt .
mark ! my mother scolded worry turning into displeasure .
goddamn spiders ! he seethed the bloody chimney is full of them !
they stared at each other my mom 's mouth slightly agape my father 's body rising and falling with his angry breath .
the silence was broken with my mother 's warm laughter .
this is n't funny ! my dad said which made my mother laugh even harder .
wiping tears from her eyes her laughter finally settled and she looked up at my dad .
two hundred and twenty pounds of muscle and bone hard work and calluses .
that was the day i discovered the only things my father feared were losing me and my mother and spiders .
want me to squash them for you ? my mother chided .
it 's not funny my father said a small tone of embarrassment in his voice these bastards are huge .
wolf spiders probably. he shivered and my mom smiled at him as she rubbed him arm tenderly .
we 'll call someone in to take care of them.
we do n't have the money. my father said in a hushed tone .
well my mother said her voice loud as if to compensate for his whisper in the meantime they have n't done anything to us yet other than block our chimney so i think we 'll survive for another week or so until we 've got the funds. she wrapped an arm around my father his pride wounded .
dad grunted at her as he stared threateningly at a floorboard as if it had personally affronted him .
a few weeks later and the spiders remained in our chimney .
dad did n't seem to be selling his woodwork as much as he thought he would and because all the construction sites were closed until the snow cleared he could n't get another job in the meantime .
mom was working extra shifts at the hospital but still the spiders stayed .
but i guess it had been their house first .
at night i 'd hear their hairy paws scuttering across the bare bricks by my head and i 'd hug my teddy bear tight .
dad had gone from the first floor to my tower filling any holes in the bricks with foam insulation to keep them contained .
we 'd often forget about our creepy housemates however and in those moments the place felt warm and loving .
dad had gotten the oil heater in the basement running again and so dry heat emanated from the radiators throughout the house .
mom fixed up two of the rooms as guest rooms for when family and friends visited one as a playroom for me and the last room as a computer room .
the old and forgotten house quickly morphed into an inviting home .
our first christmas in the farmhouse was an exciting one .
mom had gone all out decorating the house lighted pine garlands hung from every railing and mantle lined with candy canes red and green striped stockings hung above the fireplace candles sat in every one of the many windows and our christmas tree towered in the open living room only a foot away from the ceiling that stretched over the first and second floors .
i curled up into bed on christmas eve my skin crackling with the excitement of the coming day .
the room was dark but moonlight streamed through the small window across from me illuminating everything with a silver glow .
my heart was racing and i could hear my blood flowing through my veins filling my ears with a low rumble .
my body was stiff with fear as i strained my ears trying to hear what had waken me .
i no longer believed in santa but even if i did i knew that voice was wrong .
it was the voice of an intruder dry and cracked .
a voice echoing through forgotten crevices etched with time and hate .
ho ... ho ... ho ... the voice creaked again this time louder closer to my face .
my heart stopped the breath i had been taking catching in my throat .
ho ... ho ... ho ... with a boom my heart pounded once loudly and i had to stifle a cry .
i hugged my bear to my chest pursing my lips tight together to prevent my whimpering from escaping my mouth .
ho ... ho ... ho ... the voice said again this time below my bed .
i sat up slowly still clinging my teddy bear and softly placed my feet beside my bed .
ho ... ho ... ho ... it was even fainter now .
as quietly as i could i padded down the stairs .
to know where the sensitive spots were that would scream if you stepped on them .
my socked feet traced the edges making only the softest murmur against the wood .
at the third floor i stood in the doorway of the computer room below my tower and listened .
ho ... ho ... ho ... the voice was getting louder .
not closer but louder as if the one emitting it was getting more invested in the holiday spirit .
the door to my parent 's bedroom opened with a small creak and i jumped .
he looked down saw me and stepped out placing a protective hand on my shoulder .
i had seen the shotgun for the first time a few months beforehand during fall when my father set out to hunt our thanksgiving turkey .
it was a yearly tradition but before the farmhouse the gun would remain locked in dad 's studio .
now it lived in a locked box at the top of my parents ' bedroom closet .
ho ... ho ... ho ... the raspy voice grated through the air sending chills down my spine .
dad looked down and placed a finger to his lip in a gesture of silence .
he turned away from me and we both traced the stairs to the ground floor my confidence rising with the presence of my father and his gun to protect me .
we followed the voice down to the living room which glowed with the soft lights hanging from the christmas tree .
ho ... ho ... ho ... the voice trickled through the opening of the fireplace echoing along the brick walls magnifying till it reached out towards us grasping for us my father towering in the middle of the room and i cowering behind the couch peeking over the back .
the shape came forward reaching out and then landed on the wooden floor with a soft click .
we stared at the shape unable to recognize it .
it was thick and long jointed and knobby like a stick but the surface was smooth and shiney and black .
it stretched out into the living room but the other end was still unseen hidden deep inside the chimney .
whatever we were seeing was only part of it .
ho ... ho ... ho ... the voice was almost upon us hanging heavy in the air like a thick fog .
i shuddered with the cold that emanated from the fireplace .
another black shape identical to the first slithered out .
my father took a step back his gun swinging from one to the other .
a black mass lowered down from the chimney so large it completely filled the fireplace .
it was a dark so black so deep that it seemed like we were staring at nothing at all .
the first shiny black shape rose into the air and landed a foot in front of where it had been the other following the black mass growing as if being pulled forward .
another two of the shapes emerged from the fireplace to join their brother .
my father seemed to realize as well for he ran to the couch grabbed me and pushed me to the stairs .
he turned without checking that i obeyed his orders and lifted the gun again .
i ran up the stairs looking behind me as i did .
the black mass flowed from the fireplace like thick molten lavas growing slowly but containing the power to destroy anything in its path .
i turned the corner of the stairs reached the top and ran to the railing overlooking the living room .
the mass slid out completely followed by another large shadow being vomited forth from our hearth .
two more legs appeared and then the rest of the beast fell and rose no longer constrained by its brick prison .
a giant monster deformed into a grotesque mimicry of a spider towered over my father .
it 's abdomen the size of a large dog covered in coarse hair red like old rust .
two pointed needles stuck out from the bottom snow white strings coming out from between them .
the spider 's spinnerets pulsed as the string slackened slightly .
the threads of silk gooey like a melted marshmallow pulled apart stretching and sticking to everything as the creature stepped forward .
the front section the cephalothorax hung in front of the large round abdomen like it does for a black widow .
but it was not the rounded square of a normal spider .
instead the flat body was replaced with the torso of a very obese man .
shirtless it 's thick gut hung over the top of its abdomen .
what i could see of the chest was covered in rough white hair thick and curly coiled tightly against the pale skin which was littered with brown moles .
two pink nipples chapped and turning white around the edges stuck out from the fur .
the bulging chest was framed by thick arms bulking with muscle and fat the skin hanging loosely thin and puckered like crepe paper .
at the top of the torso was the head of a man .
the skin was moist and dewy it 's rounded cheeks blotchy with red stains .
around its nose were the red and purple lines of broken blood vessels intersecting with each other like the highways on a map .
a heavy long beard fell from its chin a mix of white hair greyed with age and unwash stained on the edges with black soot .
white matted hair flowed from the top of its head and hung loosely around its shoulders .
two large pupil-less eyes sat in the center of its round face staring down at my father .
four smaller eyes rested beneath those like still pools of dark water .
two more were inlaid into its temples one of which i realized my bladder emptying itself in utter horror was looking right a me .
all eight eyes were pitch black and glistening with wetness the reflections of the christmas tree lights making them glint viciously .
warm liquid ran down my inner thigh the stream finding its way into the band of my wool socks .
i could smell the hot scent of urine rising around me .
drool fell from two large pinchers set into the massive jaw of the beast .
the fangs were inverted triangles coming to a thin point like a tiger 's claw .
they were surrounded at the base with the same coarse hair that covered the abdomen but this hair was shorter and thicker .
the muscles at the base of each fang convulsed and twitched separately from each other the pinchers moving out of sync .
the creature straightened its legs raising into the air it 's head brushing against the top of the ceiling .
ho ... ho ... ho ... it cried its humanesque voice filling the large space .
it 's head was level with mine as i stood in shock on the first floor landing .
there was a high pitched scream and i looked to see my mother standing in the doorway of the bedroom she shared with my father .
i could smell decay and blood heavy on its breath .
its face came towards her and i heard a shot .
the room illuminated with a sharp flash of light and the beast erupted in a scream the noise like the bow of a violin being dragged roughly the wrong way against the waxed strings .
it whipped its head towards dad lowering its shoulders so that its eyes were in line with his .
a black leg struck out with lightning speed and my father hit the wall behind him with a crack and a thud .
he fell limply to the floor his gun hitting the wood with a hollow thunk beside him .
i looked at my mother who stood there in shock shaking .
i grabbed her arm as i passed and she followed me easily as if she had lost all agency .
my shoulder slammed hard into a wall as i turned sharply around the corner pushing myself and my mother forward onto the third floor .
hot pain radiated through my arm as i heard the procession of spindly legs on the landing below us .
as we approached i turned to look behind me and saw the creature 's head emerge from the other stairway .
i hesitated drawn by the hideousness and monstrosity of the thing pulling its body something that should n't exist in this world towards us .
my mom had regained her senses and began pulling me up .
i followed tears clouding my sight and ran into my mother 's side as she stopped .
i looked up at her and she picked me up shoving me against something soft .
i blinked tears away and was faced with a stuffed elephant .
i was being pushed into the nook between the wall and the stairs .
i understood and began to climb over my toys .
when i reached the wall cold from the winter night beyond it i turned and with my mom 's help arranged the toys so they covered me as much as possible .
i saw her run up the remaining stairs and heard metal hitting wood with a loud bang .
to my right was the noise of struggling and wood snapping .
my view was soon eclipsed by something large and black .
i strained to keep from screaming as i saw the white flesh of its humanoid shoulders only inches from my face .
my mom screamed and i heard something bounce off the beast with a bodily thud and land on my floor with a crash .
the creature screamed and i saw its abdomen lunged forward past my hiding spot a red blur .
suddenly the room was illuminated with a flash and my ears rang .
the world around me had grown silent my hearing muted as if with cotton .
i saw a white t-shirt emerge cut off by the railing in front of my face .
my hearing slowly came back like a lens coming into focus and i could hear my mother crying softly .
my father 's heavy footsteps rang out as he walked the rest of the way up to my room .
where 's jacob ? he asked his voice flat .
i scooted out from my nook animals and toys falling to the stairs clumsily .
dad ? my voice was small smaller than i had ever heard it .
my father turned towards me his face and shirt wet with a viscous blue liquid .
my mother stepped out from behind my overturned bed .
i climbed the remaining stairs to the tower floor and my father picked me up into a sticky hug .
my mom walked to us and encircled both of us in an embrace .
we shook where we stood heavy blood covering every surface my mom 's soft crying filling the empty silence .
i took a warm bath while my father and mother cleaned up the mess .
i do n't know what they did with that thing 's body .
knowing my father he probably took an axe to it and brought it piece by piece into the woods .
after my bath my mother now wearing jeans and a t-shirt her hair tied loosely into a ponytail high on her head as if in the middle of spring cleaning tucked me into her and my father 's queen bed still clean and dry and kissed me on the forehead .
for most of my life i had thought it had been a horrible nightmare .
every year dad called an exterminator to come to the house and spray paying careful attention to the chimney .
my dad tried to get the chimney cleaned out so we could use the fireplace but no matter what we did or how many professionals we called fires would turn to black smoke filling the house once again with the scent of burnt toast .
last year like most of my peers i went back home for christmas .
my childhood bed has since been replaced with a more comfortable full-size bed but otherwise the room is pretty much how it was when i was a child plus a few band posters and minus a lot of toys .
i still keep my teddy bear however in a special spot on my bookcase and i still fall asleep staring up at the painted stars i have long since memorized .
the rest of the house however has been upgraded .
with the fad of artisan crafted furniture my dad 's woodworking has become a hot commodity .
my parents have completely replaced all the old appliances with fancy high-tech gadgets .
both the roof and the red vinyl siding have been taken apart and completely replaced .
the only thing that remains untouched is the old brick chimney .
the first night i was back i woke up suddenly as if from a nightmare .
the red numbers on the clock beside my face read 3:00 am .
my blood went cold as i heard a rustling beside my head and a soft echo of ho ... ho ... ho ...
this year i 'm a sophomore living in an apartment off campus with some friends .
i invited my parents to spend christmas with me here since my roommates will be away .
i 've cleaned up all the empties and thrown away the old pizza boxes and while it might not be the flashiest of christmases my decorating skills pale compared to my mother 's at least we 'll be safe .

short and sweet i 'm trying to get back into skiing .
can you make some recommendations for a formerly advanced skier who 's pretty overwhelmed by all the changes over the past 15 years ?
i skied from age 4 through age 18 88-2002ish got very good for a nonathletic kid then quit when i moved south for school .
though i skied a few times here and there i owned my old skis and boots so never really saw much of the shift in technology that 's clearly occurred .
now i 'm older and fatter and am back living in the northeast maine .
i 'm determined to become an adequate skier again and could really use some advice/guidance from people who are n't trying to sell me something .
i 'm planning to purchase new equipment at least boots although i know that 's an expensive gamble if this does n't work out .
because i have ridiculously wide calves finding good rental boots is basically out of the question .
there are lots of resources on the internet for finding good boots for fat calves/short legs .
cool but they all reference boot models that are out of date read i wo n't be able to find them in a shop .
i 'm willing to spend money to get something i can really wear .
however i 'm not going to drop 1500 on custom boots .
the problem i 've read the equipment sticky and i 'm not looking for brand recommendations or anything but maybe some help on what to ask for in a boot and how to tell if the fitter is full of shit ?
i 've had unfortunate experiences in the past with ski shops being a bit snotty toward people of unusual sizes and i 'd like to show up educated .
recommendations of specific bootfitters in the boston/maine area would be wonderful as well .
bonus question is muscle memory going to hurt me more than help ?
this might just be a confidence question but man am i going to have to completely learn how to ski again ?
second question would it be better save time for everyone if the game just did n't start by reverting everyone back to their lobbies when a person is n't able to load in ?
my life has had a new meaning ever since i realized i could create my own wet wipes .
bonus points on this lpt for being literally shitty ?
it flies it has 30 missiles and it can be immediately retrieved .
i see at least one of them in every session and god help you if you 're in an aircraft .
with christmas fast approaching i wonder which servant you will give a christmas present to .
you must own the servants to give them a present !
we will assume you can give them anything with the help of the grails or your servants and friends servant but depending on the present it maybe for only christmas day only .
this includes summoning servants you do not have or servants that is n't released yet .
the present ideally would be something that 'll make your servants happy so please do n't troll them .
the only thing you can not gift a servant is blatantly lewd items or by saying mana transfer as that is not a gift just the end result of whatever gift you give them
kiyohime opens a large box to find her master tied up in ribbons with a large note in his mouth saying for kiyohime
ah yes please limit to only 3 – 7 servants who will only get one present from you .
for me the servants i 'll give presents are .
use grail to summon sita for him to spend christmas day with .
use a grail to summon jalter so she can spend christmas with her family i 'm not ready for jalter rate-up !
give them a jason plush toy which is spiritually linked to jason in the throne and to one another .
so medea will trash her copy thus hurting jason .
while medea lily will fix hers thus jason will be caught in a never ending loop of pain and restoring .
i really really hate jason as i run through the okeanos chapter !

just curious as i know people are still waiting .
i 've found boomboxin by midnight tyrannosaurus https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xvbsdmbc7k0 and widowmaker by the definitive https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wd26e-tz6pc and was wondering if anyone knew any other songs that used lines from overwatch .
i already have a 12qt for smaller every day cooks .
i want to get something bigger for big roasts ribs briskets etc .
i really like having a clear bin so i can see it cook not that it matters but mainly to see if its floating or not being covered by water .
however i 'm reading the coleman stack coolers insulate them a lot better .
if i went with the clear bin i 'd probably get a lid eventually or the ping pong ball method .
are there issues with the anova fitting the coleman with a cut out ?
the clear bin i 'm looking at is also 26 quarts which is a little bigger than the 5 gallons that anova is rated for .
i guess i prefer the clear bin but wanted someone to sell me on either or say that theres really no difference .
in some of the pictures the clear bin does n't look that deep which could be an issue too ?
i remember some guy that needed to withdrawal for his sick nephew but had to get verified first .
the last tweet was november 30th ... ive never seen an organization be so quiet .
car sustained minor flooding of the floorboards and the insurance company called it totaled and paid it out but i kept the vehicle dried it out and still drive it daily .
i 'm giving it away at this point to a family member and i do n't know the process .
do i have to get a salvage title and then sign it over ?
can i just sign over the same title i 've always had ?
does anyone have more information about how playoff teams are being decided in the various conferences ?
the only info i have is from the wild west northern ca conference .
they 're divided north/south into two divisions of 5 teams .
1st place in each division hosts 2nd place in the other division and the two winners advance to the national playoffs .
i 've been seeing this girl on and off and every time we go out i feel paranoid .
the date it kinda weird weird enough to allow me to make this post but that 's besides the fact .
if i were to drink my drink i would feel strange mentally and physically .
she ca n't possibly be poisoning me but i hate the way i feel right now .
both exchanges are down but i see the price moving up and down .
who actually has good insurance rates.. let 's say for 9k.. that 's the most expensive i have right now.. but one day probably 20k or 50k ...
hmm tried this question in the newbie section.. guess it was advanced

just a warning for anyone thinking of buying a miner off alibaba .
i saw an l3 for 1200 on alibaba and the seller had a 3 year gold account so i thought it was trustworthy and the price was n't something crazy low making it seem like a scam .
i talked with the seller for a while and they said they only accept moneygram or crypto .
i felt a little weird about it but was just really in the moment and excited to mine and get an l3 in 3 days rather than waiting 3 months on bitmain .
he said it was okay to pay 1000 now and 200 when i get the item and i said that was fine .
i sent it over and they said they received it and would send over a tracking number soon .
i waited an hour and he sent over a tracking number from a company overseas i never heard of .
it showed my order and all the info checked out but it said 2 units instead of 1 .
he said that they sent over too many by accident and said they would call and ask the shipment to be canceled if i did n't pay another 1000 and ship it back for a refund when i get it .
and i felt like i was so far in so i sent over the other 1000 since my friend wanted one too .
that was all the money i had as a college student .
literally everything i saved up and then they deleted their alibaba account and blocked me .
so at this point i guess i 'm out of the crypto game .
i still do n't wan na give up and will continue saving up so i can get back what i lost and even buy a miner from a legit dealer .
i just do n't want anyone else to be a victim .
so be careful when dealing with people online even if it seems like a fair deal .
if anyone can help out with donations like even of 1 to help me get back into investing and teach me ways to play it smarter i 'd really appreciate it .
looking forward to trying the other drakengard titles and nier gestalt .
my logitech g403 wireless has an intermittent tracking problem that seems to have different causes .
the tracking problem causes the mouse to suddenly stop tracking for a fraction of a second when i do a flick on occasion .
this tracking issue was resolved in multiple ways that seemed to fix it but the problem persists .
some causes i have found are putting games in high priority mode possibly causing mouse drivers to not get enough resources mousepad being dirty and dust accumulation on the sensor .
resolving these issues fixed the problem before but the issue is occurring again and i did everything that worked in the past .
is there any way to fix this problem for good ?
did my own dd looked like a strong buy at current levels .
do a quick google search and all you 'll see is analysts saying it 's extremely undervalued and has very high growth potential
can someone who has done their own dd or wants to please tell me why you are going to avoid this stock ?
because i 'm not sure if i 'm maybe missing something here already got in around 102 and am considering adding more..
i 've been craving to play an mmo looter shooter for a while now honestly still surprise why gearbox has n't made an mmo borderlands yet but that 's off topic and after doing some research my choices have been narrowed down to the division and destiny 2 .
destiny 2 's gunplay and graphics honestly look super great to me but all the grief on this sub is giving me second thoughts about buying the game .
conversely from what i 've read the division had the same issues where a lot of the player base left after the launch of the game but apparently the new 1.8 patch that just rolled out fixes a lot of things that went wrong and some people on the division subreddit have compared it to what reaper of souls did for diablo 3 .
since i 'm having trouble deciding can anyone who 's played both games chime in with their thoughts and observations ?
i have a moderately severe hearing loss in both ears .
what are various strengths and weaknesses of major hearing aid brands available in market ?
does anyone scratch when they get depressed or anxious ?
i scratch my arms and thighs to the point of bleeding .
so i 'm finally starting to dive into the new novels .
i thought i was taking a risk thinking it would be to much of a teen novel but i literally could n't put it down .
i was pleasantly surprised by how much i truly enjoyed the book .
yes it had its 'teenage novel ' moments but the story was engaging and beautiful .
i purchased bloodline on the same day expecting to have a month or two of reading material since i 'm not much of a reader but i have a feeling i 'm going to blast through that book as well .
can anyone recommend any other great new canon star wars novels ?
i 've read a bit on this subreddit and heard from friends that the aftermath series is n't really worth much of a read and im also traveling at the moment so i think i 'll wait until i return home until i buy more comics .
also are there any new books coming out soon ?
i bought the v1 headset a few weeks ago for 200 and i think i can still turn it to target.. are there any comparable deals or bundles out there with the v2 headset ?
has anyone been able to find a place with raw sounds from the evolutions specifically agumon 's tri evolution ?
i 've tried ripping it but i ca n't get rid of the background music .
anybody here who does not subscribe to the philosophy or politics of anti-natalism themselves but instead does n't wish to have children of their own because of personal reasons class genetic racial character etc .
on another point i mean i look around and it seems that regardless of the natalist position the anti-natalists are winning anyhow just like the industrialists beat the luddites look at how desperate the natalists look on their forum on reddit for instance .
all socio-historical materialist forces point in the direction of declining fertility anyhow except for rich people who can afford it and as someone who comes from the bottom of the class hierarchy i have no problem with rich-successful people reproducing .
i suppose in a sense anti-natalists do need their own advocates in that we live in a system that subsidizes and rewards having children in indirect and direct ways i.e tax-cuts for married couples child tax cuts funding for education etc i mean i know anti-natalism and being in a monogamous relationship is not mutually exclusive though i am a mgtow myself and would love for discriminatory tax burdens o single anti-natalists to be reduced .
i dunnoe where i was going with this just some thoughts ...

the people on this subreddit are starting to get on my nerves ... ... .i feel like nobody is appreciative of what we 're getting and everybody just complains and is never happy .
it 's either that people do n't understand what goes into a certain feature and why it 's impossible or people just have unrealistic expectations or people are just never happy with what they get .
me i love doom i love fallout and i love almost every game minus a couple of useless indy games that comes out for the vive just because i appreciate all the work that goes into every game .
ca n't we all just take a moment and think about what and why we 're complaining about something before we do ?

so much time and energy during tony 's therapy sessions with dr.melfi are concentrated solely on livia which makes little sense to me .
the often given rationale is how difficult it is for tony to relate to people because of his mother 's toxic influence on him during his childhood .
livia soprano according to sopranos wiki not sure how much stock that carries married tony 's father in an effort to alleviate herself of the impoverished household she grew up in .
johnny boy along with his brother corrado jr. was a powerful mob chieftain who wielded power over his household in the same manner he did on the streets with particularly detached pragmatism .
he viewed his wife with the same prerogative he did the gangsters in his charge which is to say an expectation of servility .
in johnny 's lifestyle made men get married and have children under the same cultural expectations accorded to smashing a debtors face in .
wives women really just people in general were a means to an end .
if livia exhibited any anti social tendencies and she certainly did it should n't be outside the context of a husband who would rather eat steak with his mistress than tend to his wife who recently miscarried .
that it warranted so little commentary that johnny 's son also grew up to be a similarly violent adulterous mobster i find very strange .

y'all act like this is the end ? ? ? ?
yea i can see the headlines now ... ... crapcom is introducing 6 more characters 3 months from the release of their game '' then the accusations of these character were already on the disc or already made but crapcom wants our money .

lately there were no developed new medicines except for the separate class sarms which effect is only studied .

i 'm thinking of this game and my mind is telling me it 's 007 racing or at least very similar .
i remember a lot of the pictures of 007 racing but i have this specific level in mind .
it was made out of differently coloured cubes sticking up i ca n't really recall the layout but i 'm fairly certain it had ramps leading up to them and bridges connecting them .
if anyone knows what i 'm speaking of and can supply me with a picture that 'd be great !
considering the uk is covered in snow at the moment i was pretty surprised to see my 5 over wintered plants sprouting leaves again .
they are all indoors on the kitchen windowsill so away from the cold .
should i just leave them to it or remove the new growth and not allow them to grow again until march time ?
my hab plant was dieing in the same place a month or so ago which is why i decided to over winter them in the first place so i 'm pretry surprised to see this happening .
is there something i should be worried about or does this look fine ?
specifically could i get into trouble by discussing above stuff ?

hello guys i came here to ask this question because after several attempts of googling the same question i keep finding either the same popular names or links to top x '' photographers which once again consists of the same names .
i tried to search through 500px but the styles that emerge at the top there are more or less the same fashion and once again the same photographers i already know .
the reason i want to ask is because after browsing some awards galleries i discovered fantastic photos from photographers i have never heard about who have huge extensive galleries with personal style unique locations etc .
so i am trying to ask here either names you are fond of or collections of galleries such as the aforementioned awards collections stuff like that .
some people like to exert the power of the laws and make such wild statements as a defence without thinking of its consequence— that such statements are technically an authorisation .
this question may seem stupid but it is n't .
practically every statement you makes matter ... at least to the police .
for example it 's ridiculous that you 've to invoke miranda rights or constitutional rights even though it 's supposedly designed to be a protocol for police and limit police authority .
but without invoking your rights it 's considered you 're volunteering to help '' to the police investigation .
— at least that 's how police view it .
so back to this if a stranger inadvertently tells me to attack him/her with hit me if you dare '' or go ahead and hit me '' is n't it 's a justified authorised punch/slap ?
just curious after reading an article with a victim responded to her threat arrogantly

i was in a relationship with my ex james '' for three years a year and a half of which we were engaged .
we broke up about a year and a half ago and i am now in a truly healthy year-long relationship with a 27m .
i am in a really good place in life right now but james has been on my mind a bit .
i think it 's because our wedding date had been set for this month so i 've been reflecting and have found myself again asking the questions i had at the end of our relationship .
i sometimes find myself getting pretty angry when i think about the situation and how much confusion i have about what i experienced .
i met james the day after i graduated high school when i was 18 and he was 20 at a party for a mutual friend .
i had heard of james before because he was the best friend of the host 's boyfriend but i had never met him because he lived in the next city over 80 minutes away .
i was morbidly obese at the time and so was he but he was cute enough and was the only person who had ever flirted with me .
the evening of the day he asked me to be his girlfriend a few days after we met we were trying to have sex in his car in the desert in my town and he suddenly starts acting different .
i ask him what was going on and he replied they call me the evil one '' and said he was someone else who lived in jame 's head .
i freak out and he had me call the mutual friend 's boyfriend for an explanation .
long story short the friend explains to me that james has multiple personalities himself and two others '' or alters '' .
i did n't think anyone would be interested in me again so i decided to keep seeing him .
i had taken psychology and knew about sybil and was a big fan of united states of tara '' during high school so i thought i knew about did/mpd and should give him a chance .
there is so much to the story of our relationship and me dealing with and managing his multiple personalities that i do n't even know where to begin .
i guess i can summarize in a list of his behaviors/symptoms/claims and things that happened in the relationship .
it turned out he had a total of about six personalities including a very young nonverbal child and one who i only met once or twice to threaten me that he 'd kill off the others .
besides james peter and clint were the two main personalities .
peter was very analytical and rational while clint was impulsive and animalistic .
clint is the one i met in the desert that first night .
peter acted as some kind of gatekeeper who could handle difficult information that james could not handle .
no matter who was out '' any of them could pretend to be james .
his family who he lived with did not know about the multiple personalities .
we only saw each other on weekends taking turns traveling to one another .
sometimes when he was james and we were having difficult conversations about our relationship he would begin to cry very hard and would abruptly stop crying and become someone else .
he had me so so so convinced of the entire scenario that i wrote about our relationship for an autobiographical assignment in a writing class which i submitted to a relationship advice site as a guest blog post .
the post was published and i was deeply hurt at the time by the comments criticizing our relationship and questioning the legitimacy of his claims .
he was able to get out of any difficult conversations he wanted at any time when he switched to another personality .
i dedicated myself completely to making sure he was as happy as i could and to keep personality drama at bay as much as possible .
i really gave a lot of love to him .
we argued but never fought or yelled at each other so i think i convinced myself that the relationship was healthier than it was .
i asked him several times point-blank to please be honest with me and tell me if it was true he had multiple personalities .
i made it clear that i would stay with him if he came clean .
he would always be hurt and i would wind up feeling terrible that i 'd questioned him .
i never felt like i could tell people outside of our immediate friend group about him .
my family still does n't know there was anything so abnormal about him .
twice or thrice he told me he 'd never ever date again if we ever broke up and would probably kill himself within a decade or so .
towards the end of our relationship i was having terrible doubts about spending my life with someone like him as much as i loved him at the time and as hard as it was to take care of him .
we got engaged at my insistence after a year and a half a month before i turned twenty .
we did plan on a three-year engagement which i am so glad for .
after we got engaged i lost over one hundred pounds and wanted him to be healthy alongside me .
he resented me hugely for this and told me he was less attracted to me .
i was lonely with our limited in-person contact and in our last few months we opened up our relationship to allow me to make out with others .
i had an encounter that went a little further than it should have .
the hookup rubbed me through my underwear and masturbated in my car .
i let it happen which was totally wrong of me but i think maybe deep down i wanted to throw a rod in things because of my fears ?
james agreed to stay together but told me he could n't trust me and peter and clint both told me they did n't love me any more and never would again .
he did things that i felt were to punish me for the rest of the relationship like withholding affection or clint having sex with me after telling me he did n't care for me .
after we broke up we did n't see each other until a couple months later at another friend 's party .
we were close that evening but i do n't think we kissed or anything do n't totally remember we might have .
and this was when he dropped the bombshell that made me wonder if i 'd been in an abusive relationship all along he admitted to lying about the multiple personalities .
i asked why he had n't told me when i begged for the truth during our relationship .
he told me it was because he was hurt i did n't believe him .
which of course i said was totally fucking ridiculous .
in the end though i was so so grateful to know the truth .
i was seeing a therapist at my university at the time i graduated this past may and had come to the realization that because i had been so significantly lied to every single day for three years that i was a victim of abuse .
i made a lot of strides coming to accept that .
some short time later he told me that what he told me at the party was the lie .
the truth was that he really did have multiple personalities .
to this day i do n't know what 's true .
my brain hunch is that of course the did was a lie but he really really really convinced me .
i think my heart still thinks it might be true .
if he did lie i think i might have been abused .
i cheated on and left someone who while not right for me regardless is in real need of help .
i have n't been in contact with james in a long time and i do n't have social media .
i plan on never speaking with him again but i am so desperate for the truth .
i 'm left not knowing if i was abused or what the truth of my first relationship was .
despite it being difficult and my deep down doubts it was a relationship that made me happy at the time .
now the thought of him kind of makes my skin crawl .
i 'm still so confused and it really gets to me a lot sometimes .
tl dr i had a difficult but happy relationship with someone who claimed he had multiple personalities .
if he lied i think i was probably abused .
if it was true then i do n't think i was .
i want to know if i am a victim of abuse or not so i can move on and really forget about him for good .

no he should not have to resign because of muddled allegations from years ago .

franken will either say moore was elected by those damn republicans so i 'm staying ! ''

like i said a man is only as good as his word ... .so franken will absolutely renege .

the point is that as long as you only know broad plot points nothing sounds amazing .
that 's why i chose hamlet if we only lay down the broadest plot points possible we might think the play sucks .
that does n't mean that it has to get better the execution of the plot development can be bad .
plot points have to be connected through details like back story character development themes etc .
all of that makes the writing good or bad .
then we have the actual filmmaking on top of that for the visual medium .
acting music scene composition cinematography pacing etc are crucial and can enhance a flawed script a lot .
that 's why book adaptions can work despite being inferior to the source material writing wise in almost every case .

i 've seen something vaguely similar with a light scattering of road salt .
the center of each had a little chunk of salt .
around the salt was a damp ring about 5 '' across .
i could imagine blowing snow sticking to the slightly damp surface but not elsewhere .
but in your case the salt may have all dissolved or maybe the cause was n't salt at all .
to truly solve the puzzle you 're going to have to lick the road .
or look closely and see if there 's still any salt-chunks left in the middles .

i did n't save scum the boss fights so that i could have a respectable fight .
although even if i did save scum them i have a feeling that the bosses had some actions be variable/reactive since after restarting some of their moves would change from what they were before .

the message is unchanged from the kitchen side but somewhat backwards on the frying pan side .
if you ca n't stand the heat you surely do n't want to jump out of the frying pan and into the fire and yet ... . clearly this is the right thing to do .

i conclude that this is excellent advice unless you follow it at which time it becomes immediately terrible .

nice thought experiment however this is a hypothetical and you simply can not argue with it .
i for instance would most definitely save 5 zygotes over one 5 yo .
however my reasons for it could not be valid .
for example saying that 5 lives are worth more than 1 is not necessarily true .
some say life is priceless so 5 lives is not worth more than 1 they would be equal .
in which case 1 zygote is equal to 5 five year-olds .
you ca n't measure the importance of a life so there is no right or wrong answer here and it should not be argued .
it 's much more likely that one 5 yo dies within say the next 5 years than all of the zygotes do especially with your given incubators .
in which case why would picking the one life be more worthwhile than multiple ?

you think 4-5 war average is the best case scenario ?
in 2014 he had a 6.5 war and a equal ops to this year .
in 2015 he was on pace for 50hr and a 7 war before his face was destroyed by a pitch .
he was still recovering from that and a different injury in 2016 but still would have put up around 4 war over the course of a full season .
basically if you remove injury time giancarlo has averaged 7ish war since 2014 .
could he put up 4-5 for the next 4 years ?
maybe but that 's insane to suggest that the guy who has put up 7 war when healthy and his injury was a freak accident ca n't do more than 5 per year .

what i find interesting about abduction phenomenon is how people seem to react to it .
hundreds of people every year claim to have been abducted often routinely often sexually assaulted and mutilated and people just sort of dismiss it .
these people work jobs pay taxes own homes and in any other circumstances stance if they told police they were being routinely abducted and assaulted an investigation would take place .
however when you say extraterrestrials are involved this gets dismissed regardless of whether or not the person is a functioning member of society otherwise .
i 'm not saying that these people are definitely being abducted by aliens but it seems bizarre to me that their claims are not taken seriously considering the gravity of their claims and the lengths many of them are willing to go to be taken serious .
it seems to me that regardless whether this is extraterrestrials or if it is a psychological phenomenon it warrants genuine investigation especially considering the number of claims .
seems almost bizarre how dismissive people are about it .

all women have different bodies and different sized/positioned reproductive organs .
that 's also the reason why some women 's bellies swell more than others in pregnancy despite their babies being born a similar size .
not sure of the exact term for this but i and the women in my family mostly have very backwards-set uteri therefore when pregnant my mother and aunts just looked much fatter without a huge amount of protrusion in their bellies .
but these guys on badwomensanatomy will never get that women are n't cookie cutter stiff fleshlights made to stroke their egos and measure their masculinity .

it 's part of why our food pyramid and food industries have essentially been conspiring to trick the public into buying their subsidized products .
fat free foods was just a marketing gimmick from the 1950s until the late 1990s in the same way gluten free is today .
google ketogenic diets and there 's a plethora of research to show that high fat diets do n't cause weight gain like you 'd think .
i 'm also annoyed that as a society we consider most calories to be equivalent to one another regardless of the composition of nutrients and minerals that they come with .
your body does n't take fat from foods and store it as fat in your own body .
it uses a process involving carbohydrate conversion in relation to insulin levels .
our entire view on nutrition needs to be radically changed .

a colostomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening stoma is formed by drawing the healthy end of the large intestine or colon through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall and suturing it into place .

it may be reversible or irreversible depending on the circumstances .

good post though i disagree with your conclusion that it wo n't be repealed in good faith .
technically it does n't matter under what faith it is repealed it is a win for consumers in the long run .
the issue you are concerned about is the short run .
this is due to them using lobbying to over regulate thus stifling smaller competitors and also the very physical and difficult infrastructural challenges currently required .
considering the negatives you stated why opt into those permanently rather than deal with the temporary negatives in the short term ?

i vaguely remember this game that you walk around and had monsters on your team that you used to fight other monsters .
your monsters looked like they were cards possibly they were also summoned ? .
the artwork was very detailed from what i remember .
you had to fight monsters enough to either catch them or kill enough to buy them as a card .
i vaguely remember a plot line where i was dropped into an underground area with mole monsters and there was a strong area with fire monsters that i could not beat so i stopped playing they looked like demon fireballs .
it was a good vs evil story but tbh i do n't remember that part of it .
i only remember the underground area and vaguely a forest both with respective villages .
i also remember having fungi dinosaur was one of my monsters on a card .
sorry that this was just a hodgepodge of info .
in ranked if you leave before you die you should be suspended from joining another game for the duration of the game you just left .
for example say i do n't like my role and leave .
if i try to join another game ranked or not i should get a message that says you are temporarily suspended until your previous game ends . ''
it 's just unfortunate for those who disconnect due to internet/network problems .
the reason early quitter should be suspended from all modes for that duration is so they do n't have the mind set that they can quit and play another game while waiting for their current one to end .
i 'm making a digital battle card game similar too hearthstone mtg ygo and etc .

i could not get a straight answer from customer care/customer service so i figured i 'd ask here .
is the sim card locked '' to the phone ?
if i take the sim out and put it in another phone will it work ?
if the sim is locked can i change it by calling customer care ?
what happens if i port out my number to another carrier during the free year ?
can i keep the sprint deal and get a new phone number from sprint ?
if i get two sim cards do i have to activate them with two separate devices ?
i love the game so far and everything feels and runs well above my expectations .
the only thing that bothers me is tap to ads .
a simple switch between ads and 3pp targeting would be fantastic .
a simple option to switch these in settings would be amazing .
everything else seems very well thought out and incredibly well implemented .

in economics gresham 's law is a monetary principle stating that bad money drives out good '' .
for example if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation which are accepted by law as having similar face value the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation .
the law was named after sir thomas gresham a sixteenth-century financial agent of the english crown in the city of antwerp to explain to queen elizabeth i what was happening to the english shilling .
her father henry viii had replaced 40 percent of the silver in the coin with base metals to increase the government 's income without raising taxes .
astute english merchants and even ordinary subjects would save the good shillings from pure silver and circulate the bad ones hence the bad money would be used whenever possible and the good coinage would be saved and disappear from circulation .
when people have a choice of which to spend and which to hoard they will tend to hoard the money that is a better money .
the problem for all forms of fiat is that they are inferior for holding .
no one wants to hold a currency that is inflating .
fiat has become a hot-potato that everyone wants to get rid of and no one wants to be left holding .
this is manifesting in the form of rapid gains across the entire cryptosphere in practically all of the leading coins .
the vast majority of people buying crypto today do not actually understand why this is happening they have only identified it as a phenomenon that has now trended in the same direction long enough for so many years that they have significant confidence it will continue to rise .
however this trend is not good news for the people that control fiat and derive a large part of their wealth and power from their ability to shift the cost of printing more money onto the population at large and thus to enrich themselves dishonestly .
note today that south korea is undertaking an emergency meeting https www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-bitcoin-southkorea/south-korea-to-hold-emergency-meeting-on-cryptocurrencies-measures-expected-friday-iduskbn1e703o to figure out what to do about cryptocurrency investing after south koreans '' discovered '' bitcoin recently and began going in deep .
cryptocurrency in all its leading forms being inherently a better money than any form of government fiat simply because it is not subject to the whims of human management and corruption is becoming a prime way for the masses to save .
this is on the doorstep to creating a viable competitor to the stock market as a way to save .
a large amount of the money now tied up in cryptocurrency undoubtedly would 've found its way into wall st. and similar traditional investment vehicles like property had cryptocurrencies not existed .
so all fiat is inferior for holding and this was good for the stock markets of the world and the property markets of the world .
this is a problem because someone has to hold fiat .
and if all the world begins trying to get out of fiat and into cryptocurrencies that has potential to creates the nightmare scenario that the state dreads above all hyperinflation as people rush to escape a failing currency and those left holding the bag last lose most .
this is why the us government is concerned about bitcoin why places like russia and china keep announcing bans or controls and then walking back on those ideas when they realize that bitcoin transactions can not be regulated by the state in any reasonable way well they could turn off the internet but that would result in open revolt of the populace rock and hard place and why south korea is concerned now .
the worst-case scenario for government is total repudiation of their currencies ala ecuador .
but at the same time the us government and many other governments have become afraid to take a hard line against new technologies because they all want to ride the wave of technological innovation and earn taxes from new industries that pop up and they would rather not chase those industries into other countries and find themselves left out of the new technological bonanza .
this also helps explain why multiple cryptocurrencies are doing well instead of just one because the leading cryptocurrencies all have the properties of a good currency better than fiat and cryptocurrencies wo n't actually have to compete strongly with each other until fiat is replaced or deprecated worldwide .
so why has btc done better than all other cryptocurrencies in terms of unit price to this date apart from inflation-arbitrage .
it 's primarily because of mindshare and exposure and good-press .
think of btc as being to cryptocurrency what aol was to the internet in the 90 's .
at that time aol had created its own walled-garden and was on-boarding large numbers of people into using the internet in a safe and idiot-friendly way while offering none of the power-features of the real internet .
for the purposes of this analogy bitcoincash is the real internet of the 90 's .
and while massive numbers of people got into the internet for the first time through using aol it was n't long before they realized they lived in a walled garden and the real thing was on the other side of that wall and the whole world ultimately made the jump to the real internet .
that is why so many of us think btc will do well in the short-term as people are on-boarding into cryptocurrency through btc but that in the long-term people will begin to realize that bch is the real thing and why are we bothering to put up with the aol of cryptocurrencies when this other thing bch works so much damn better ?
and value will begin leaking out of btc and into bch especially as use cases for bch begin to multiply and an ecosystem of use-cases are built on top of bch as a platform .
and bch devs are wisely keeping the use-cases as wide open as possible that allows path-dependence effects to stay wide-open as well allowing that ecosystem to grow .
an ecosystem that the btc-core devs have already destroyed strangling the baby in its crib btw .
so in the same way that we had to educate the masses about cryptocurrency in general it is now our task to explain to them why bitcoincash is where focus needs to be going forward .
honestly the hard work of validating the cryptocurrency concept is already done now the job is to compete within the class and we have every advantage .
there was a time in the distant past when her insomnia would spur her to wake me up for some drowsy mid-night sex which was awesome and seemed to help her get to sleep after .
now what she does instead is pick up my phone not hers mine and starts launching apps looking for ...
in some sense i think she 's looking for trouble .
sometimes she 'll find something she does n't like in an email or a text message between me and a friend or a family member and in the morning she 'll complain about what someone said to me or why are you talking about subject x with person y that 's none of their business and you should talk to me about it instead . ''
in the worst of cases she 'll mix what she finds with a heavy dose of dark fantasy concoct a ridiculous conspiracy or situation designed to hurt her and wake me up screaming about it .
other times the times she finds nothing to object to she does n't say anything .
but she leaves the trail of recently launched apps on my phone so it 's not hard to see what she 's doing .
last night was one of those and this morning i could see that after the last app i used before bed last night she had launched about twenty different apps to try to find some communications to be upset about .
messages hangouts slack skype meetup steam mail plus a bunch of other random apps .
she 's been doing this now and then for at least a year .
each thing that she 's found to get upset about are either just normal conversations where she finds something to dislike which is her reaction to many conversations irl too or something where she finds something that is completely outside of my control like me receiving spam or receiving an email receipt for a hotel booking that someone with a name similar to mine had accidentally sent to my gmail address and spins it into an incredible story about me .
her snooping always happens at night and this fact that during times when she used to come closer to me she now instead chooses to look for ways to drive a wedge between us makes it extra sad .

i 've been a lurker on this sub and i decided to get a pair of shoes .
i received an email today that my shoes came in and were delivered my shoes .
i could n't find them anywhere outside my home and i think that someone stole them .
i bought the shoes from goat and used ups tracking .
so today our concert band had out christmas concert and the jazz instuctor at my school says i want you to check out a bass trombone ...
i think you 're the guy for it '' and this instructor has a certain way of making people feel slightly obliged to doing jazz .
now he did n't ask me to play bass bone in jazz but i think he may want me to once i get the hang of bass bone
the issue is i am a tenor bone player and i like smaller i prefer to play higher and prefer to fiddle with smaller instruments than larger when i play things like tuba my mouth gets all slobbery and on top of that i cant read anything below a low g the last note on the line
so how would i get more comfortable into the lower range ?
how do i not run out of air after 4 counts ?
and how would ya 'll go about learning those lower ledger lines
currently playing divinity 2 but gon na hold off until they add some fixes/changes
some of the final fantasies most were meh too me .
i dont want another game focused on grinding gear end game .
i only know of steam and not sure what other platforms hold a lot of rpgs .
trying to prevent scratches after my experience with the psvr .

that makes 300 batches of gingerbread cookies made and handed out .
it 's a great feeling seeing the looks on the children 's faces when they receive a big bundle of cookies and dig in then run home to share .
now if you 'll excuse me i need to file my inventory reports .
we somehow have a massive surplus of sugar and the town 's water supply is depleting despite the new aque blastia .
i 'll write up a proposal for a better inventory system .
the taint tracker forums went online a few months back and were supposed to kinda be like the school survival forums .
but one day i went onto the site and it was just closed .
whenever he uses the messenger app to send pictures its getting zoomed in .
unlike of he uses the camera app of the phone and attache it via messnger it works fine .

i 've run out of gifts with nothing left for the saviors !
as a knight it is my duty to serve the people .
i 'll contact my superiors in the imperial knights and see what they can do .
in the meantime if you have any gifts to share your work would be greatly appreciated by the empire !

she glanced to him and felt some relief that he at least had survived combat .
following his eyes she watched as he opened his palm to reveal a pair of small comms devices he kept in case of an emergency .
he quietly motioned for her and zeego to put one on .
listening intently they could hear the chatter over the audio feed .
a reserve force had been dispatched by command and were planning to intercept them in the air .
however they had run into issues with navigating through earth 's defense .
they 'd fallen behind and it was becoming clear a new plan was in order .
axtur worked his maw for a moment and then regurgitated something into his palm again .
they were getting out of here one way or the other .
hey ... is he okay over there ? vic asked tom lowly .
yeah i think that 's just a noise he makes. tom said as he thought of the report .
he got a translator and atmos like anyone else but he has n't spoken a word since he was brought in .
yeah see now ... vic spoke again softly those are the ones to watch.
tom and dozer both nodded in agreement as they began focusing heavily on re-entry .
ya 'll better sit back this one might get a little bumpy. dozer cautioned as he checked the ship 's hud .
everybody knew when to be serious at some point .
nothing will get resolved if they burn up in the atmosphere on the way down .
zeego tightened his grip as the ship began to shudder and buffet against the forces outside .
jorge and axtur met each other with a hateful glance on a whim as if to say the feeling was mutual if this was it .
tom requested to hinx what 's our temp reading ? ''
hinx replied heat shields are holding at normal readings . ''
dozer mentioned as he stayed fixated on the controls .
as the craft reached a safer part of the atmosphere everyone had grown quiet watching as the earth loomed outside .
the large expanse of blue curving away from them .
because everyone on the mastadon seems to have a different nickname for you . ''
he 'd had to explain this more than he 'd like to admit to multiple people .
well c'mon man do n't leave me hanging . ''
it translates to a variety of things in gu-sean .
in your language war '' is my first name .
my last name gets you lizard '' dragon '' reptile '' ... and so on .
depending on the language you could call me any of those . ''
yoshi ... '' val absently spoke from her gun position .
i mean yoshi is pretty dope. dozer theorized he literally eats his enemies .
just ‘cause he lays eggs does n't make him a terrible character.
i mean he 's able to do all that while some plumbers high on shrooms ride him like a horse while punching him in the head. tom added .
he literally put the team on his back though. dozer laughed .
they could feel a stare burning into their necks and glancing saw hinx locked completely on them in anger .
... so does it really mean yoshi ? lynx prodded .
stop it. hinx commanded as the others snickered nearby .
mer'zazzi checked out the window and had to do a double take .
through the bizarre weather of the planet the sky cleared again .
before them stretched an endless city one the size of which she 'd never seen before in her life .
massive buildings some distance away seemed to meet the skies themselves masses of light and writing gracing the exteriors .
how many of them are down there she had to wonder .
her questions were soon answered as she noted the swarms of aircraft identical to the one they were riding in .
some of them landing like theirs others taking off and more just sitting in rows waiting .
it was as if they had an endless supply .
they touched down slowly on a massive landing zone and the ship 's motors settled to a low hum .
welcome to kitty hawk. tom greeted to no one in particular .
sure. dozer agreed as he flicked various switches and buttons .
tom and his crew directed the others off the ship and into the sunlight .
mer'zazzi and the others could only try to survey their surroundings the best they could .
while it was n't exactly difficult to walk the gravity was clearly somewhat stronger on this planet than her own .
as the armed group motioned them down a large set of stairs towards the surface she got a sinking feeling that whatever sk'al had originally planned this was not it .
axtur nodded again to her as they reached the bottom of the stairs .
on that cue she palmed the small cutter he 'd given her on the ship .
they have reached the surface ahead of our estimates. sk'al began what is your status ?
this change of plan chilled him to his very core .
commander c'lorte do not engage the humans in combat .
if it is a fight the humans want we will give it to them.
dozer had just about finished shutting down main power when a lock-on warning suddenly flashed across the screen .
the alarm began slowly chiming up to speed ... . dozer instinctively snapped off his harness sprinted out of his seat staggered out the door and took off at a dead run .
behind him he briefly registered a shriek rising overhead .
no i did n't die from excessive eggnog this weekend .
nearly od 'd on pancakes but that 's another story .
i 'm not due for more driving until a few days from now .
i think we 've been overlooking an obvious choice for potus in a tww reboot .
when we 're introduced to him he can already politically maneuver like a pro at 24 years old 2004
he 's kinda slippery but he 's young when we meet him .
he 'd just be old enough to be potus but it works paired with a leo-type as vpotus .
i think it would be compelling to see how the youngest operates .
relatively a blank canvas for sorkin to let loose on .
is anyone here getting weird transaction names when using apple pay on bus/tube ?
yesterday i used the tube and bus and got a transaction in the name of finetex creative and last week i got another one ellie edmonds mezzo soprano .
the others have been called tfl travel charge the usual
on the bank statement it shows tfl charge for all
no sooner do i get an important mission to help out the santa association then yuri goes running off on some odd holiday mission .
i literally ca n't understand what he 's even up to this time but he should know to leave this to the imperial knights .
i suppose he might be helping out another guild .
i 'll have to place my confidence in him but he could learn to ask for some help ... sigh at least you all know to count on friends right ?
we do n't even know if there 'll be a fourth season i 'm fully aware we all understand this .
but assuming it does happen there 's a chance it will cover a lot more story potentially 24 episodes .
which means it may take long enough that erina gets her original actress back in time hopefully she took way longer than normal to recover and it got a lot of us worried .
no disrespect to her replacement but risa taneda is erina and it 's gon na be great to have her come back no matter how long it takes .
some of erina 's best moments come right after the current arc in the anime .
in classification tasks i can use the class score as a measure of the network confidence .
if the network classifies an image as a cat with 0.99 score then the network has high confidence in its prediction compared to an image with a 0.60 score .
is there a similar mechanism to assess the confidence of a regression output ?
say i 'm building a model to predict the temperature from location and time of year .
there are areas where the weather is fairly stable and there are areas where the weather changes every day .
the network should be able to catch these patterns and output a confidence '' score in addition to the regressed temperature value .
i think we all know what that would do for volumes .
it 's no doubt brilliant tech but newcomers buying the coin because it 's the cheapest on coinbase definitely helped cause the parabolic increase as of recent .
would it be weird to gift s guy i 've been hanging out with not in an official relationship yet for the past two months a small christmas gift ?
i 'm 22 live in belgium and i 've been working for a year now .
i do n't come from a lot of money which means i 've been building a life from 0 .
now i 'm starting to get financially stable and i have the liberty to set some money aside .
right now i 'm putting €100/month into a pension plan .
that leaves me with roughly another €400 to invest or save .
one of my biggest concerns is being able to buy a house in the future .
i believe this means i need €35.000 to start a loan .
is there a way i can get this money within the next 6 to 8 years ?
aside from just plain saving €500/month over the next 6 years .
hi long time member on a throw away account .
i 'm founder of a startup company put lot of own money and time in to it .
the company was doing pretty good it was almost profitable .
vcs decided to screw it up they hired a new ceo who brought his own crew .
i was let go from the company which now is going through a recapitalization .
the new crew issued themselves a giant option pool and bonuses .
the film is seven and a half hours from being released here and i 'm four and half away from sitting down and watch the force awakens !
i need some help to pass the time.. cascon do your thing !
we moved here in june after my husband was laid off from his i.t .
we had checked las vegas out last january and liked what we saw so flew back to texas downsized our life and came back in june .
he has applied to a multitude of jobs for a multitude of positions and has gotten nowhere .
experience yes we are an older couple plus a lot of additional software and c.s .
he is overqualified for most of the jobs he applies for and the two jobs he got a call back on tells him that he is not a good fit for their company .
we think it is probably an age factor but obviously they can not say that .
we love the area and want to stay but 6 months of this is really wearing on him .
i do n't post much i prefer lurking but am hoping some of you might have some ideas we have n't thought of .
1 there were times i did n't even want to smoke but i did anyway .
2 there were times i felt i needed to smoke .
if this resonates with anyone and helps them with the addiction then i 'm glad .
there are so so so so many other benefits in quitting .
but those were the two things that really got to me .
edit u/danisunoriginal has belittled my problem in the comments and asked for an ms paint file to legitimize my problem .
hopefully the rest of r/legaladvice is a little less judging ... this is a real problem effecting my day to day life .
so i 've lived in the same apartment for a little over 3 years .
i 'm on a year to year lease and have a pretty good relationship with the management and have never had a problem with neighbors the complex anything .
6 months ago i had a couple move in next to us we share a common wall of the building .
since they first moved in loud music has been a problem .
i can hear loud music and loud conversation when i 'm in the kitchen bathroom and bedroom closet .
loud enough and clear enough that i can hear every word of every song and 90 of the verbal communication between the couple when they 're fighting .
fortunately i work nights and their 'loud ' times line up to times when i 'm not usually there .
they 're loud in the late morning 9-11am and the late evening 11pm-1am which are times that i 'm typically not in a part of the apartment where i 'm bothered .
it 's always been a 'thing ' for the last 6 months or so but been easy to ignore .
the music was really loud all hours of the day and the arguments got hard to ignore .
i heard threats to kill eachother threats of violence against others loud sounds of crashing and things smashing against the wall etc .
i called the management of my complex and they told me they would put the complaint on record and suggested i contact my city 's non emergency line .
the non emergency line operator was super cool and within 20 minutes there was an officer here .
within 20 more minutes 6 cars showed up people went to jail and everything was cool for a week .
i do n't know what happened who was arrested or why .
no noise from the neighbors not a single bass rumble through the walls no arguments through the vents nothing at all .
loud music after 2am a lot of arguing throughout the day i 've heard stuff like 'fuck you ' 'i 'll kill you ' 'ill beat the shit out of him/her/you ' .
i 've called the non emergency line the last two nights to report this both nights around 2am .
i creep through the windows and multiple officers show up and within 30 minutes they leave and the music/arguments stop .
this is obviously the best solution but after an arrest 2 weeks ago and 2 nights in a row of police response i do n't see this stopping ... i feel like i 'm wasting my time ?
i do n't know what to do if this happens again tomorrow .
can i ask the police what is going on ?
should i just keep calling the non emergency line ?
i do n't want to get in the crosshairs of what appear to be crazy neighbors but i want it to stop .
if we reduce inequality will the middle class and poor necessarily benefit ?
i should be seven weeks pregnant i had an emergency ultrasound yesterday .
because of the way the practices work i have no doctor .
my first ob appointment is n't until january and they apparently do n't see emergency visits in the ob office anymore .
so i had to take my bleeding crying self into labor and delivery with my two-year-old .
my husband is out of the country and they told me to come in immediately .
they referred me to the outpatient imaging clinic ... as i ca n't be seen in labor and delivery .
i do n't know who you talked to they were wrong .
ok. can you write lab orders to have blood to check my hcg levels drawn ?
you can go to the er not at this facility .
did i mention i have a high deductible health care plan ?
did i mention how pointless it is to go to the er for a blood test ?
they told me to go to labor and delivery .
i ended up calling my general practitioner and she wrote me a lab order for two hcg draws .
they would n't accept it at the hospital labs so i had to make an appointment at labcorp to get it drawn .
my gp made me an appointment to be seen in office on friday but she does n't have an ultrasound machine .
is it just ... too much to ask to speak to a doctor at my practice if i 'm miscarrying ?
i do n't even know who to call when the blood results come back .
i have miscarried before in a different city and they were able to see me at my ob/gyn clinic .
i came back at around 190 gear score and am up to 270 now .
if i have a good piece of gear set at like 230 can i optimize it up or would it be better to find the same piece at a higher gear score ?

it is a 2 bed 2 bath and rent is 824 a month with included parking and all unlimited utilities .
it 's located right on apache and mcclintock and is about a 5 minute walk to the light rail .
the entire apartment is fully furnished and the bedroom comes with a bed mattress desk side table and dresser .
you 'd be living with 1 other female roommate a senior who also attends asu .
the lease goes until july and i would also cover your first month of rent for free .
if interested please pm me for more details/further contact !
i already made a post about yelich but we have other holes that need to be filled and other teams are talking about possible firesales .
he has either 5/86 or 6/94 remaining on his contract .
there 's a 13m team option for 2023 when he 'll be 37 .
yelich was relatively easy to project entering his prime but what about players leaving their prime ?
longoria would be playing for us from the age of 32-37 .
baseball reference says he 's most similar to aramis ramirez eric chavez and ryan zimmerman for his last four seasons so i 'll average their careers to try and project longoria .
zimmerman and chavez did n't play until age 37 so i 'll take the next similar 3b scott rolen .
age gp ab r h 2b hr rbi sb bb so ba obp ops ops dwar bwar
if we add that on to his career totals here are some career numbers he would end up with .
however we only really care about his time here .
this is looking good as far as prospects go .

this move seems to be spooking retail investors more than anything or maybe they were expecting a more positive result and the current price has hit a 1 month support level .

i recently got a new lg 4k hdr tv and it works great apart from that it outputs optical only .
at the moment i am using a device that converts optical to stereo rca for my 10 year old speaker system .
so i would like to ask for your advice on buying a new sound system to go with my tv .
only this time i hope to go for a 5.1 setup that does great quality for a good price .
i have looked at sound bars but i feel it may not be effective as i have plenty of room on my left side .

virtual cabin 2.0 is coming in the next update to friday the 13th the game !
the new virtual cabin is an expansion and complete overhaul of the original that we launched prior to release of the full game on pc .
for those unfamiliar the virtual cabin is a combination museum to friday the 13th the game and an interactive dev diary !
2.0 is far larger in scope not only with information and accessibility but it includes far more than meets the eye if you
well ... ... we 've added a ton of stuff hidden below the surface .
the secrets in the updated virtual cabin are completely new .
the more you explore the more you 'll discover and the more everything becomes clear to you .
the virtual cabin is not what it seems and it will take everything you have to unlock its secrets .
our team is really looking forward to seeing just how long it takes everyone to play through the full experience .
that said virtual cabin 2.0 is a complete re-imaging of our first iteration and it has been completely upgraded to be more challenging and far more expansive .
keep plugging away because nothing is what it seems and there is so much to discover .

every time hr or a recruiter talks to me i always get asked if i 'm a u.s. citizen or i need a visa sponsorship or something else .
on my resume it specifically says on the top that i 'm a citizen and when you apply on any job portal you also specify your residency status .
so just because i 'm curious if this is just an industry standard white people do you get asked if you 're a citizen need a visa sponsorship or any other questions of these lines ?

this is the weirdest assignment i 've taken and possibly the most dangerous .
this includes my time in the military as a public affairs specialist and then later on a combat photojournalist .
a new world had been discovered but most importantly it was a world with human like creatures .
it had become one of the biggest news topic of the decade possibly the century .
every country that could was studying the planet and it 's inhabitants .
thousands of satellite passes a few atmosphere drones and less than a dozen on the ground rovers provided the data needed to get the green light for a manned mission .
scientist across the spectrum a few anthropologist myself as essentially camera guy and a couple other vets that would act as security .
i decided to hang out mostly with the other vets as me made the trip .
after what felt like an eternity we had begun to orbit this strange new world .
we landed at night and made camp on a large plateau .
while the scientist set up the camp i went with the anthropologist to begin our observation .
one of the vets lent me an extra rifle for protection .
we walked till the sun was well up and then we finally made visual contact with the unique inhabitants of this new world .
slinging the rifle i drew out my camera and started taking pictures .
i know i set it up as a bit of sci-fi but i 'm willing to change it for more terrestrial adventures .
i wanted to have fun world building before going down more lusty fun .
you can get as creative as you want for the local people .
i 'm open from humans to fantasy to anthropomorphic aliens to even furry bonus for this .
and for those that made it this far here is your reward .
a lot of people seem to dismiss the new set mods as unimportant or are less useful than the regular versions that we already have but in hindsight all them are incredibly useful to newer players .
all the set mods are incredibly cheap in terms of mod capacity costing only around 7 or 9 each .
the augur set gives very important stat bonuses like power range duration and base damage that new players are desperately trying to get their hands on .
the gladiator mods are even a fairly decent and cheap substitute for the blood rush body count combo .
thankfully the mods drop very often in low level bounty missions early in the game which gives newer players time to experiment with their builds and understand what each stat does .
granted the set mods are not as powerful as older mods like stretch and intensify but they still give very good stat increases for very little mod capacity .
the fact that their bonuses stack with older mods make them still relevant to older players who are looking for more maximization in their builds .
i 've personally been using augur message and augur reach in the majority of my builds nowadays .
the set mods have been a great addition to warframe and certainly helps smooth the struggles newer players have in getting decent mods .
but the augur set bonuses should really be buffed a little just sayin '
i have been looking for ways to practice doing tarot readings and wanted to try out some of the live-streaming platforms to do group reads .
i 'm just wondering if anybody has any experience doing reads in this or similar settings and could provide any tips including
how to respond to chat messages and tailor the reads
how to promote streams i 'm totally new to all these platforms maybe i should reach out to the live-streaming communities
i 'm going to try my first reading for tonight at 8:30 on twitch if anybody wants to tune in and give me feedback .
i suspect it 'll be a little awkward so no promises on quality !
does anyone have a list of things they take out with them ?
i usually do n't want to leave the house unless i am 100 confident in my seal so that 's only been a couple of times since i 've been discharged from hospital .
one of those times i had a leak at my work 's christmas party so i left and got an uber without saying goodbye to anyone !
i 'm only 3 weeks post op and was wondering if anyone else takes things out with them .
not so much things to leave in the car/work but going out to social things/meals and whatnot .
the current appliances i 'm on is the coloplast sensura mio flex 2 piece with the brava protective seal .
i 'm creating a template to compare 2 worksheets to be used many times by many people .
tab a is last years data tab b is this years data tab c is the differences between them and some summary statistics .
can i restrict the copy/paste function in tab a and tab b to only allow paste values '' as to avoid unwanted linking of multiple workbooks added named ranges different cell formatting etc ?
not everyone is going to read the instructions tab to know to do this and i do n't want to create something that will ultimately be rendered useless by anyone but me .
just wanted to thank the reddit community here because you guys are lovely and i always feel welcome here and also thank neopets for just always being an awesome stress reliever .
it 's perfect for when i 'm taking a break from working on work because the last couple of weeks in the semester for a business major at a school that prides itself on its business program is absolute hell and i 'm ready for christmas .
but buying plushies for my gallery playing games customizing my pets and chatting with you guys always helps and i 'm so glad i got back into neo .

all of the positive impact of obergefell aside from shoehorning a postmodern definition of marriage into constitutional law could have been accomplished just as easily through civil unions which have had 85 popular support for over a decade .
because separate and equal '' has had such a stellar track record when talking about a marginalized minority group right ?
joint-filing taxes and hospital visits were never the point .
the point was leverage in the legal system leverage to do stuff like hunt down heretics and bankrupt them .
yeah i 'm gon na make a post about this .
we were trying to get you fired up to get out the vote and for once not to concede your state to the worst it has to offer .
you 're so mistaken lol r3 was contractually obligated to make some moves and never followed through but then wanted the incentives as if they had .
you have no idea what you 're talking about dude .
anime s mami got three heads instead of one .
it takes discipline but if you seriously think of the end goal it will work out easier .
losing fat is an easy premise you are going to force your body to use the energy it has saved up ... even when it is angry at you for doing so !
lmao its also wmaf the ones that produce the most asian looking hapas .
i seen white guys claim their hapa kids dont look asian at all when in reality they look very asian .
his son looks mixed but more asian than white and his wife his fat and not very attractive despite his hotasianwife claim .
it might look good and dramatic in the movie but it seems like a bad precedent to set .
force ghosts being able to interact with the physical world leaves the door open to a lot of jumping the shark nonsense that you do n't have to worry about otherwise .
department of moral salubrity and enforcement or some other federal creation .
penalties would be dependent on context ranging from minor and reasonable fines to imprisonment or public corporal punishment .
for example maybe a 20 fine for just wearing a bra in public to imprisonment for wearing hateful and inciteful clothing especially anti-christian .
a communist t-shirt or something would call for a public lashing and forced wailing of regret and contrition by the perpetrator .
bits makes no sense at all and what happens when you need to divide them too .
i like to think i 'm actually somewhere between awkward and a sexual deviant .
it 's a deep blue district but i do n't see his son getting the seat .
it will be a democrat but that wo n't appoint his son that 's not to say he wo n't win the election if he ran but i think it 's unlikely he would win the primary .
the detroit free press was running articles calling for him to resign and it 's fairly far left as far as newspapers go and they do n't seem inclined to push for his son or nephew to get the seat from what i have seen .

but honestly watching the actual movie man on the moon is far much better with trying to understand both andy in real life and jim in his character study .
this movie touches more on carrey 's acting rather than the kaufman story ... which of course ... as you know is the point ...
even when the shots not falling he still puts in a consistent effort
thank you so much this kind comment is incredibly refreshing .
if your computer can run it gta v with family friendly mod !
it 's amazing and super fun the mod takes away any violence swearing nudity etc .
and lets you quickly switch cars with the press of a button .
really fun for just driving around and exploring and since the traffic lights work trying to drive by following traffic rules can also be a fun challenge .
they can do what they want is private property .
they could tow your car and force you to pay the towing company 250 if they wanted to .
so what your saying is i can sacrifice all my material possessions in exchange for pack luck ?
but is banning the machines the right thing or is it going over the top ?
i do n't play pokies and could n't care less if they were banned or remained and while there 's people whos lives are ruined by them theres also people who enjoy them .
my grandmother was one of these people she limited what she spent but it gave her an activity she enjoyed i do n't know how but it did .
the impact of the job losses are probably less than the impact of pokies .
surely before banning them outright we should have completed some research to clarify this .
time for a new profile type about support '' in the url bar the refresh firefox '' in the top right corner .
oh so it seems like you are ignorant of the facts then .
using language that offends white people is n't inherently racist '' any more than any other group taking offense is automatically racist .
the fact that she was referencing certain offended white people in no way makes it a general statement about whites as a whole .
i 'm not a fan of her phrasing but calling that racist '' is just as hysterical as pretending that shepherd is automatically transphobic '' .
surely you can see how a student union vp publicly telling those who disagree with her fuck you all '' and then disparaging white people is a bit different than a ta showing a relevant video ?
no an off the cuff remark in her capacity as a private citizen in no way relates to the actions of someone who was held accountable for work they did while acting as an employee of an organization .
one of those is accountable for what they say and you 're wrong about which .
absolutely none whatsoever actually unless you claim that a paid employee has less accountability to their employer than any random student should face .
you see almost no one argues that free speech means that there should be no consequences for any speech .
that 's a complete strawman since nobody is taking that position in any way .
it 's a matter of whether or not institutions should be empowered to discipline any student who does anything that offends someone .
if you think they should you ca n't complain about either case .
and people think that it 's ok for someone to be disciplined if you 're a student union vp and tell people fuck you all '' and insult their race .
those people would be called hypocrites '' when they claim universities are places where offensive stances should be aired .
you 're simply proving that you want views that offend you to be censored .
her statement was no more insulting a race than peterson was claiming trans identities are subhuman .
they also think it 's not ok for a ta to be told she 's committing gendered violence '' and all the other crap that was spewed in the meeting simply for showing a benign video that was aired on public television .
since literally the only complaint about that discussion is clumsy wording of some explanations and zero consequences or any other threats beyond asking to see material prior to presentation in the future pretending that 's somehow censorship is a truly novel definition of the word .
perhaps employees should never have any responsibility to any supervisor for what they 're paid to teach but you 'd have to build a far stronger case than anything you 've proposed so far .
maybe you should learn to deal with offensive speech '' with a little more maturity yourself and stop being sheltered from opinions you dislike ?
yes because that 's the relevant source on her stances regarding the incidents in question .
anyway it 's clear that you are uninformed about the situation .
the standard response of someone who thinks that people informed about the situation who disagree with them ca n't possibly really '' understand it .
i 'm not surprised you 'd use such a hollow argument but it 's still no more effective now than it ever was .
anti-jokes derive humor called anti-humor from punchlines that subvert the expectation of what humor should be like .
what 's worse than finding a worm in your apple ?
the first is funny because to get to the other side '' is so obvious and the expectation is of something more substantial while the second is funny because of a total difference of scale .
the fact that both answers are true is not why they 're funny though they do take the humor into anti-joke territory .
and here 's the important bit anti-jokes actually still have to be funny .
if your anti-joke makes no attempt at actually being funny it 's not an anti-joke .
and sadly this very post is an example of that .
let 's say you have 3 guys you can upgrade and only 1 is a smackdown guy .
you upgrade your sd guy get your 1000 points and therefore 100 santa hats .
next week if there 's a general 1:1 talent up you 'll end it at 2000 by upgrading the two other guys you 'll only hit the first milestone .
if you wait to upgrade the sd guy until then you 'll end at 3000 and get 200 more hats .
as someone who enjoys the night time i 'm okay with this .
yeah one of the other timers i was talking about ...
at the very minimum we would n't even be able to reach that end time due to maintenance being two hours prior but that timer while being aligned with the events for previous vas was more to keep track with server reset time aka not coded to be a shorter duration on the last day .
again i fully understand your frustration and can see where all this confusion is coming from .
it 's hard to tell how gumi would address this if they even deemed it necessary enough in the first place .

id have to disagree on all of your points .
first mazda still has the miata the official best car of all time and the new 6 and 3 are really fun to drive .
honda civics are really fun cars especially if you get the si .
as to your last point having driven both the above cars and luxury german cars i can confidently say that in 99 of circumstances the difference in drive quality is negligible if not skewed towards the japanese cars .
quality in german cars is different than drive quality .
what you pay for in a bmw or mercedes over other brands is fit and finish .
often times their cars feel dead and soul-less because of this .
if you enjoy driving for the sake of driving the quality difference between a bmw and a honda is n't nearly as noticeable .
there 's really nothing a local chinese person could n't do that you could for much less salary .

if anyone is wondering how this ended cena was sentenced to three months in prison for assault .
although this situation is extremely tragic and unfortunate i think this sentence is fair .
cena should n't have followed o'brian and confronted him but what occurred after that was on o'brian and his death was somewhat of a freak occurrence .
this is simply a mistake followed by self defense .

imma just throw this out here blood warden does n't really synergize with remember me as well as you might think .
if you 're using blood warden you want them to open the gate so you can stop them from leaving but if they see you 're using remember me they might try and play around blood warden .
personally i like to use remember me/noed/ruin/iron grasp could swap for agitation or even bbq if you really want .
however if you really do want to run blood warden i 'd recommend using blood warden/noed/bbq or ruin iron grasp .

i want to chime in here about only being told the backup seed one time .
i memorized it and then burned the written copy .
later i got my 2nd ledger in the mail and tried to initialize it to the same wallet as my 1at ledger and it failed .
apparently i did n't write or memorize the 24 words correctly .
i still had access to my 1st ledger because i still knew the pincode .
but i explored the menus and realized it wo n't tell me the 24 word mneumonic again even though i could still successfully access it .
i had to send all funds from my 1st ledger to my new 2nd one in which i recorded the 2nd one 's mneumonic more carefully .
then i tested the 2nd mneumonic by resetting the 1st ledger to be just like the 2nd .

eh i would n't worry about it to much .
noobs need a good ass kicking if they 're going to learn anything about the game ...
its about the comments they left about the server ! !

i think the whole theory of strict liability and even more so absolute liability in torts is stupid .
to say that some things by their very nature are dangerous or some animals are dangerous while true completely negates one of the most basic premises of tort law which is action by the party or their agent which can be seen to either intentionally inflict harm or create a duty which if breached will cause the harm .
agency requires a contractual relationship and this requires intentional acts by the defendant in extending their liability .
clearly ca n't do this to a product or animal so i see the policy desire we do n't want dumb acts by defendants to be excused because there is not a clear contractual relationship between actor animal product and defendant .
this is easily resolved by placing all the possible strict/absolute liability claims under a theory of negligence or recklessness .
it is wanton disregard for the safety of others to purchase deadly animals .
however we also believe that there are some precautions that can be taken when considering the increased risk of harm that should be enough to absolve some fault by defendants .
strict/absolute liability says no there is no amount of precaution possible to prevent harm . ''
i think under a negligence theory the best solution would be to consider the actions by defendant all the way from purchase/manufacture/design of animal or product to harm and determine if the casual connection can be made between the actions by defendant and the harm caused .
the ownership of a dangerous thing seems to create a general duty to all that could be effected to provide reasonable care .
there are definitely instances where this duty is not breached but it does n't matter under strict liability and i do n't like that .
if it is breached i think the causation/foreseeability is obvious so it does n't really bother me to think that there may be instances where a defendant is held not liable even though the ownership creates a very heightened risk .
idk but the lesson i learned is that marlon is the truth .

you 're literally too stupid to understand that the defense budget is n't just the united states military .
it 's subsidies to allied nations it 's national security it 's border protection it 's construction it 's nuclear maintenance it 's personnel expenditures like food/housing etc .
if you have a problem with the budget get both parties to cut the pork because both parties do it while pointing fingers at the other .
i just prefer jay z 's discography over nas .
illmatic is obviously ducking amazing and iww is great but he does n't have much else that i personally enjoy anywhere close to those two albums .
meanwhile for jay he has 4 albums that i love which are reasonable doubt the black album blueprint and 4:44. and by the way the black album and blueprint are better than any album nas dropped after illmatic

nutrition is key and a calorie deficit that low is not only bad for you but its setting you up for failure .
you need to eat 2-300 cals under maintenance '' .
download my fitness '' app from under armour and that should help .
have a small calorie deficit and the rest of the deficit make it come out of a workout routine .
i would also like to bring light to a part of this which is often overlooked the extent of limitations on the web can and almost certainly will be completely arbitrary .
it 's not just bandwidth intensive sites which may have trouble starting it 's any site down to the smallest blog even if it has next to no impact on a telecom 's actual operating costs .
a scenario in which this could happen would be if telecoms introduced a tiered pricing system which includes at the low level specific established sites which the user can access .
tier one 100/mo any site with no throttling on bandwidth intensive sites
tier two 75/mo any site with throttling on bandwidth intensive sites which do not pay for a fast lane ''
tier three 30/mo access to all your favorite websites cheap !
current standard connectivity prices will apply to the bottom tier and the upper tiers which are equivalent to what we have now will be for power users '' willing to spend more money .
this means that if your site is n't established now it will be at a severe disadvantage because it is literally impossible to obtain viewership from a majority of people who ca n't afford to be able to view your website .
in the long run this stunts the growth of the internet and turns it into something completely different than it is now a forum for a certain few companies to market to users and little else .
i would think reloading would take precedence over picking up loot .

i have no idea what our shared knowledge base is and i made no assumptions .
affirmative action to address a symptom of unknown etiology is like giving someone antibiotics for a runny nose .
you can guarantee that the treatment will result in a change in the amount of bacteria in their body but it wo n't kill a virus or address an allergy .
if you give someone a laxative because they have n't pooped in 3 days without checking to see if they 've eaten in that same time period then you are not solving a problem you are shooting in the dark .
i mean did you restart splice and if that did n't work restart your computer ?

essentially when the child breathes fresh air they are self insured .
for me it was 6k for the wife and 3k for the kid .
yeah that is right close to 10k to have my son .

i recently bought a pair of their japanese selvedge 19.8oz denim they said it was a limited run hand sewn in thailand .
pay was great until i realized i was putting it all right back into my car .
not to mention the other sorts of maintenance and repairs .
usually running ones cost around 60-80 grand since the charger is really desirable .
i have bought digital painting courses and found them very helpful .
they generally cover topics covered in the free videos in a lot more detail with more excercises to follow .
definitely worth it if you are learning digital drawing but if you are doing traditional drawing on paper and pencil i would follow the free videos or the artfundamentals reccomendation posted earlier
i ca n't tell if this is based on something similar he 's actually said in the past or is just complete satire .
didnt alabama 's supreme court tell everyone it was cool to destroy ballots ?
nope it 's because trump'ism was a wave that rushed over america and quickly dissipated .
the energy whatever it was and however it was generated crashed onto the shore .
whatever people saw in trump and whatever energy they threw at him to enrage liberals prove a point or rock the system is gone .

we know of it due to chronicle vol 2 .
no where in the in game lore was it hinted at that a titan had anything to do with the indirect creation of the orcs and ogres .
this is like us humans respecting a being who created the neanderthals .
homo-sapiens evolved from neanderthals but we are no longer neanderthals .
agrammar did not create the orcs he created grond .
would the orcs have existed with out grond no of course not .
aggrammar would not even know he is responsible for the orcs .
he made a big living mountain to fight a big living jungle and what happend after that he did not care for or else he would have returned .
think the zombie would look a lot better with a different colour outline instead of black
forget to mention the source i was in the sae aerodesign team at my university i remember how fascinated i was comparing aerodynamics of big small aircraft with similar power-to-weight ratio disclaimer majority of rc planes are ridiculously overpowered and the aerodynamics can be ignored altogether
i thought 96 strength was identical to 99 in whip stakes but how could the same be true for attack and defense ?
compared to strength where you get a max hit every few levels
it depends on how strongly tied you are to the idea of getting in somewhere this year how strong you are as an applicant and what schools/programs you are applying to .
if you are only applying to very competitive programs and only a mediocre applicant you may be shooting yourself in the foot .
i know people who applied to 15 schools and got no acceptances and i know successful phd holders who applied to as few as one school .
i 'm sure each of them would give you very different answers to this question .
absolutely but i could n't put that out there into the universe .

there are a couple of reasons why merchants want to charge over and above mrp .
firstly margins on cold drinks and water bottles is wafer thin .
as pepsi/coke enjoy monopoly in the market they command prices .
combine this with service costs we incur waiter salaries manager salaries commercial electricity on refrigeration/ac lost opportunity costs etc.. it is a loss making item .
restaurants carry it only because people ask for it .
so for someone running an establishment read cash sink it is much more profitable to sell self-produced drinks like lime soda buttermilk etc..
have you ever had a coke at haldiram 's ?
secondly and this is a bigger issue is the peculiar customer base in india .
quite a large percentage of people in india visit a restaurant to kill time .
and while it is okay in the lean hours people actually take a coke and sit through dinner .
one way to get those seats is over charging on beverages snacks .
it is not a filthy practice driven by greed .
the nasal spray is absorbed in the mucus gland inside your nose .
it 's actually a really effective way to get t into your system in a non irritant way unless your nose is super sensitive like mine .
check out the whitepaper gon na be the fastest blockchain to exist
the fact that you need to be a a about it is mind boggling .
i also see a lot of game of thrones merchandise as well which is another show aimed specifically at adults and related more to the show than the novels
i think even westworld has some merchandise not sure though
i have a folder full of guys having sex with their cars .
it 's also like when you see someone experience something and get upset you think it 's not even a big deal you 'll be fine '' and legitimately feel that way .
yet you feel every little thing that happens to you is a huge deal .
balefire counts towards the challenge can just poison the barrels and explode it right after .

this question should have gone in the daily question megathread .
the subreddit usually has good feedback for cssbuy but they 're not that good as agents imo .
i ordered shoes from them in like february and legit it took weeks before they even shipped to the warehouse .
they told me it was shipping for weeks until after messaging live chat they told me finally they were out of my size .
they said i could either choose a size 10 or a size 8.5 when i wanted a size 9 at the time .
overall bad first time experience superbuy and using lin for shoes was much easier cheaper and better .
it 'll be on ps4 as soon as it has a version available for official release '' .
you are correct in it not being the same at all .
fortnite feels like the arcade version of a battle royale game .
do n't use hog as ur chip source use him to punish bad elixir management .

if you 're the type of person that smashes expensive electronics i do n't think you have much dignity .
if you 're going to treat your kids like shit you deserve to be treated like shit when you 're old .
everyone will reach the point where they ca n't get out of bed without help one day .

blue are majors with ports dark blue are 2 slots minor where one of the slots is a port .
realised by last reply talked about minors instead of majors so i 've edited it for clarity .
for real though panzer what 's with the cancerous overlay on your streams in the past couple days ?
i appreciate they look pretty and maybe quite some effort went into them but they do make the stream harder to watch .

seriously they 're going to figure out one lot where they can build a 40 unit village .
ok how are you going to scale that to the 5000 units needed to house everyone ?
saw blade runner there last night and i agree .
there are people out there who have hundreds of hours of ftl behind them and still ca n't beat easy mode .
i had to use easy mode with the mod to stop the rebels advancing .
still lost to the quite a few of times especially to the flagship .
now i can beat it vanilla on easy half the time done it once on normal .
no if any woman would become the goddess of thunder it should be storm .

so is that an i.a.c repro or do you hate your wallet as much as i will one day
it 's suddenly shot up in price and luckily i purchased some when it was cheap as it looks good and there is no an insane amount of it available unlike some coins .
i do n't see a significantly long bear market coming anytime soon crypto is becoming something that 's useful something that is part of civilization 's infrastructure instead of just internet fun money .
cryptocurrencies will be based on real supply and demand and usage instead of merely speculation .
plus we have all of these decentralized exchanges coming out where you can trade anything for anything that will help decouple the price of altcoins to bitcoin .
it made a whole lot of sense in 1776 when states were worried new york and philadelphia would decide everything .
but when a vote in ca is worth 50 50 votes in ca is worth 1 in north dakota or whatever correct stats are comparable and easily googled it makes less sense .
but if ajit pai claims it we better double check the data .

none of my languages were built from scratch whatsoever .
i develop languages based on what sounds nice and/or what i think is cool .
i do n't even care too much if it 's just a relex .
while all my conlangs are created for peoples within my world building projects they mostly exist because i enjoy translating things .
for my more developed languages i have websites with entire pages filled with translations .

look back at the scene where he was shot it is definitely the jaw not the actual skull .
i think a civilian is anybody who goes home every night after their job is done .
because even if you are a cop you eventually take off the uniform put on some jeans or sweatpants and a tshirt and get into your normal '' car .
you are now a civilian once you do that in my books
the 9.7 is going to my grandparents this holiday but the 10.5 is so awesome .
mines is the opposite the first one trying to trigger the extraction usually have needs more to crack theirs ... .
one guy nicknamed moon-moon after the meme since also he got moon in his ign just steam rolled the objective and immediately head to extraction without knowing that he needs 2 more to crack the relic .
lucky for him i noticed it and two others aswell and stayed clear of the extraction zone .
after 2-3mins of calling him moon-moon and telling him of his reactant count in chat he finally notices it .
if it were n't for us he would have miss on his aklex link .
but that 's easy to check for statically and just by casually looking over the tests .
it seems strange to me how some low income americans are so militantly opposed to public healthcare .
there 's nothing edgier than this ridiculous my superstitions are correct and nobody is allowed to say anything otherwise '' attitude .
yeah same then i realised got items that were supposedly shipped to me but did n't come when i collected it yesterday .
is there anyone you can reach out to for help ?
serving your country to help the fight against an enemy of your country makes you traitor to who exactly ?

sorry to my fellow commuters for smelling like a pub this morning .
got ta go back to pretending that i 'm actually working .
and either write a non personal attacking reply on why you are having a different viewpoint .
i made a reply in this thread and it instantly got down voted just because it 's of a different opinion than theirs .
while i just say that i have the feeling the majority is self diagnosed .
that doesnt mean everyone has to share the opinion or that its true .
but then people on this sub send me threatening pms and tell me to kill myself as reply on my posting.. does n't really give the best light
what if i do n't do a bad or good deed ?

so i bought some bitcoin and litecoin on coinbase a few days ago .
for reference this was when litecoin was at 180 or so i put 45 usd into bitcoin and 20 into litecoin .
i 'm still in processing to get the coin portions so i 'm now curious does that mean i have made money already or have i been screwed by wait times ?
like literally as i was writing above i thought that if i bought the litecoin and got .12 of it i have that amount of coin and thus have made money .

good suggestion i hate that you cant change that on pc it is not a problem because you can just rebind the key but on console it is hell
i apologize i had just woken up and was in a bad mood and i 'm stressed for an interview this afternoon .
ah ok see our club name is kalista and the tag is rénd so the owner or whatever you call it gets bombarded with requests all the time .
winning another game is starting become a fear of mine 😬
i had that farfetch 'd named dux or something you can get from trading with that npc the only pokémon in the game at the time that could learn both fly and cut and i always carried that and a lapras who knew surf and strength cause i hated switching out pokémon just to move around the map .
pressed cut on accident instead of fly and was surprised you can cut grass .
another weird one i found was that snorlax can learn surf .
edit you can also fish inside buildings with water like the second gym .
i hardly see it as that when you 're with pyra for the whole game it 's kinda like oh yeah she looks like that '' but it does n't really make the story being told any worse .
makes me want to create a new account to troll on the main subreddit .
just agree and amplify all the sc propaganda beyond the point where even the most fanatical backer would start to question it .
true but only if there are any cell walls left to break down .
since they 're talking about cookies made of flour all the cell walls have already been destroyed .
in terms of similar feeling ones i was looking at some jonsbo/cooltek ones a while back their umx line for instance

this comment section needs a friendly reminder that gun control does not prohibit sane people from aquiring an apporpriately priced weapon for self-defense and sports gun control seeks to cut off criminals and instable people from accessing a mass-shooting-device .
you 're not affraid to get a drivers license as proof you can handle a car and you should not be offended by having to proof you can handle a gun either .
we are a digital signage store so stealing tags does n't exist .
i think they will have to do it manually .
i was flicking between visor up and down on the motorway for visibility and copped a fair bit of mucky spray off lorries ...
it 's not egoistical but i appreciate that you do not want to deal in absolutes .
people think that just because they grace the company with their presence by playing their game that they are somehow owed something when they ca n't .
the truth is server downtime is a regular thing in online games and sometimes things do n't go as planned .
if you want a quality game you have to allow them a quality amount of time .
i think it is just matlab being slow with that many cycles ...
freiza was afraid cause he did n't know he was gon na survive cause he had never been in that seat before low on energy on a exploding planet however he survived just fine
ik heb altijd wat gemengde gevoelens bij de sp .
aan de ene kant ben ik in hart en nieren een socialist altijd al geweest .
maar aan de andere kant spreekt de sp mij totaal niet aan .
als ik altijd naar sp campagne spotjes of posters kijk vind ik persoonlijk dat het niveau van de partij te laag ligt .
als ik dan altijd een horde mensen een beetje actie !
hoor schreeuwen met een hele boel sp vlaggen en ballonnetjes wordt dat beeld altijd alleen maar erger .
ik geef de schuld niet aan roemer zelf maar ik hoop wel dat er met zijn vertrek wat meer niveau de partij in sijpelt .
ben momenteel maar gewoon gl gaan stemmen terwijl ik mij daar ook niet thuis voel maar daar zit in ieder geval nog wat niveau .
i drink more than a gallon of water a day and my diet is heavy on some of the hottest hot sauces available i use the last 4 sauces on hot ones daily i do n't get sick often since making that my normal routine .
when i do feel something coming on i 'll break out some whiskey warm it up on the stove top stirring in some honey and some cloves then i strain it out and drink it .
i started reading them in english this year and it 's amazing i had only read them in spanish up until now .
we have to do things we do n't want to do all the time !
we are forced to put in clothing before we leave the house we have to obey traffic laws to get to work .
when you are at work you are not allowed to discriminate .
you ca n't put up a sign that says no blacks allowed .
it does n't matter if you do n't want to allow black people .
if you make cakes as a baker you can not say you wo n't make a cake for gay people or black people .
it does n't matter if you do n't approve of gay marriage .
you do n't have to perform in a ceremony .
you probably do n't have to write on the cake .
you are just making a cake and the decisions involved only involve cake .
if you do n't approve of interracial marriage you can not deny service to interracial couples .
unlike with gay marriage the majority of the us did not approve of interracial marriage until many years after it was permitted by federal law .
vendors were forced to make cakes for interracial marriages .
you can not justify denying equality for other people becuase of your beliefs about who they are allowed to marry .
if you made it to adulthood you actually stood a decent chance of living into your 60s or even beyond .
it was high infant mortality rates that dragged the average life expectancy down .
life expectancy of adults was about the same as now .
humans are simply most fertile around the ages of 16-30 .
the biological reproductive imperative would then make women within this age category most attractive to men and with modern culture 's emphasis on youthfulness the younger end of the spectrum is even more sought after .
this does n't excuse the behaviour of men and women who pursue adolescents .
just because they 're physically mature does n't mean they 're mentally mature .
that may not have mattered in hunter-gatherer tribes or the middle ages but now we understand the significance of mental and emotional readiness when it comes to sex and relationships and the impact engaging in them before one is ready can have on developing minds .
they forced abc to renew the show for an another season .
seems like it 's 10 of the normal payout so the third should be 120k .
i reckon the biggest deciding factor for episode order is tone .
they want to alternate between genre/feel to keep the audience on their toes and as much as possible give some respite with a more light-hearted episode after a dark one waldo moment after white bear sj after suad/playtest etc .
it 's also pretty important to lead into a season with something not too soul-destroying for the benefit of new viewers think nosedive .
i would have thought it would be something more black mirror-y than uss callister though .
from the trailers this seems the biggest departure from bm yet ...
guess we ca n't be sure of anything at this stage though .
their automated system has been known to block because ingame music .
i 'm just relaying it 's not a new issue for the community .
i cant talk about comparison but since having refinement on 2099 and him in tl lead i can easily ace most fights in vibranium even on auto .
oh and can do up to stage 3 of prox with him even without damage proc ... .where my wolv cant stay alive my 2099 can make it to the end .
i have stage 6 poah currently with no amp 'd uru so i have a ton of room for improvement too
the keeper almost looks like he thinks it 's going wide so not making much of an effort .
the thing is rehdiing idols is always a thing .
i do agree that it seemed like an unspoken rule that non-exile island seasons do n't have idols rehidden after the f7 but mvgx opened that pandora 's box when adam found an idol at f5 which was the last time it could be used .
while i do agree this episode did turn me off a bit on idol playing having another idol this time after the precedent they give in mvgx the last full season these castaways watched makes it fair game .
and really the rest should 've done more in trying to stop ben finding an idol than hope he would n't look at how hard tyson and co. did that in bvw to stop tina from getting it even though tyson already had one .
well that 's not what they say in the article that i provided .
edit province i 'm not a native speaker sorry for the mistake
like yes i 'm paid to pick up your shit but it makes my job much more difficult than it needs to be .
i agree.a blvl 4 is like a first encounter with the game and defenlity is worth to try it .
see i made a mistake in the last sentence .
did not mean tot say much later '' but not much later '' .
so if it said that shipping will start in january you can expect it to ship then .
you mean most maps on the chronicles arent that great ?
im also thinking about just buying the bo3 alone only costs 15 for ps4 on my country
you get what you pay for i give 3 stars lol
they all wear leather jackets have bikes apparently motorbikes are very cheap these days and have a serpents patch on the back of the jacket like mcs do .
yet they also allow seemingly anybody to join whether you 're a 40 year old man or a 15 year old girl .
you also need to recite a code of laws which gives off fraternity house vibes .
my girlfriend and i go to the movies go out to eat come home fall asleep in a food coma and have the obligatory every few weeks bang .
i re-installed the app and imported the wallet using the key .
the address is also not present in the list ?
catching up w a friend tmr and wondering if there 's any nice food recommendations ?

it makes me angry because she is n't like this with her other grandkids .
she has 7 kids and 5 of them have kids totaling 12 kids .
it 's because my son is her golden child 's kid .
i 've been to my son 's cousin 's concerts that she did n't even bother showing up to yet she calls my kid 's school to get the time and just shows up like some crazy stalker bitch .
even my son has said that he wishes she 'd hang out with her other grandkids and leave him alone .
after the 2016 elections i thought these people simply did n't exist .
as a person who 'd renounced his republicanism when trump became the nominee i thought the party had uniformly betrayed me and went back on everything .
the party is largely bad but there are non evil members .
make no mistake these people collins murkowski mccain corker etc ... are republicans and will therefore vote alongside their party a majority of the time but at least they have limits and lines .
trump seems to have zero limits and moore blurs every moral line that exists in the gop .
its a little freaky but if you ever experience it just concentrate on moving one small muscle .
it will take a bit but after you can move something small you start to pull out of it
i have them at sa20 with 4 dupes unlocked just no orbs invested .

publicly shaming an awkward nerd for annoying you is the social equivalent of shooting a homeless person in the face for begging for money while being smelly .
i think socially shaming someone is a much greater assault than slapping an ass .
slap him back in the face or go to the cops but grow up regardless .
it is still possible to find work over 60k per year and only have a high school diploma to your name which obviously is not recommended though not every student has such a clear vision/path for what they want to do with their lives .
i started later in life at 25 now 31 after years of odd jobs smartest thing i did was to get a forklift license and focus on production and warehousing work .

averaging 8hrs a week overtime i 'm bring in close to 85000 a year as a machine operator in a food production facility .
automation does threaten the industry but hey not everyone can be a software engineer .

did you know you can download his greek grammar for colleges as a pdf from textkit ?
i think doing an investigation may be a little overboard .
i agree you should have the direct manager talk to the employee to find out what their concerns are .
i like the approach of making it generic holiday themed event so all faiths and religions could be represented .
i think that 's a fair concession the manager can give to the employee .
but i would also get a commitment from the employee that they 'll be respectful of others choices of expression in the same way you 'd ask all employees to be respectful of theirs .
then if it continues it becomes a performance conversation the manager needs to have with the employee .
this just shows how the food industry treats their employees .
oh that high-end restaurant you just paid 60 a plate for ?

i guess the only problem for fourfold pillar for auto battle is the fact that you will fill up both your unit and item inventory real quick which requires constant supervision .
he 's decent in the post but he is n't huge and can get bullied by the best centers in the league imo .
but he knows where to be and what his role is even if he gets smoked .
i ca n't believe i did n't know about this .
i just hope this does n't start popping up on every website 's top cs go launch options '' page or inevitably these server companies will probably look for a work around .
well i suppose the rest of the world could do it too if they had rattlesnakes .
i watched part of an episode of how to get away with murder with my lady friend and i had to check out after a half a dozen steamy sex scenes .
the show did n't seem to have any plot just moved from one couple to another getting it on in various ways and places .
i am sure not all the episodes are like that but i did not stick around .
i used to use mechanix until i picked up a pair of or ironsights .
some of my squadmates use fdts and while they 're tempting as they 're so dextrous or 's warranty policy is just too good you can use and abuse those gloves until they fall apart and or will exchange them with new ones for free .
man do n't care is from that album is probably his biggest song .
it 's also the birth of gigg 's infamous batman line .
hard to put my finger on if he looks bloated or if it 's just the angle .
but he looks particularly unattractive in this pic and the monotone colors do n't help either .
but in europe leaving money on the table is such a strange thing to do
i 've owned a tesla since early 2014 and i have not watched that particular broadcast yet .
i 'll get around to it eventually but that plate literally says anus tart not a new start .
i do n't think either way is better they 're just simply different .
i️ prefer a healthy mix of easy to normal to hard without it necessarily being in that order .
i 'd love a few dungeons like there used to be but i️ also enjoy the new style like i️ said i️ enjoy them differently .
let 's have both if we can though this series should always remember it 's roots just like the fans do .
yeah personally i was n't a big fan of rogue one but these builds are too good to pass up on especially since they are in the original trilogy .
i 'm probably also going to pick up the at-st for christmas .
what do the colors on it symbolize just to ask ?
i 'm thinking la lakers but i might be wrong
so horrifying to live in a world like that .
you go outside to go inside to go outside to go inside to go ... . fuck
i 've only been to 1 game in 2003 but i was a little kid then i do n't even think about that
because they 're every bit the propaganda house that fox is the only difference is their party is n't in charge anymore .
were you okay with the last 8 years of cnn state media but suddenly object once power changes hands ?
everything tanks like a mofo at op8 but florentine is still really strong
yeah i feel like it 's an emotional affair .
i feel like a relationship can grow stronger from here however it can also just get worse and ruined .
he said that he have tried to talk with me about things but i 'm hard to talk with about personal issues and that i 'm sometimes very distant and cold not responding not trying not wanting etc ...
i know i sound so stupid and idiot wanting to forgive this man but man i do n't know what to freakin do .
it 's just chaos in my head i have no friend and no one to talk to this about .
and it hurts so much that he 's not that genuine nice caring and amazing person i thought he was .
picture yourself the most nicest person you know of just turning into someone else..
he even ditched a good friend of his because that guy cheated on his girlfriend physically .
he said he does n't want to be friends with someone who is such an asshole and he has been so against cheating and all.. wow .
not sure if there is any data saying that it 100 is .
it was just a comfortable spec i remember from back in the day .
i run players7 meph and just use the moat trick to cheese it .
the dps is good enough for me but i do not do any tanking .
those are some of the new basic ones cig is going to give us both basic controls as default settings and advanced controls as an option in a future patch .
just a friendly fyi your website looks awful on mobile .
was n't it stated the full outfit would require 5,000 of the clue currency ?
i 'm expecting the clues to give 1/2/3/4/5 of that currency depending on the tier so anywhere from 5k easy clues to 1k masters or anywhere in between .
i could keep throwing questions at you but you 'll keep spinning them to fit your world view .
we 're never going to change each others minds .
i 'll just ask a final question if a person witnesses a murder 20 years prior then finally comes forward with time place and description of the murder should any investigation be done ?
or should it just be a shrug and say it was too long ago and the accuser probably has motivations for lying so lets just ignore it ?
or if the writers had any conception of how ranks work .
they did n't promote him partly because 'there was n't enough room for another lieutenant ' on voyager even after they demoted paris .
the other was that apparently one of the showrunners hated him and almost had him removed from the show .
i remember always feeling so bad for them how hot they must have been .
i loved the press conference they done for one event although they never done it after .
or certain people do n't care what fear mongering echo chambered shills think .
we both know you and most everyone on this shithole site did n't even read the countering proposal do n't even understand title ii and clearly do n't understand that neither soros google amazon and the other big corporations pushing for nn do n't give a flying fuck about you and their reasons are for their interests not yours .
you should buy some high yield bonds trading at a discount that mature in 2-5 years .

i 've talked to my parents about getting a teacher but it 's too expensive for them .
trickle down is just the marketing term used to appease their donors .
she claimed that the break was n't too bad and that the british hospital gave her the brace .
i ca n't find a yutoob clip of her entrance which is when she says it .
but she is a professional liar so we ca n't take her word for it .
and my point is one could have a worse break without it being compound .
critics are calling it the thrill ride of the year !
many of the dz landmarks in 07-09 have waves which means double bosses .
so sometimes i get 300 ge creds per landmark instead of 150 .
well that clip was from the ghost busters episode and the ghost busters 2 game was better so maybe this is some sort of calling .
maybe itsuno needs someone to fully see his first shot at dmc .
and it 's not gon na be me so good luck my man !
you 'll be fine i 'm honestly surprised you are n't trying to combine the 2 for a speedball like effect .
well we finally got one back from the stanley cup
the title should say my best goodwill ... '' ... sorry about that-was n't trying to sound too full of myself there .
i 've had a string of bad relationships so i started to feel that it was me causing the issues .
but i 'm always upfront and honest and try to communicate and i think i just pick all the guys with baggage and communication issues who do n't want to express feelings .
i think i may just have to keep reading through this reply whenever i start to doubt myself .
shit i 'll hire you right now if you really have the software engineering chops .
put in a couple years and my company will pay for your ms .
yea that was pretty baller and especially with these star wars nights .
we need a luc flair with a jedi robe on .
theres a large indian community in america so you will have a big potential audience for your videos .
the medical examiner concluded that garner was killed by compression of neck choke hold compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police '' .
no damage to garner 's windpipe or neck bones was found .
and the nt only makes sense within the context of the ot and its prophesies .
jesus himself refers to ot scripture so if the ot god '' is false this puts him into question aswell .
yeah the sum of my knowledge on how to read and write is basically just remembering what sound each letter is and then piecing them together .
you are right the actual range of punishment is available .
as preds fans found out last year ... if his skate is n't on the ice he 's offsides .
if the preds get this one it 's technically correct but it 's not at all in the spirit of the game .
ugh yeah when they 're waiting in the rain i hate how he interrupts her !
i like your comments on how his ramblings basically say i do n't care if you win '' anymore helped me make sense of that scene more .
does garmin use a different os for va3 than fenix 5 ?
or are the issues you identified more related to hw build ?
i played league for 2 years without ever feeling the need to spend any money at all .
i do n't think many people intend to play the majority of the champions on a regular basis .
a dozen or so champs are free to try out every week and then you can just buy the ones you especially like .
i 've always been able to afford another by the time i was tired of the last few i 'd bought .
i hope to see more restorations in the future .
that as well as facial reconstructions of exhumed kings and chieftains .
just saw the open three kemba missed near the end if the half and it was irritating .
just tired of seeing makeable shots wasted and the experts blaming howard for any offensive woes .
just received mined and double checked my account and they did honor the price !
what would be your cases or advantages/disadvantages between choosing the schiit modi 2 uber jds labs ol dac or topping d30 ?
should i connect my powered speakers to my dac too ?
i remember reading somewhere that i could use a 3.5mm what my speakers use to rca and plug it to the rca output in the back if i were to use speakers only .
i assume i 'd have to use a switch would that cut down quality ?
to make this work if i want to use headphones speakers ?
since the headphones are going through an amp that is connected via rca to the dac .
anytime she gets a new book she reads the last page first but i think she just does it because she does n't like suspense .
she also records tv shows but reads about what happens on the internet before she watches it .
people have made changes to battlefront 2 with their outcry but for some people its never enough .
go burn ea to the ground and force companies to go bankrupt throwing money to devs who will eventually start charging more money because people want better and better games that will never meet their high standards .
i unlike most people here am in college and intend to have a life outside of my family and basement .
i do n't have time to go on lovely little crusades against companies with enough money to likely shut down their dissidents if they could .
i enjoy the game for its gameplay and stylistic attributes that the devs put into the game .
i bought the game after ea made their change so i am taking an active part in confirming that the changes they made were the right ones .
a reader recently emailed a question regarding a brokerage wrap account he had inherited from a relative .
he mentioned that he was being charged a one percent management or wrap fee and also suspected that he was incurring a front-end load on the a share mutual funds used in the account .
upon further review we determined that the mutual funds were not charging him a front-end load .
almost all of the funds being used however had expense ratios in excess of one percent plus most assessed 12b-1 fees paid to the brokerage firm as part of their expense ratios .
are brokerage wrap accounts a good idea for you ?
let 's take a look at some questions you should be asking .
i highly recommend clicking through to the whole piece .
i 'm no longer religious myself but this article reminds me of the period of my life now long passed when i was convinced that christianity was a force for good in the world .
i do n't agree with the author 's politics but i 'd have a drink with him any day and talk about it .
she did a sketch for me of all the little things we did in the 3 weeks that she was over here and gave it me the the last day she was here .

i have been trying to learn hag but every map is that or lery 's
you see her interviews and she´s always laughing and her eyebrows dancing .

go into settings in circle and change your currency to usd .
this will sell your bitcoin balance for cash and then you can withdraw it to a bank or debit card .
note that you ca n't change your currency back to btc on circle after you do this it 's a one way street .
the coinbase price when you sell is lower than their quoted price and probably about the same as what you 'll get in circle .
lgd vs optic should be an easy win for lgd
they 're a lot more interesting then the protagonist .

i know the b is silent but if i do n't pronounce it people might not be fully aware of how to spell it .
it 's my sacrafice for the good of humanity .
not sure what happened but i signed up for the secret santa the day after it closed never got notification or any correspondence and thought i missed it .
i got a gift from someone a bit over a week ago .
so i searched my email spam folder logged into elfster which for some reason did not have an account for me and found nothing .
since then i 've pm'ed king_icewind here and sent him email as well with no response .
not sure what the mix up is but i never received any notification of a match or replies to my requests .
i know we are past the send date but if i can find out who my match is and some idea of what they had on their wishlist i still should be able to get a gift sent to them .
in one of the item descriptions in coo it names all the members of the old vanguard .
i think the hunter mentioned could be who we see on the cover of dlc 2 .
set it aside for gaming and things you 'd rather do .
play the shit out of those games and lazy crap until you get bored .
then get hype for when you are allowed to come back .
have fun with your programming skills and try to knock out a future problem .
ie making a gps videogame would teach you gps skills and be more fun than implementing gps in your app .
when your video game is done it should be pretty easy to incoporate gps .
now that disney has the movie rights for magneto i 'm sure they 'll change their idiotic retcon back to normal .
they need to compensate us with this ark class .
i 'm watching videos on it now because of the maintenance
this sounds like a sketch straight out of the office
there have been other china companies with goo in their names before this .

have you seriously not heard about all the people in the entertainment business that been getting called out ?
or is that too inconvenient for your shit argument ?
if it 's something that you do n't want people to know about until after you 're dead write it down and put it in a place where your loved ones will find it .
it sure would be nice to know about my family 's old country story i 'm super curious and the little bits that we 've heard over the years make it sound like an interesting story .
alas it 's not to be because everyone with knowledge of the old country has passed .
i do n't know if adam devine is douchey enough to ask teenagers questions about how they masterbate .
but some mormon bishops are and that 's a concern .
even for new or inexperienced artists 1-5 is a low offer .
which means that this is far from doing new artists a favor .
the only person who wins with this is the person getting a whole lot of art for barely any money .
honestly if you want to do them a favor ?
pay them fairly and let them know that their art is worth something .
we already have over a foot of snow here .
i ca n't wait to move to a place where they actually plow the roads too !
i have a 60 mile round-trip commute just to use the gym everyday in hayward and the roads are trash .
convenience of the y is probably great for you .
but i get the whole one squat rack '' thing .
my current gym has only one and it is also the only bench .
let me know if you ever check out princeton .
they do have express locations all over town too .
plus a pool and free classes if you 're into that .
i 'm looking forward to swimming on my rest days .
ok coin pushers like those have been regulated here as gambling but not everywhere .
ones which give ability to win money are more often termed gambling but there are still exceptions where it 's treated as a game of skill because some places treat the payment as an entry to play the game depends on where you live .
ones which give tokens which let you play other games are usually not termed gambling .
if the prizes have super low in some areas it 's like 4 to no monetary value they usually do n't get termed as gambling either which allows arcades to function with them in .
but even these machines if rewards are not consistent enough then investigations happen and machines get shut down .
if investigators find that machines have zero skill involved and all chance they will more likely shut them down .
atheism is in the broadest sense the absence of belief in the existence of all deities .

once again the nordic countries showing the world how it should be done
i was n't saying that it did n't look good and was n't impressive .
i actually really liked the one girl in white with the face lines but that the academy probably decided that they preferred how ss make-up looked .
grand budapest hotel also won best make-up and it was very subtle .
i 'm just saying that there are many things to take into consideration and they probably decided for different reasons than you did .
as i understand it they do have fish and wildlife officers go around the popular fishing spots and if they ask to see your license you have to produce it on the spot .
if they were to ask him for his and try to verify the information it would be an issue .
but they only do that if they have reason to believe you do n't have your license or your causing issues .
i thought some states issue non-driver license ids assuming you do n't drive for just this purpose of identification ?
yes my events are all to sell which bewear are you interested in ?
i 'm liking them but the perks were pretty tame and did n't seem like they were going to fix any underpowered weapons .
if they included old perks like army of one icarus etc ... it could have made some guns viable but even then we 'd probably still use the same guns if there was no weapon balancing that changes meta .
they 'd really have to replace or buff certain perks in order to make the majority of guns appealing .
some you buy because they 're on ‘sale ' .
some you plan to play some day but never find the time .
i hope this enough justice for his victim s because unfortunately they are n't getting anything else .
i do n't care if that makes me a bad person .

hi i 'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image
this is also the anniversary of the announcement of smoke mirrors
he obviously ca n't work so that question is stuck out in left field somewhere .
the more you look at it it seems very likely that they just set a death sentence for the guy and he wo n't last very long .
i 'm getting it as a part of a trade later today
i had bed bugs over 2 years ago and the only explanation was the bus .
my husband works hvac and works in houses being constructed in the cold .
at the time and i still do i was busing twice a day to and from work .
i suspected bed bugs when i would wake up with itchy fingers and forearms .
tried to delude myself that maybe it was spider bites .
when i looked it up online i checked my mattress after .
our mattress is thick and sits on wood slats rather than a box spring .
when i lifted it i saw about 6 adults .
went into panic mode and after hardcore scrubbing laundry and 2 treatments they were gone .
they 're stubborn little fuckers and i 'm positive i got them from the bus .
they are small and a dark rust colour so hard to spot on darker clothes .
a lot of people do n't know what to look for so they do n't realize they even have them .
unfortunately you ca n't avoid people on the bus so i always try to check my clothes when i get home .
contrary to popular belief untidy/dirty people are n't the only ones who get them .
i 'm pretty anal about the cleanliness of my home .
they do love clutter though as clutter gives them more places to hide .
and ottawa is having a lot of issues with bed bugs .
best thing to do if you 're worried is google what they look like and check your bed .
check in the folded seams on the top and bottom of your mattress under it and your box spring .
they basically cement their eggs on surfaces and it takes some hard scrubbing to get them off .
why would he think that this video would do him any more good than harm ?
is trading cp3 for kawhi worth it in a league with dds ?
funny how you ignore google apple and amazon who are the biggest violators of nn ...

i quit sold my collection and still played regularly for a full year afterwards while owning no cards myself .

being able to give borrow and trade makes an enormous difference in accessibility to the game .

idk the lyrics just made me cry when i was driving because i 'm in college and there 's a strong possibility i will be looking back on these days in the future as the good old days '' .
so i should n't be too worried or scared or whatever and just live it up as much as i can right now
calvin harris is one of those musicians that just stay good and relevant all the while getting better unlike avicii

from another this is the happiest day of my life that i want to remember forever and that i 've been dreaming and saving up for my entire life it 's worth it
that 's because of that point exactly that they charge us 8k .
they use that feeling to convince us to buy it at a high price .

agreed but i do n't think russ played that bad to be honest .

he said europeans may trust their government more than those in the us because they are less religious .
most of the family members advising us to get a credit card are either in a large amount of credit debt purposefully keep a balance on their card correct me if i 'm wrong but is n't this just throwing away money to interest ?

my parents decided to enroll me in swimming lessons when i was about 2.5 years old .
i ca n't completely remember the details but all i know is i pannicked was going under and my mum who was heavily pregnant could n't get me out of the water .

iv had this too confirmed the transaction sent to my email .
and nothing in the online wallet people on cryptopia forums are saying they had to wait like 4 hours or so fot it to come in to their online wallet .
i did this about 10hours ago and still nothing .
the wallet address is correct and the transaction is showing as complete in cryptopia .
so i guess it 's a matter of time and the issues with the site should hopefully iron out
all the up and coming successful actors i know either run their own business or serve .
you definitely have to be willing to struggle and make sacrifices and if you ever make a living as an actor it most likely will take more than a couple years to get there .
i 've been out of theatre school for 8 years 3 years in a major market and only about 20-30 of my income comes from acting .
the kkk started as that periods version of alt-right trolling .
https psmag.com/social-justice/the-ku-klux-klan-were-memelords that 's why they have stupid names like grand goblin and imperial wizard and why they needed masks .
the goofiness and so-called irony with which the alt-right goes about fascism can seem distinctly postmodern and internet-forged but a similar humor animated the reconstruction klan .
all the klannish affectations and accoutrements that seem so ridiculous today—the alliterative k 's the costumes the magic the gathering titles like grand wizard '' and exalted cyclops '' —were ridiculous and self-consciously so .
one of the functions of humor for the klan parsons says was to mark their transgressions as acceptable .
the right believes in the truth of racial and gender inequality and the legitimacy of domination as the engine of change '' she says but in america after the civil war stating that openly becomes more taboo .
so they used humor to shake loose people 's refusal to talk about inequality playfully illustrating what they thought should be reality .
they creatively destabilized norms to shake people loose of comfortable pieties . ''
like the klan the proud boys actually do think that patriotic militias of white men should be the foundation of american political society and as long as they perform it as a circus show they can avoid some of the consequences for acting out that fantasy .
much of the klan 's early reputation may have been based on almost frivolous mischief and tomfoolery .
at first a favorite klan tactic had been for a white-sheeted klansman wearing a ghoulish mask to ride up to a black family 's home at night and demand water .
when the well bucket was offered the klansman would gulp it down and demand more having actually poured the water through a rubber tube that flowed into a leather bottle concealed beneath his robe .
after draining several buckets the rider would exclaim that he had not had a drink since he died on the battlefield at shiloh .
he then galloped into the night leaving the impression that ghosts of confederate dead were riding the countryside .
the presence of armed white men roving the countryside at night reminded many blacks of the pre-war slave patrols .
the fact that klansmen rode with their faces covered intensified blacks ' suspicion and fear .
whippings were used first but within months there were bloody clashes between klansmen and blacks northerners who had come south or southern unionists .
from the start however there was also a sinister side to the klan .

however i 've literally never heard him bring it up .
i feel like if people went through actual trauma in the war they 'd do their best to never ever talk about it again .
at least i think that 's what happened with my dad .

i honestly think many guys just use it as a form of sympathy or as a way to look tough and i 'd agree with others in this post that most of these guys have never even seen combat .

10 people will watch those shows and come away with 10 different opinions about it and the so called recurring content he 's claiming is being pushed .

what do you see as a better implementation of the energy mechanic if you do n't mind answering ?
i really hate the way that it currently is designed/implemented as it just feels like a punitive version of mana without any workarounds .
but at the same time i like the very self-contained resource with no way for the champ to buy their way out of the gating .
idk if it 's your thing or not but i loved what you did with gnar and would like to see more creative uses of the secondary resource bar especially with mana being as thematically dull as it is currently .

i get that cms were for a small part of the playerbase and there were a lot of issues with classes/specs at lower gear levels but you could still clear golds with any class as dps/tank/healer in the group .

there was rarely any public complaints about them on forums .
it was nice time waster '' if you will .
now my playtime is lowered drastically as there is one less major reason to log on outside of raids when they 're on farm .
progress raiding is fun but farm raiding is not .
cms were affected with each raid tier as well with new stat allocations on items and new trinkets to play with .
any boosting issues they had with rmting are prevalent in m at a greater scale with added incentives from buyers as there are power upgrades at play there .
one thing that 's really great for paul is he does n't have to worry about fouls at all .

we ran an a/b test at work on out website users and found a statistically significant difference in conversion rates from x to y in one of the treatments .
user attributes like gender work title location ... i was asked to slice and dice the results further to see for example if there 's a difference between males and females .
i think an obvious disadvantage or issue with doing that is that we might not have enough observations in each of the sub-populations to draw a valid conclusion .
a possible advantage is to get more insights on how our users were affected and maybe offer them different experiences .
are there any other disadvantages pitfalls things to watch out for ?
my supply seems to be dropping after only a few days after starting weight watchers .
my daughter is nearing 1 year old but i really would like to nurse until she is closer to 2 .
neither of us are ready to stop breast feeding so i hope this dip in supply is reversible .
i know i have gotten lazy with the pump i have been busy at work and started pumping once a day vs twice .
i also started dieting for my sister 's wedding in september .
with weight watchers it 's tricky baseline points for my age and height is 23 per day if i were exclusively nursing i would have 41 and supplementing is 28 .
i know i am eating enough because i eat all day long but it 's also a majority of low or 0 points foods veggies fruit chicken turkey etc .
i chose the supplementing range because she does eat some solids but she takes about 15-20 oz per day in bottles and nurses 3-5 times a day before/after work/bedtime/middle of the night sometimes .
i do n't know if i am looking for advice or just hope that i can return to a more normal supply by increasing my pump sessions i hate that thing or what i need to do .
babe seems satisfied when she is nursing but when i pump i am consistently 1-2 oz short of what she demands in her bottles which has never been an issue .

should i read them openly in front of my wife ?
or keep them hidden and read them in secret ?
on one hand i would n't want to undermine any beneficial effects the books might have by coming across as passive-aggressive by reading them openly .
on the other hand i would n't want her to find out about them and think i was trying to manipulate her .

will they be purge by inquisitor/grey knights on sight or will they back off from the legion of the damn ?
i just want to check my knowledge by using an example of two of the coins i 'm in which i wo n't name because i 'm not going to be accused of shilling around these here parts .
let 's say this first coin is roughly .25 and has a current market cap of 165 million .
we want the coin to rise in market cap to hopefully a few billion to be in the top 10 correct ?
so to do that the coin would have to multiply by roughly 24-25x to reach 4 billion-ish .
if it does that the coin value then raises to about 6 per coin and everyone is happy .
in that same vein if the second coin is priced cheaply let 's say .20 but the market cap is already 3.5 billion is that a sign that it may not gain all that much ?
or is it possible that the coin is good enough to blast straight past the 4 billion market cap and into much higher numbers ?
given that only the very tip top of the charts are in the 10 's of billions how likely would that be ?
if not please explain/feel free to send some literature my way i 'd rather be an educated investor than an uninformed one .
i 'm invested in coins with both of these examples so that 's why i 'm curious about this aspect and want to understand it better .

i 've been craving a proper competitive 5v5 experience from riot with meaningful stakes for a while now .
the most memorable moments i 've had playing league is in season 6 when me and my friends were 5 man dynamic queueing to get into plat for the first time .
since none of us ever had been platinum at the time winning the games had an extra level of importance added to it that caused us to take the matches very seriously .
drafting comps banning champs that counter our comp shotcalling objectives and rotations in-game etc .
but ever since season 6 ended i 've never got to experience that type of excitement through full 5 man team play again since dynamic got split into solo and flex .
technically flex is the same as 5 man dynamic but since nobody cares what their flex rank is so the stakes were n't there to make the games feel important .
custom 5v5s came close to that experience because our egos and pride were on the line but it 's still not the same since ranks between the 10 players ranged from never ranked and bronze to diamond 5 and plat .
i made a video https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=jxcrhr06icw talking more in-depth on why this mode is so important to me and how it will let people potentially have a lot more fun with league than they ever knew they could but
tl dr/tl dw clash is the best way to play league .

this is our first trip of more than a few hours and any help on making it smooth will be tremendously appreciated .
this is for 2016 and i use ufile and it put my income on 104 .
revenue canada sent me a letter now saying i have 2 weeks to answer their questions to make sure the income has been reported as required i definitely reported all my income and paid the right amount based off individual rates for my province .
i think they might want clarity because i/ufile put this income on line 104 because it is foreign income from the usa but maybe they instead expected me to file it in another way because in addition to the income being foreign i am also self employed .
the questions in the questionnaire start by asking if any of the income reported on line 104 is considered to be self-employed income which is why i suspect that perhaps i filed it the wrong way .
looking at it i am a bit confused now because i am a contractor that made foreign income so now i am not sure if line 104 was the right place to put this or not .
also if this is wrong and i should n't have put it as foreign income and instead as self employment income then looking at ufile if i adjust it it reports that i underpaid due to cpp .
i filed my income on line 104 for the past several years so that would mean i did n't pay cpp for several years and now i 'm quite scared if that 's the case that i am in trouble .
and apologies if anything i said does n't make sense .
i am in my early twenties and i 'm quite new to filing taxes .

i recently built myself a new pc 1600 x and b350-plus but i am experiencing some strange temperatures on the cpu .
i first noticed when psensor showed me temperatures as high as 100° c during video conversion on linux and the pc kept force shutting down .
after about 10 minutes i was presented temps around 76° c while the ryzen master tool for some reason showed 86° c just before the system shut down again .
i am using a coolermaster masterliquid lite 120 cooler and configured the 'turbo ' fan curve in the bios .
so far i have n't lost any data but i do n't want this to happen during gaming or when i am doing some critical work .
any ideas on where these temps could come from or what to do about them ?

a couple months ago i picked up one of these https www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx ? item=n82e16824236335 to replace my ten year old tn panel .
old monitor is now being used as a secondary .
the ips looks as beautiful as i 've read it would in so many places but i do notice something is off when it comes to fast motion .
i ca n't put my finger on it but something just looks wrong .
it has n't been too much of a distraction though however now i am in the market for another new monitor and am hoping to find something that 's a happy medium between the vibrance of an ips and responsiveness of a tn .
i was looking at an asus vg248qe https www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx ? item=n82e16824236313 cm_re=asus_144hz-_-24-236-313-_-product for a couple years but i 've always heard that the colors on it were a little muddled .
just recently i heard of the samsung cfg70 https www.amazon.com/gp/product/b01m1deeyp/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_1 ? ie=utf8 psc=1 smid=a1eg1pspal6zia .
this one really interests me as i 've heard that va panels are somewhat of a middleground between ips and tn in both responsiveness and color .
is it something i 'd be happy with considering i 'm looking for a best of both worlds approach ?
how would you compare it to an ips side by side ?
has anyone else experienced a girlfriend or wife that pays quite a bit of attention to your penis just casually not in a purely sexual i want to have sex kind of way ?
my exwife would want to hold it while we lounged in bed or noticeably check out my bulge at completely random times and talk to it like its a pet .
my current wife likes me to wear tight underwear and has named it the captain '' .
she will like to gently touch it in public and say hello there '' in a kind of almost not obiwan kenobi plutonic way and she too likes to hold it like you would hold hands with someone while watching a movie .
do they do it because they believe its an ego boost for their man ?

for every 3000 stamina the shield health is increased by 57 .
i noticed that if i have 8100 stamina on my shield the health is only 617k and if i have 6100 stamina the health on my shield is 850k .
mind you with 8100 stamina my electronics is shit .
does the shield still scale with electronics for the base health and the every 3000 stamina adds the 57 to the base ?
i got kind of lost when i added more stamina only to see the shield health drop over 200k .

tl dr call your isp and threaten to disconnect service if tiered plans come out .
i work tech support for one of the biggest isp 's in the country .
for the past week or so they 've been rolling out the company line on nn and how they support the lowered regulations and such .
in a meeting a supervisor pretty much confirmed what everybody knows comcast will be putting out a tiered package first then everyone else will be falling in line .
what most isp 's are doing right now is gathering metrics on what they think they can get away with without losing customers .
like i said once one goes they 'll likely all go eventually but if there 's an overwhelming negative reaction we can likely delay those packages coming into the market until the courts rule or hopefully even to 2020 .
as of yet i personally have received zero 0 calls on nn and my co-workers have similar numbers .
at this point we want to delay the isp 's while nn is being fought in the courts .
call your isp and tell them not to add a tiered service plan or you will disconnect service .
hell get management on the line give them what for .
the most important thing is to not harass anyone on the call .
polite yet firm insistence on not implementing a tiered service plan and to speak to a supervisor will get you fairly far in the company hierarchy .
i can only speak for my company but there are processes to escalate to the ceo and i 'd assume other companies are similar .
if you can get a director vp or even the big decision makers on the line and tell them that you and your friends and family will be disconnecting that may not change their minds on nn but just getting that far may give the isp 's pause in rolling out their plans .
tl dr call your isp and threaten to disconnect service if tiered plans come out .
1 will amd have a conference at ces 2018 ?
2 does anybody know when will amd announce the second gen of ryzen ?
if anybody says that they 'll have a special conference for that since ryzen got announced at a special conference i do n't think so .
amd announced ryzen on a special con that they made especially because they wanted to show off ryzen and make as much noise of their comeback as they can ... now its not even zen 2 that maybe will have a special con for it its just a refresh ... .smaller node and new sensemi technologies ...
i see a lot of posts about adding someone usually a minor child to a credit card to help their credit .
i 'm 33 have great credit and have never had a credit card .
i get that a lot of the boost is from length of time having the credit .
but not to sound crotchety i did fine without ever needing a credit card .
i 've been thinking about what people are saying you 'll have to pay for separate things like facebook or instagram etc . ''
if that was the case is n't that basically stealing business from those sites ?
something as simple as an ad in a game site would lose exposure theoretically making them lose money .
would this be grounds for these organizations to sue ?
i have two videos this time vid1 https spankbang.com/1qmd1/video/eno000000101+www+javnofilm+com and vid2 https spankbang.com/1qmcq/video/eno000000102+www+javnofilm+com .

hey folks does anyone know how to find streamers on twitch that play indie games ?
literally joined a game where the oc had a 65 ovr squad then he left .
we have removed it because of the following reason s yet again i 'm putting together a post to discuss this in one place so please stop spamming the board with this stuff .
for future reference please refer to the r/warthunder faq and rules .
if you have any questions please do not hesitate to pm the gulag team .
how else is is supposed to recreate the feeling of your favorite characters getting rng screwed with bad levelups ?
it 's a part of fire emblem we all know and love/hate .
so my clinic just informed me that i need to redo my amh test before we start our next cycle .
i have crazy long cycles but my lp is pretty consistently 11-12 days which puts my cd1 around the 22nd or 23rd not 100 sure which day i ovulated .
this means i 'll be out of town on cd2-3 .
and they have to do the amh test in house for it to count .
has anyone here managed to get blood drawn at a random lab and ship it back to their re ?
any suggestions for the type of lab i should be looking for or national chains that will do it would be great they said quest and labcorp wo n't ship anymore or this would be easy .
when i search about net neutrality a story about that indian dj ajit pai pops up and i clicked to his twitter and saw his personal website is ajitpai.com .
then click on that and it says bandwidth limit exceeded '' .
for a second i thought it 's a bit funny and ironic..even though i know it 's because too many people go to this site and the server probably is n't a big one and did n't expect so much traffic visiting it .
it is still a perfect match to the topic and to its coincidental url lol
hey guys i recently got the tangerine 2 cashback card and i am wondering if i should close my old td green visa card since i wo n't be using it anymore .
i heard that it might be better for your score if i just keep the card and stash it somewhere is that true ?
my score according to credit karma is like 770 so tbh i dont really mind a drop just wan na know which option makes more sense .
so i noticed my pc was getting slow and to the point to where i can not livestream or play a videogame .
yet i noticed my cpu i7 6800k was being maxed out while just idling on the desktop .
i have used malware bites and removed all that it would remove .
however after the scan and removal it will not let me turn real time protection on .
i click it it immediately switches back to off .
i click show file location on the most stressful windows program .
this is my pc of course and i look in the users of course im the only user .
then i find 2 other folders giving me the same thing .
i go to the advanced security settings for folder name '' imsohtu .
the owner field shows unable to display current owner . ''
when i click change '' i get you do not have permission to view or edit this object 's permission settings .
i 'm wondering i 'm starting the game again .
my first game i used all of them on lakeroad lvl 15 if i remember correctly but now i would like to keep them for highger race so can we accumulate more than one qualification certificate ?
i 'm davis and i 'm from canada i 'm currently 18 and looking for a partner to have dirty chats with from time to time .
currently i do n't have much of a interest towards rp but if i get to know you well we can try it out
i 'm into almost any kind of chat nothing really makes me uncomfortable aside from gore and stuff .
really all i 'm looking for is someone to chat with from time to time maybe once a week or everyday !
if you want to start talking just send me a dm !
il be watching them just send me a little about yourself .
hey so i built my pc a while back and ended up buying a digital version of windows 10 online no physical disc .
i want to do a fresh install and reformat my computer but i do n't want to have to buy windows 10 again is there any way to transfer my windows 10 account ?
i do n't know how to get my key if that 's what i need .
round 5 is in the books and here are the results .
taking next best with 10 points is chapter 16a ruled by madness '' .
taking next worst also with 10 points is chapter 12a village of silence '' .
back in september i started a fire emblem 7 map tier list after being inspired by an attempt at a fe6 map tier list the year before .
after a few weeks of voting the final results were tallied and we had our list https www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/70zj5f/rfireemblem_made_a_blazing_blade_map_tier_list .
shortly thereafter u/hbthebattle started a fire emblem 4 map tier list which resulted in the following list https www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/72924f/rfireemblem_made_an_fe4_map_tier_list .
now two months later i felt that it was time to start another map tier list .
as chosen by you the people fire emblem 8 the sacred stones will have it 's maps tier next .
now obviously maps are n't as easy to tier as units .
there is much more subjectivity in play and it 's harder to rule out bias .
the main things to keep in mind are difficulty fun and overall design .
you can respond if you have n't played hm but keep in mind things are changed on that mode which can affect opinions of certain maps
ephraim maps will be referred to as b and eirika 's as a. ex father and son is 14b 11a is creeping darkness etc
this is not an ltc playthrough just a moderately efficient playthrough .
i 'm not expecting everyone to clear the maps in 1-2 turns but we are n't taking any longer than we have to so no dilly dallying
in regards to the warp staff maps will not be penalized for being able to be warp skipped.however both the quality of the map as a warpskip and the quality of the map not being warpskipped will be considered if warp is available
maps from 15 onward will be considered from both maps ' perspective as the difference is n't large enough to separate them
the exceptions being chapter 15 scorched sand and chapter 16 ruled by madness ' which will both be split into 15a 15b 16a 16b
things like gaiden unlocks and character recruitments are considered when ranking a map
please elaborate on your choices as it is a subjective matter and knowing why you like and dislike x map is more interesting and stimulates discussion
gaiden chapter requirements are considered for the chapters they need to be completed in not the gaiden itself
the tower of valni and the lagdou ruins will not be considered for this tier list as well as that coastal map
we are not considering the story in any of these no matter how much you love/hate it
credit to u/mekkkah for the format every round we 're going to determine the best and the worst map left to be tiered .
so during the first round we will determine the best and worst maps in the game then the second round the second best and second worst and so on .
you get to hand out 3 points to your favourite map for the spot in question 2 for your next favourite and 1 for the one right behind that .
this way votes more accurately represent everyone 's opinions .
i 'll post an example just to make things clear .
let 's say we were using this system in the fe7 tier list and i think the best three units are marcus sain and kent in that order from best to third best while the worst are nino karla and wallace from worst to third worst .
as far as erangel that map is huge and i can be annoying to play sometime .
this got me thinking about how a map like that could be made fun .
3 paintball guns a sniper rifle assault rifle and pistol .
co2 canisters that have to be picked up to use with the guns but would have a variety of sizes
game mode 20 hits from paintballs will force you too lose
goal better/more cqc battles as long as sniper paintball guns have a nerfed distance making it more fair and balanced because of the actual gun being kind of cheap in cost '' but useful at closer ranges ie .
i figure that erangel would be way more fun because of this this would definitely allow for better open field tactics
i moved a portion of my bitcoin over to binance a few hours ago to get back to my original investment and diversify a bit .
been looking through this subreddit along with cryptoprimer.com to get the lay of the land .
i have a couple questions for you guys if you do n't mind .
am i right in thinking that today probably is n't the best day for me to invest in altcoins since they 're at all-time highs and 3 hours is n't enough time to do any thorough research ?
i 'm feeling some serious fomo right now especially with ripple .
could you guys recommend anymore resources or even better specific altcoins i should be focusing my research on ?
the difference between laws and principles is that laws are specific in situation and action and are therefore enforceable while principles are broad and unspecific and therefore unenforceable due to varied circumstances .
the laws jehovah 's witnesses follow today are ostensibly contained in the bible .
statements like the command to meet together '' and the command to marry only in the lord '' get thrown around as though they have biblical backing and the listener is expected to take that as such .
upon deeper investigation however a person will find that the quoted verses are not commands at least not in the way they were taught .
the 'command ' to meet together is actually presented in hebrews as advice to help not fall back to former sins and 1 corinthians is directed only at widows .
therefore for the majority of readers these instances do not apply in a law context but rather a principle context which removes the black-and-white enforceability from the hands of other humans .
instead it empowers a person to consider their own course of action in terms of gray .
you can get a ticket for going 51 m.p.h .
a police officer would need a more specific reason to ticket you than just saying you were n't driving safely .
in other words he/she would have to rely on a specific law to prove you were n't driving safely speeding driving recklessly following too closely 5 points in nj i know ...
and if i have n't belabored this point enough i offer this complication many officers won't pull you over for doing 51 m.p.h .
if you are exceeding the speed limit but still driving safely then they can make the judgement that strict application of law is unpractical in that case .
we find the opposite when we start looking at the jehovah 's witness code of laws .
in there we find many principles from the bible which are often good advice that have been reduced to black-and-white laws to make them enforceable think tobacco tattoos beards counting time birthdays etc. .
this removes the broad self-application of principle that separates maturity from immaturity and as a consequence pushes all to a state of child-like immaturity .
this is related to why children need to be told to not touch the stove while a mature person knows there are instances when you can touch the stove .
to wrap this up i believe it is a mistake to infantilize not a word ... people who would not normally be that way .
i am afraid that the organization does just that in an attempt to promote unity but what they do n't understand is that the bible describes maturity in terms that are the opposite of what they 're creating in their followers .
in the end they will have a loyal group that ca n't think reason or decide anything for themselves and anyone that does will be removed for disturbing the unity .
this post was inspired by u/pekanman 's post about disassociation .
hey looking to get rid of this 8 amazon giftcard .
it seems that deregulation of the internet is good so the repealing nn is only a good thing if it leads to the abolishing of the fcc .
otherwise the fcc is just going the way of all the other federal agencies being bought out in crony capitalist deals overstepping it 's bounds growing and growing in power gradually sucking away people 's freedom and ruining everybody 's lives in the process .

thanks in advance and sorry for the noob-ish question .
ok so to get this out there i have been reading/lurking for about a month and this will be my first post .
i 've just recently begun to realize how much my parents fit into the narc category in addition to being alcoholics .
i 'm not sure how common it is for the 2 to go together but it definitely does in my case .
anyway after an incident back in late march early april i went nc with my parents because they finally went off the deep end and my nm started accusing my wife of child abuse she 's not .
i can go into it later if it 's needed/desired .
since i sent them the nc letter explaining why and what they needed to do to come back into my/my children 's life i have barely heard from them .
with it now being christmas they got a subscription service to something for my kids .
it is actually something that dw and i had discussed for the kids separately .
i ca n't decide what to do with it everything else cards i 've sent back to them .
dw put it as she did n't want to deprive the kids i 'm worried that it will send the wrong message to the kids and the parents .
even though i have explained it as best i can to the older one dd is 8 ds is 4 she does n't understand .
i 'm of the mind to call and cancel the subscription just so nmom does n't think this is ok .
knowing her she will see this as a way to start weaseling back in .
i 'm already almost in tears over it and we only got the presents this afternoon .

two days ago i sent 100 eth to my coinbase account .
later on coinbase site the transaction switched from pending to completed but my account was never credited .
i then sent 1 eth as a test and it went through and was credited but 100 eth is still missing from account balance even though it says completed '' on recent activity '' on the site .
for the past couple of years i have been gaming on an imac and i decided it was finally time to enjoy some real performance .
because this is my first time i came to ask you experts for any tips .
any feedback or help is appreciated and i look forward to showing you all the final product !
when luke faded away at the end of the movie the dice also faded but why did the dice fade ?
my theory is that luke was never there on the island the whole time and died before hand .
when he went into the falcon he was the one to grab the dice originaly .
so the dice that luke gave to leia at the end of the movie were not real because he was a force ghost since the beginning and that 's why the dice disappeared .

i have really gotten in to gunmetal and brass clasps .
they give such an elegant yet vintage look to the jewelry i am making .
basic brass and gunmetal clasps are those simple finishing touch that can make your jewelry design stand out from the rest !
what great metal clasps have you all found ? ? ?
the bar is great for those close to mid range fights struggles with long range though
fg42 absolute beast at mid to long range struggles with close range severely .
m1941 very solid overall gun which i use alot for objective control not particularly amazing in any one area
stg44 prob the 3rd best ar in the game very good in close to mid range fights but faster fire rate but less dmg than the bar
if your very accurate with your shots then this gun will be a monster for you .
hard to fire off several rounds accurately in a short burst .
very little recoil but takes 3 shots unless your hardcore .
stv40 same as m1 grand but to me the recoil feels much more pronounced
currently at work and unable to check did hunt club get released for consoles today as well or anything at all for consoles ?
they 've literally never made any statements or indicated whatsoever that they want to get rid of fan made mods entirely .
even as recently as the skyrim co-op story they talked about how impressed they were with the mod and simply could n't give them permissions to have it on steam as it 's own standalone product .
plus every pr release about cc is bookended with we do n't plan on replacing modding '' or something along those lines .
people only say this whenever the cc is brought up .
the service totally sucks the content comes no where close to the quality of free mods .
it 's completely impossible for cc to completely replace fan made modding .
the sheer volume of content that comes from places like the nexus alone is n't possible to replicate on cc because of the cc 's various testing and licencing processes .
doing somerhing like taking down the nexus is completley against their interests not to mention would be nearly impossible .
the nexus supports more games than tes and fallout .
taking the entire service down to serve one company 's corporate interests would draw the ire of many different fanbases and game company 's .
all the content from the nexus is free so they ca n't pursue any legal action on that basis .
they 're reputation is already on shaky ground with everything about the cc so doing something like banning the use of free mods would be incredibly self destructive .
i am getting a gift for someone who loves weird foods and i wanted to toss in a strange green chile treat .
so i have like 3-4 accounts which are all around level 38 now and i didnt get a single skin shard from lvling up but wasnt this the reason they decreased the orange essence from disentchanting ?
my main account had 100 orange essence i decided to buy a snowdown capsule for 695 rp i got 1 skin i want so i disentchantet all of the other and in the end i still wasnt able to craft the skin i wanted .

i have been cheated on in all 4 of my serious relationships .
i have a very hard trusting a new woman when i am interested .
it is n't hard for me to meet women have them be interested in me etc .
but i just had another relationship end because i just worry when they are out '' without me and i do n't hear from them for an hour or two or they do n't text goodnight etc .
when my friends try to invite me they either are unable to as the invite button is broken or they get an error .
do other people experience this issue or is it just me .
tom marshall was doing a bulleit bourbon bottle signing at bottles and cases in huntington ny .
totally random event but it turns out the owner of the store has a great relationship with their bulleit sales rep who knows tom .
he chatted with everyone took pictures signed hats ticket stubs albums etc .
yeah nice little piece but i did think of those two pieces until right after you told me about it .
but i did tell him to take out the stem when clearing the bong and i did not say to smoke the bud without a stem like you would a plan pipe if he would happen to get a two piece down stem i clearly said when clearing the bong .
i 'm a lot more forgiving of higher prices with small companies like holy snails because their costs per bottle are so much higher .
the problem with elementals is that they 're way too fair .

who in their right mind think that fighting against this is bs ?
you think that 9,5 invincibility seconds for a champ is ok ?
with this w you do n't want to roam you want to go to your enemy that is on his turret burst him down with harrier marking him and then e to reapply harrier and them you just ult making the turret attack a minion so it loses the extra damage to champs and deal a massive amount of damage and then if the champ survive because it is a tank q and re apply harrier once more .
at least the actual quinn has counter play and outplay if you leave her enough time she is gone but 8 seconds without w in an escape situation is horrible is like making talon only crossing one single wall or kayn to do n't even cross the thinner walls while in combat it is not funny to have a cool ability that makes her be an allah akbar champ that she always was because she used to do max health damage why do you think they removed it ?
yeah because it became an spammable ability so having 100 total ad scaling would be op

yeah i do n't mean to bitch haha good jokes m8 but i got a notification from blizzard for a free winter veil treasure for hots .

turns out you get a rare treasure right away some more rare treasures for every 3 games etc you play and epic treasures for every profile milestone ? !
but if he 's on one of the tougher teams how does it become harder ?
no i mean statistical data that shows that pre-made groups of 5 playing against 5 single players win more games than they lose on average to a statistically significant degree ?
grew up riding mountain creek in nj and have watched the prices slowly hike over the years .
considering the conditions we normally have and how short the runs are i feel like that 's bullshit .
it 's not even remotely as large as places out west .
longest run is about 3-4 minutes from top to bottom so you wind up having to do laps to get your money 's worth .
i wish it would say hero6 on the front like the hero4 models .

so my daughter only slept through the night a handful of times up until she was 18 months old .
when she turned 18 months we deemed her old enough to cry it out .
we had exhausted every other option and no one was happy .
she cried for about 3 hours slept and then cried for another hour .
the day after she was tired but ok and the next night she fell asleep straight away .
we did n't get too excited but i do n't know how it worked .
she 's a lot happier and so are we .

my best friend recommended it many times so i eventually got the audiobook .
i 'm having a really hard time with it though .
the guy who reads it is entertaining but the content is not only a bit dry but also sometimes feels like it 's just stating the obvious .
i might give it another try but the first couple hours i would often just think '' well you do n't say ?
and was constantly hoping for some deeper revelation that never came .
cloned clan is to fight against super heavy engineered clans .
those engineered clans trick the system in such way that their offense is maxed and have maxed th11 at top so it is impossible to beat them plus they have engineered attack advantage from bottom .
so my idea is clan have ability to copy entire enemy offense and defense and use them during war so that both sides now have equal power .
since clan use this feature now they will get less loot and less perks but they can maintain their streak if they think they are better than enemy if they get similar offense plus defense .
this decision must be taken within 12 hours of prep day .
now only issue will be what if enemy also thinks the same thing so whoever use this feature first will earn this feature .

i remember the time not so long ago we had 1500 subs .
but every price tick upwards we now get moon posts and memes .
we should only do this when we reach real milestones and limit the memes imo .
the full answer is too long and off topic for the sub .
the short answer is the republicans in power are too attached to their jobs to leave too dependent on their billionaire donors to switch policy and too dependent on the 80 of republican voters who support trump to turn against him .
the few who might be willing to act ca n't do anything until democrats have enough of a majority to make up the difference .

true it is a country in dire need of an administrative reform and a reform of a lot of other things but it is a developing country still recovering from its colonial period .

jeg en mand havde langt hår engang og gik til en herrefrisør i rødovre centrum .

altså vi ka ' sagtens klippe det hele af men vi klipper ikke rigtigt langt hår normalt. '' .
heldigvis for mig var planen netop dét at fjerne det næsten helt .
forskellen er at herreklip tager væsentligt kortere tid så det ville faktisk være bedre og mere korrekt at kalde det kort '' og langt '' klip .

nimenomaan tässä verrataan eläimen oikeuksia jatkuvaa huolenpitoa tarvitsevaan ihmiseen jolla on paremmat juridiset oikeudet kuin eläimellä .
totta kai se on tasa-arvo-ongelma jos 1-vuotiaalla lapsella on paremmat juridiset oikeudet kuin lemmikillä vaikka niiden henkinen taso olisi samalla tasolla .
molemmat hankitaan tuottamaan mielihyvää omistajalle mutta toisin kuin orjien suhteen lemmikeistä ja lapsista tuleva mielihyvä tulee niiden mielihyvästä .
orjien omistaminen on moraalitonta juuri sen takia ettei niiden mielihyvällä ole merkitystä eli se on täysi vastakohta lemmikkeihin nähden eikä täydellinen verrokki .
vaikka väitteesi pitäisi paikkaansa se on argumentin kannalta irrelevanttia .
orjien vapautuksessa ei missään vaiheessa argumentoitu orjien mielihyvästä osa saattoi pitää tehtävistään ja taloudesta missä eli vaan argumentissa oli kyse orjien autonomiasta .
eli orja voidaan manipuloida pitämään siitä että hänen tehtävänsä on toimia toisen orjana millä häneltä riistetään oikeus autonomiaan .
yhtälailla lemmikki voidaan manipuloida että sen paikka on ihmisen orjana .
lemmikki oppii että antamalla tekemällä tiettyjä asioita hän saa omistajalta positiivista kohtelua .
ei mitenkään pystytä osoittamaan sisältävätkö nämä käyttäytymismallit mielihyvän kokemusta vai tuleeko mielihyvä positiivisesta kohtelusta omistajalta .
samalla tavalla kuin orja tekee mitä omistaja käskee jotta saa ruokaa eikä selkäänsä .
toiseksi on mahdoton osoittaa että lemmikkien tai lasten tuottama mielihyvä tulisi niiden kokeman mielihyvän kautta .
netissä on vaikka kuinka paljon hauskoja '' videoita joissa nauretaan lemmikkien ja eläimien kokemalle kärsimykselle joka tapahtuu ihmisen toimesta .
lisäksi väittäisin että esimerkiksi tarantulan akvaariokalojen käärmeen tai liskon omistajalla ei ole mitään hajua lemmikkinsä kokemasta mielihyvästä .
i knew they were making some type of story to the albums throughout the videos but i had no idea it was gon na be fully blown like they did its cool asf .

this dude put his gym bag in the middle of four yes four different machines so it was pretty much in the walkway .
like a normal person i assumed he lazily put it there .
i did n't know where he was so i jumped on a machine .
he comes from around the corner and started walking towards me .
so i said no one was on it so i 'm using it . ''
he says '' well my bag is right there . ''
it 's in the middle of the walkway you did n't even place it by the machine . ''
after that i pretty much told him i was n't getting off because i had already started .
surprisingly after we had finished our sets we both apologized to each other .
just remember how you felt after saying yes to switching the next time he or anyone else asks .
you do n't owe anyone anything at the gym .

i formatted this originally to share on my ig along with photos i 've taken and it makes it difficult to format .

it 's fine but people saying this is nothing new is definitely not accurate .
i 've played finished games that are worse overall than pubg or other alpha/beta games .
my point is that pubg gets a pass by microsoft because it is already popular but to my knowledge no console maker has ever allowed release of a game that is considered unfinished even by its developers.it treads a dangerous line for consumers .
that said if you want to spend your 30 bucks and try it out its totally cool .
how others choose their entertainment is not for me to judge
i 'm wondering is overwatch that popular than 1yr ago when it was just released ?
wow just wow i 'm now starting to see why this sub has become so toxic after being so enthusiastic and exciting .

my theory is he used the psp to contact the person because it 's the one device that ca n't get its history tracked plus why use his sister 's laptop if he 's using a different device ?
met someone online who offered to take him to an event in london .
probably said do n't bring your charger or buy a ticket home i 'll take you back home after the event. andrew ends up murdered his body disposed outside of london .
the guy who claimed to know about the case at the police station only to be sent away could have been the murderer .
he could have felt guilty for what he did and either a .

ottomans declared on me and i called hungary wallachia and karaman in .
i was really really lucky that they split their stacks and i wiped on in europe an routed the other one .

a personal anecdote does n't mean jack when trying to disprove something .
if your grandma says that she smoked tobacco everyday and is still alive at the age of 80 does that mean that everyone should do that ?
for that same reason just because you do n't act a certain way in a situation does n't mean that everyone will act that certain way in a similar situation .

my lil belgian mals is shaking his butt like a stripper when i came in with them .
so i guess i 'll delete the overly emotional part of my comment .
edit how are your lil guys or gals doing ?
and i 'm glad you do n't ignore the issue at hand like most parents .
your lil guy sounds like he just wants to say hi to his friends .
honestly i have a few reasons which might sound silly but here goes .
tigrex and narga were a very good addition to the monsters back in psp days and brought a whole new subspecies to the genre to hunt .
second thing the difficulty facing them for the first time .
the first time i ever faced a tigrex i was excuse my language here raped by it .
then it went in rage mode and boy let me tell you all i did was run around and panic jumping basically roll while running away from the monster i stated this becuase i do n't know if this changed over the years because i could n't find a window to attack before i had a good grasp of the monsters move .
same goes for narga he has something when i fought him other monsters did n't he was unpredictable for first timers since his attacks came from so many different angles at the time .
third which is n't tied to these 2 monsters but monsters that followed the fact that so many monsters came out on the nintendo versions that never was on psp meaning people like me who did n't own a ds3 will never be able to experience hunting them first hand if they do n't make it to the new game .
one last thing why khezu out of all monsters ?
i 'm 19 i think my grandmother was about 19 in this picture as well in 1971 ?
you got ta think about how japan has a smaller national economy and english language games are more easily accessible to the international market .
think about how 100,000 albums sold is platinum in japan while the usa needs 1,000,000 albums to be sold .
1. that does n't mean you do n't play him at all
its good for the players and they do n't have their pick .
that 's completely contradictory to how every dungeon has been designed ever in the history of wow .
its how pvp works m is different from pve content theyve done up to now its design to have 5 mans that can replace raids as a way to gear up of course its going to be different to every other dungeon
why do you think that because other keys exist that the problem can just be ignored ?
would you rather run a shit dungeon and not get any bonus rewards or run an easier dungeon and get more rewards ?
you dont get how the system works do you ?
wether it takes you 10 minutes or an hour you get same amount of loot they got rid of the bonus loot the only reason to beat the timer is to upgrade the key
and if you fail the timer who cares you still get loot still get the weekly chest and now you have a lower level key that you can try to push
you 're still very young and could do much better .
remember that you get what you go along with .
if you stay with an immature man child who is not prepared to be a man that is what you will get .
you can only change whether he makes your life miserable or not .
customer service is awful and trading fee is very high in comparison to others .
better than all of the 20 emotes where you just raise your hand .
there 's no good words to describe this level of scumfuckery .
how much more shit like this are americans willing to tolerate ?
that 'll make everyone quickly uninstall and run over to the pubg slideshow .
because we 're probably going to get bullied by the isps into paying more for what we have now or worst-case we have to pay more to use specific websites/services .
it also means that richer people might be able to pay more for faster internet and poorer people might end up with slower internet .
that 's all bullshit and would n't happen if the isps did n't have a monopolistic stranglehold on everyone in the country nn would be completely unnecessary in a fantasy land where there is real competition and consumer choice among isps but we do n't live in that fantasy land unfortunately but it is n't the end of the world .
your speeds probably gon na go down and your bill is definitely going up but it 's not the end of the world .
isps are in the business of giving internet access to people .
if they do n't do that they lose money plain and simple .
if only 1 of americans can afford internet access due to some lucrative price well that 'd be a pretty shitty internet .
the whole point of it is to interact with other people and that requires there to be other people .
and all of that infrastructure and all of those employees across the country would be for nothing .
so the people with internet access are getting a pretty shitty service and might not even want it anymore and the isps are losing out on a ton of money by just not letting people use the internet .
they 'll make way more money by selling internet to everyone than for selling it to only a few people at insane prices .
it 'd be like if your state suddenly decided to impose a 1,000 toll on all highways .
sure some people will still use it because they 're just that rich but why not lower it to 1 and have 100,000 times as many people use it ?
that 's 100 times as much revenue for no extra cost assuming the roads could already handle that amount of people which in the case of the internet it totally can .
so basically they 're not gon na take away the internet because that 's just not a profitable business decision .
your bill will go up and your speed will go down and that sucks but it is n't the end of the internet or anything .
and just to be clear i do think that we 're better with nn than without .
it 's not the best solution but it 's better than nothing .
first law of mentat is one of my favorites !
underlies the whole original series as well as life really .
so tao ... much zen ... sorry no shiba inu pic .
is there a significant different between that and a meatball ?
with a system that utilizes advanced hydroponics and/or aeroponics the issue of space can be solved ... kinda .
the benefit is the ability to generate on average enough food for 50 people with 1 acre .
material cost several kilometers of piping lots of wires several large water tank systems several small water pumps a consistent and constant electrical system a wide if not general large green house special fish special genetically modified veggies some way to treat biomatter for adding extra energy into the system a waste system etc .
the problem is when you want them to be renewable or semi-self-reliant .
as this will require fish and several more complex pumps to separate the whole system .
maintenance it 's not fun when any issue occurs .
as any major problem will result in your fish dying and requiring everything to restart .
tearing down everything will be a common trend and putting down fish may also have to come about to preserve the rest of the group .
hence why you might need to triple your material cost to separate everything against such issues .
health hazards you 'll need to have a constant supply of bio matter .
that needs to be treated and degraded over time .
i 've built two in my life and their still kinda standing to my surprise .
why is n't class guides included in the thing ?
yeah i honestly did n't mind the porgs and thought they were cute but i can see why they 're hated .
yes the r2 scene was awesome and nostalgic too .
as for the reunion it was good to see them together again but i do n't understand how leia could touch luke if he was a force spirit at the time i still liked it though .
i agree besides those scenes it was pretty dull and the leia skywalking scene just killed the movie for me .
the whole rose and finn storyline felt so forced and added little to the movie overall imo .
i like rey 's character and believe she can be extremely powerful but where she is as of now she just seems way too god damn powerful and for me it kinda tarnishes anakins legacy all the other incredibly powerful jedi .
because some random girl seems to be more powerful than they were at their prime with also having extensive training .
yep the film was definitely breathtaking but that does n't make up for the bad parts .
hopefully a few more viewings will change my mind but as of now i 'm very disappointed .
nothing wrong with those if you 're on a budget .
it was what i used before i went hotas .
stockhouse google stuff read the news visit the websites of the companies and review their investor decks .
sure you can support companies you truly believe in but the main goal is to increase wealth and that is perfectly fine .
if you make the palmette a lot largers and center it to the left it would be perfect .
like nothing could oppose him extracting information from rey so effortlessly ...
when a husband and wife fight and they ca n't stop fighting it does n't mean they love to fight .
saying if one of them disliked it they would have stopped ! ''
they fight because they feel the need to respond when my girlfriend comments and says kind of rude stuff .
not to mention this has ramped up quite a bit with getting more and more hostile in the past few weeks .
girlfriend comments this is disgusting how can you support this it hurts people what the fuck ''
dad comments thats just what media tells you you are ignorant etc ''
and then it just goes from there on and on .
its not like they are having nice healthy debates .
nah man we only assassinate the people who try to bring us together and tell us to love one another jesus lincoln the kennedys pope john paul ii john lennon etc .
honestly when you make a mistake and it 's pointed out to you your reaction should n't be so defensive .
everyone makes mistakes it 's not a big deal if someone points it out .
responding in defensiveness just makes you look like a baby .
i say this as neutral third party i 'm not the guy you were being a dick to originally though i predict i will be now because that 's probably the type of person you are ... . but you can prove me wrong if you want
kids that still believe in him will sometimes make a christmas list so that they can mail it to santa claus in the north pole .
it 's just what they 're hoping they 'll be gifted after being good '' for the year .
bonus fact just in case if you ever see elf on the shelf around the christmas season it 's a elf doll that you hide around the house that watches to see if you 're naughty or nice .
it 's played off as one of santa 's little helpers .
personally i would have been terrified as a child but it 's popular apparently .
i have no kids so take that with a grain of salt .
then there 's no way you will get all the rewards which works great .
well when i hear it 's been patched and working properly i will probably get it .
i waited this long i can wait a bit longer .
all of a sudden gruden is insufferable collinsworth is annoying and the rest are mute-worthy .

what people do n't realize is that even if you wipe out present scarcity in the world we 'd be back to a state of scarcity where some have what others wants almost immediately .
depends on what your matchup looks like imo if it going to be a close match i 'd go with burkhead as because he has a higher floor but if your looking for a higher ceiling play to make up some pts i 'd go with juju he 's more of the boom or bust play .
i also have not gotten over the disappointment of growing hips .
after this merger disney will possibly control more than a third of the box office .
a company that can do that can easily throw its weight around in negotiations .
full stack but not all that much front end .
preferably 8-10 years programming but 4 or 5 would probably be good to .
mostly matters for how much you 'd get paid .
there 's a bunch of business rules to learn .
the biggest problem is probably that the code base is around 15 years old .
it is ad software so depending on how you feel about advertisements some soul selling might be required ?
i understand the anti-assault rifle '' thing cause assault rifles are pretty much any rifle but i do n't understand the large capacity magazines .
my gf and i watched all of db/dbz and some of the movies .
i think the last movie we watched was the first broly movie so we still got a few movies to go .
then it 's on to dbs which i 'm pretty stoked for because i purposefully have n't been watching to let the english dub build up a bit .
hey everyone i was wondering if there are any printing services where can i print a pdf file .
yeah i kind of took a risk starting him but i 'll take it
in law it depends on the form of the acquisiton .
if the companies merged then your husband 's employment contract binds the successor corporation .
if the former company 's assets were purchased and the company woundup then the old contract ceases and a new one begins .
however the implications of this distinction are very complicated and fact-specific .
he 's still likely to be credited for service from the old company as far as the esa and reasonable notice is concerned
i 'm also considering between perine kerwynn and riddick .
abdullah is back so riddick is off the table for me .
i 'm leaning towards perine this week and kerwynn next week
if internet is a basic human right and third-world countries do n't have internet are people in third-world countries subhuman ?

you wo n't have the hangover most of us had !
when you turn 22 you 'll have to tell us how you 're going to be celebrating !
give a heads-up and we 'll celebrate with you !
it gives a whole new perspective that was n't explored before .
i do however think there might be some holes to this theory which i would be really happy if you can fill in .
we can tell this is n't monika since they 're only now just asking who you are and they know we 've been watching them in the game for a while now but monika knew that from the start .
this can be attributed to the fact that monika although aware inside the game she is n't totally aware .
as been speculated by tons of people before i learned it from this video tbh https youtu.be/w9awvi82udw it could be that monika and all other characters are from another game hence even if monika is aware inside ddlc she is n't aware of the whole picture as in her memories from any other game she might have been originally from which could explain why she sounds confused and not sure where she is .
it might be that at this moment in which she is talking to you it is n't the monika we know from ddlc but the monika who restored her full memory .
this moment could be the moment in which she regained her full memory and it is kind of cliche if you actually think about it since all characters who have had amnesia in any game anime manga ... etc usually act this way .
you see that in almost any form of media in which an amnesiac remembers their past in which they are confused for a moment and then they understand the situation .
that is why at first she sounds confused but then confirms that she knows that we have been watching them .
this is a stupid question since we 're the person who created his name .
and the fact they 're introducing them self when monika already did in the steam description shows it 's not monika speaking once again .
again you thought flow could be correct but in the same way as i explained above it could be that monika is regaining her memories at this point of time which is why she first tries to introduce herself but then disregards it since she knows we already know her name at least in ddlc .
the second line once again shows it 's someone we know from the game .
the character speaking to you is speaking to you after the bad ending '' of the game where monika deletes almost everything in the game and saves the mc from sayori we know for sure since right before monika re-deletes sayori she says i wo n't let you hurt him when she knows the person playing can be either a boy or a girl ca n't be hurt '' by sayori anyway .
i agree with you on the part regarding monika trying to protect him that she is talking about mc and not the actual players .
we pretty much spent the whole game helping the mc with interacting with the girls writing poems and helped him bring back the 3 girls monika deleted .
though in the end monika had to delete all the girls along with her in the bad '' ending .
however he was saved which is why he says everyone else is dead '' .
but aside from the mc who technically ca n't be deleted since he does n't have a character file we can see one other person defying the act of being deleted which is monika .
remember that after you delete monika when you reach the room with just her she does n't just vanish like you would think she would but she actually restores the game and the characters of the three other girls before disappearing '' .
also how the hell did she come back to save him the mc after sayori goes out of control in the bad ending if she was actually deleted ?
we do n't see any other character being able to do this once they are deleted except for monika .
even though in the fake ending we could see that sayori did start to gain similar powers like monika such as teleportation us to that weird room but she never controls it well like monika does .
so even though monika deleted almost everything in the game after the bad ending it does n't seem impossible for her to still exist even if her character file is n't there .
she might nit be visible to us or the other characters after her character file was deleted but it is nonetheless true that she was still there watching over us .
it is also interesting to point out that monika did all that even though she was truly deleted .
it was n't like the other 3 girls in which they were removed from the character files but not actually deleted as monika herself said along the lines of i did n't really delete them ... .i could n't bring myself to do that '' .
so monika definitely has some sort of power that defies being deleted .
they understood what was happening but the person speaking to does n't understand a thing about how this game works .
again there are two cases i can see here .
either monika is still regaining her memories and is still dazed from the surge of information that typically happens to people who regain their memories .
or the more likely explanation being that she is talking about the bigger picture .
since if we assume she regained her memories from any other games she might have been in she is confused about why she is in ddlc where is her real world and what is going on ?
remember that no matter how confident monika looked like or how much in control she was in the end she was still being manipulated .
manipulated into liking the player not the mc mind you since she and sayori after awakening in the bad ending express their deep desire to be with the player not the mc since they ignore the mc and talk directly to the player .
it is like a person who was put in a love spell awakening while still remembering everything that happen when they were enchanted .
no multiply that feeling by 10000 since in this situation monika is plucked from her world which is presumably another game put inside a dating sim/visual novel and brainwashed to like the player .
this most likely points out the main character knows that he has repeated this games story many times .
the deja vu '' effect is from you restarting the game over and over again .
i agree that that could be it but it also could be monika .
it could be talking about the original game that she cam from .
even if we restrict it to ddlc remember that in the game only sayori remembers that the player has replayed the game again and again to get all the cgs to get the good ending .
no matter how many times you save and load monika does n't confront us about that .
and remember monika has the power to even see you messing with the real game save and load files which are n't in the place you think it is at first .
monika is very open with you at the ending even talking about driving her friends to do awful things so why would she not confront us about this point ?
but after deleting sayori it could be she found out about it .
but i rather think the first theory is more accurate .
it 's true the 3rd eye was mentioned on http projectlibitina.com but that does n't mean the person speaking is also the female mentioned in the experiment .
the 3rd eye is most likely a way for him to see through time .
which could explain why this message is dated 2018 '' as him talking from the future which makes sense since this message can be found before getting to the ending of the game .
it also makes sense of this hidden saying in a file of the game what is a man without knowing the rich aroma of the future the hot complex balance of the present and the bittersweet aftertaste of the past ? ''
i honestly think this is the weakest point in your whole argument since it is hard to discredit the third eye as being just a link and nothing more coming from team salvato which has paid so much attention to detail .
it seems unlikely of them to just throw something so obvious out there as being just a link .
he knows you can do the games story all over again .
or it could be that it is monika telling you to go back and get the right ending .
it also could be referencing something in the new game so who knows .
this is the biggest piece of evidence showing this is definitely the mc talking to you .
to get the good ending '' of ddlc you must have seen all the scenes with sayori yuri and natsuki which will be in black white if you missed them in the bad ending .
to see those scenes you must complete all 3 character routes prior to getting to the room with sayori dead .
and all scenes involve the mc spending time with the 3 girls to make them happy which is what sayori wanted all along .
these sentences would only make sense if they were coming from the mc .
this could be talking about the other game in which they all came from .
the time spent is not with the mc but the time spent with monika in these other games .
she is trying to tell us to get them to remember that this is n't their original world and that they should remember their old world in which they spent time with monika .
now as for the other worlds '' line this is him talking about alternate timelines .
i also think it could possibly refer to other worlds as in other game files since after the ending of the game it expects you to reinstall the game .
the other worlds could also definitely mean other games that they came from .

rolo tomassi was absolutely amazing and the number twelve was fucking ridiculous .
if you 're debating on seeing them in their upcoming dates do it .
edit and for those curious 12 said they 're finishing their new album .
they go back into studio the day after christmas '' .
i think they knew each other at least close to the same time that he got the title of community manager at sledgehammer which was about a year or two after he made the character .
well he was asked directly and he said he can not give information but seemed to drop hints .
he said they have published a digital asset framework which outlines their criteria for listing assets and they do deep exams and surveys of the asset before listing .
he says he can not talk about if they will add any soon because it is material non-public information .
but he said we should expect over time they will add more assets .
he was actually asked twice about it and brian kelly asked if they will add bch since it is effectively bitcoin in a development way and asiff hirji said at a 100,000 feet that is probably directionally accurate '' lol .
probably for some of the reasons there 's a holy war between android and ios users .

this is obviously speculation but i would think the ufc would have told her that they were creating a 125 division especially if they planned on keeping her .

i 'll have to come back to this one when i 'm not on data .
this comment is false because literally only three people and isps wanted the vote to pass
however i also hold that there are legitimate criticisms to be leveled at zionism in general and israel in particular
sure but would you agree that statement is only true in the sense that there are also legitimate criticisms to be leveled at ireland and the irish national project or china and the chinese national project ?
the problem is not that israel is criticized israel is a nation and like any nation especially one dealing with hostile neighbors and terrorism there 'll be plenty to take issue with in its actions .
the problem is that criticisms of israel are taken wildly over the top and that double standards are applied which are not applied to other nations and that in many quarters these criticisms are considered an uncontroversial justification for eliminating the nation from existence or even straight up murder of its citizenry .
further i do think that at the very least the us is sufficiently hospitable to jews to be a viable and possibly superior alternative to israel as a refuge .
it depends on what metrics you 're using of course .
purely on the level of self-interest i 'm fine with bringing all the israelis here it 'd be a big advantage for the us and probably good for my personal political views too .
i suspect the israelis would prefer their ancestral homeland and the nation they 've built for themselves over the past seventy years though .

it was n't like had had just rolled ... he had adderall in his system which a comt inhibitor would prolong .
because idk if you knew or not but egcg inhibits both .
it 's not too strong for comt but if it 's an extract at a 50 egcg concentration it 's have some of the other polyphenols in it that are stronger inhibitors .
epicatechin and catechin are also found in green tea .
my point was just that he did n't need something to prolong it .

yes i do think that america has the potential to fall before europe but i also think they are the only ones that have the potential to save themselves .
look at paul nehlen for example.. he has openly associated with and echoed the same talking points as white nationalists and yet has connections like steve bannon and some little signs of support from trump .
he 's running for senate in wisconsin in a year and with news coming out today that paul ryan might resign he could pull off a huge win for the movement .
ive also heard that younger whites are much more conservative than previous generations.. and i doubt they 're conservative in the traditional sense of the word ...

i remember a cinemassacre video where james talks briefly about the japanese character ultraman but ca n't find it for the life of me .
if i 'm remembering correctly he talked about how ridiculously popular the character was in japan and he may have talked about the super famicom game as well .
i 'm not sure if it was an avgn video it could 've been just a cinemassacre video .
does anyone know if eth withdrawal is working yet ?
the transaction was confirmed via email 2 hours ago and currently stuck on coss.io as withdrawal automated processing '' .
i found out that eth withdrawal was halted on 07/12 https twitter.com/cosscrypto/status/938748542721626112 .
edit 1 6 hours later and the transaction has n't gone through yet .
i checked the receive address via etherscan.io the transaction has not been broadcasted so this seems like a delay from coss.io end not a problem with the ethereum network .
this was created on 12/15/17 so things are still being built around here .
all the info is on the side so feel free to post away !
i am wanted to build an 80 lower and i was going with the pf940v2 so that i can build a glock 22 in .40 s w obviously but my question so does it matter what trigger and lower parts i put in like are they caliber specific because i was looking at this lower trigger set and was wondering if it would fit https www.midwayusa.com/product/974065/glock-frame-parts-kit-glock-17-9mm-luger
my thought is that it would fit because the 80 that i have chosen will work for a glock 19 and glock 22
has anyone ever tried either of these things to help the symptoms of dpdr .
i know a lot of people get it from smoking weed .
but what if i got it independent of that ...

also doest anyone have any experience with ayuhausca and having that be a helpful experience to get over dpdr .
and i 'm on sertraline i know bad to mix ssri with ayuasca just curiouse !
now season 2 is out discuss all the revelations and machinations of the new season here !
think of who you are as a number in infinity .
when you are born you are that number you 're perfect but society and other people influence you so you start to change to your surroundings .
in your perspective you will always feel out of place because you are not your natural self you have others influences in your mind and they can be positive or they can be negative and make you insecure about yourself .
but remember you 're the only number 2 that exists or are you ?
you should also remember that we live in a binary world yin and yang on and off up and down .
so since you 're number 2 another number 2 also exists this is represented as 2 .
do n't think of negative as bad it 's just from a different perspective .
so whoever you are there is someone exactly like you but from a different perspective .
the more you love yourself the more you will notice .
look in the mirror and love every single atom in your body .
if everyone looked like societies standard of beauty then it would n't be perfect or unique .
your flaws and scars define who you are and your perfection .
you will be extremely similar and extremely different at the same time .
your favorite thing will be their favorite thing but you might have something else that you like that they absolutely dislike .
i do n't use the word hate because hate will not exist .
it is all love love in its purest form .
it will feel like a parental love or sibling love because your parents and siblings are really the only people who saw the original you before you grew up and got influenced .
the things you love about them are things you love about yourself the things you dislike about them are things you dislike about yourself .
you will trust them even if you never met them you just will because they are you from a different perspective .
you will value their opinion almost the same as yours they will never intentionally let you down they want the best for you you want the best for yourself .
just stop and think who do you feel you can tell anything to ?
who can you be the real authentic weird you around and not feel judged ?
when you were born did you have to make your mom love you or did she just love you exactly how you were ?
your ego will try to change or make it seem as though they dislike you or annoyed by you but remember the ego is n't you it 's just societies influence on you .
if you live your whole life through your ego you will always hate yourself and be insecure a way to help with this is to sit for a while and list everything you dislike about yourself everything you think is a flaw about you once you do that just remember there is someone out there who loves them more than you can imagine because they love the real you .
do n't listen to anyone 's opinion your soul knows what you want .
your ego is running from it because its scared .
i 've played gta 5 since lunch and went from ps3,4 to pc i 've uninstalled because i didnt find any point to play because i had enough to last and the updates did n't seem all that good at least imo
with the new doomsday heist out i was wondering if it was a good reason to reinstall the game and give it shot
do i need to send another if my fall semester grades are out by the time i apply right after i get my december lsat score .

desmond lead the 2000 strong army across mallister land a dashing figure in a suit of silver plate a purple eagle emblazoned on his chest and a cloak of purple billowing behind him as he rode .
it was n't until they neared the most fertile fields riders approached them fist 15 and then another 3 of the patrol that was there .
ser gregory one of the men that had escaped rode directly to desmond my lord 300 men claiming to be of house frey are at our fields claiming them as their own .
but their banners are missing a bridge between the towers and they have no horses . ''
desmond scowled staring in the direction they were to march we will get to the bottom of this . ''
before shouting back men we march to fight prepare yourselves . ''
it was not long before they arrived and the army carrying frey-esque banners scattered before the great host .
the battle was over before it even began as ser desmond lead the charge crashing through the few that remained clumped together .
of those that tried to flee over 100 were put to the sword and another 68 captured .
the men were taken down into the deepest cells of the cliffs beneath the keeps halls .
two prisoners were brought to a small cell together where they where kept gagged and bound for almost three hours before desmond walked in and dismissed the guards .
he walked behind one them the only sound the splash of his feet on the ground .
the other watched in horror as he pulled a knife from its sheath at his hilt and plunged it into the mans back .
the mans screams muffled by the gag in his mouth eyes bulging in pain as desmond seperated the ribs from his spine with careful cuts .
he passed out as the final cuts were made only to be brought back to consciousness as his face was dipped into a particularly deep frigid puddle on the floor .
finally desmonds hands pulled his ribs free from the mans spine reached in and pulled the mans lungs out as he fell limp on the floor .
arms drenched in blood he walked over to the man who had had little choice but to watch in horror and he spoke as he loomed over the man he will be dropped into a mass grave along with the others who died on our lands .
you have a choice tell me exactly who you are and what lord you serve or face a fate worse than his . ''
with that he removed the mans gag leaving smudges of warm blood across his face .

the window incident being a hoax was to me a huge revelation about elliot .
the movies flashback showed that he had issues before his fathers death .
grabbing his jacket and talking to mr.robot that young put the pieces together for me .
he only had one good parent growing up so he created another to compensate .
his guilt over betraying his real fathers trust caused mr .
robot to come out more overtly he was the one who pushed elliot out of the window .
darlene merely saw elliot throwing a fit and acting crazy but mentally he was fighting with his father '' .

that 039 s a common feeling for parents across america where quality child care is expensive and often hard to find .
the economics of running a day care have become even more difficult as state budget cuts undermine funding for child care subsidies .
now much of eastern kentucky is covered by what the center for american progress has deemed quot child care deserts quot census tracts with at least three times as many kids under age five than there are licensed child care openings forcing thousands of parents to depend on the kindness of relatives and friends or sometimes stay at home themselves .
new beginnings the day care center that shut down right before chitwood 039 s son was born was founded in the 1970s when the area was booming and a child care business could support a homeless shelter as well .
that doesn 039 t reach all parents who could use the help especially when unsubsidized child care costs more than 6,000 on average per year in kentucky according to child care aware that 039 s more than many mortgages in the state .
to alleviate the problem child care advocates have proposed beefing up federal investment in state child care programs to raise pay for providers and lower costs for families .

i have n't been here in a long time .
i thought it was because i could no longer relate to this sub anymore because my life was finally taking a turn for the better but this was not the case .
i was and am still going through existential crisis and i could n't relate to anyone in this universe to be honest .
but i guess it 's time i was honest .
and no amount of therapy meds or time will fix this i just know it .
i hate my parents for their decision to have seven fucking children .
i really wish they had stopped after my sister .
i hate everyone around me who always seem to pretend to know me and identifies themselves as family or friends .
everyday i 'm still alive it just feels so wrong .
so i read the faq and i have a few questions as im new to all of this .
1 it says you should n't store your money in coinbase but to store it in a wallet such as elw .
or do you store a certain amount/all of it ?
2 lets say i make some solid money and would like to take money out .
3 im looking to invest about 1000-1500 dollars should i put all my eggs in one basket litecoin ?
thanks for all of your time and sorry for the stupid questions im really new to this .
i been vegan for roughly 6 months now the main reason for my turning to a vegan lifestyle was to enhance my trail running performance/recuperation and it did improve .
i promise im not trolling but what would happen to all the animals that omnivores consumed if we all turned vegan a non vegan person i was talking to mentioned it is the circle of life and in a way he does have a point i dont agree but he does have a valid point .

im wanting to get better performance on gta 5 because at the moment its just constant stuttering which becomes worse and worse until its un playable .
im wanting to know which upgrade will sort the problem out the most .
im wanting to upgrade ram cause ive heard stuttering is usually affilaited with ram so im wanting to get an extra 8gb stick to make it 16gb .
would this fix my stuttering problem or improve fps ?
will start of by saying i am running a gtx 1080 and an i7 4790k .
playing with tweeked taa shadows and optimized textures mod .
the game was playing with no noticebale reprojection up to steam ss 1.1 however this made the game a bit too blurry for my taste and looked into other methods of boosting performance .
i disabled asyncronous reprojection and turned on always-on reprojection and the game now runs very smooth at 1.3 ss one weird thing however you have to untick it and tick the option again everytime you enter the game as it otherways will not work .
i hope this will help some of you enjoy the game even more !

i want to create a website for an organization that i formed recently the organization is really starting to grow so i want to expand .
i 'm a junior in high school so i honestly do not know much about creating my own website i usually just relied on website templates like weebly in the past for temporary projects .
now i really do want to go full out on professionalism .
i 'm sure a lot of you have created sites before so if you could just tell me where and how it would be greatly appreciated .
i really want a site ending in .org and one that does not cost too much .
i want to start the site soon and have everything published by new year .
i do n't even know if this is an appropriate subreddit to be asking haha but why not there are really smart people here that i 'm hoping can provide some help .
tradeback currently stuck resetting for a modest reshiram would appreciate the temporary synchronizer thank you

last year in january at age 30 i made the decision to work towards transitioning hormonally after having known i 'm trans for years and being open about it with my partner/wife of 10 years .
long long story short i now finally have hormones in hand ... but because we want to have a child around 3/4 years from now we decided i should bank sperm .
i went to the place called procrea and after banking two times i was told that my sperm had very low motility and basically would be suitable only for ivf .
my partner does not want to do ivf due to the cost and the health risks and i totally agree but the people at procrea gave me no information as to why .
so anyway when i tell my partner this she has a total freak out and is very sad and i feel bad for like failing '' her in this fucked up way that is clearly a vestige of being told to be the male provider my whole life .
and i know very well that we could adopt or she could use donor sperm or we could not have kids .
but this issue turned into a big fight about like why ca n't i wait and see if i can raise the quality of my sperm why ca n't i transition after we have kids and all this shit .
i just do n't know what to do now .
since i 'm nonbinary my dysphoria is maybe not as extreme as others i have n't been happy but i 've coped for years without starting on hormones despite always thinking about it and part of me is like this is important to both of us why ca n't i just suffer a bit longer ?
another part of me is like fuck this breeder logic of needing a biological child .
except then last night when we made up my partner was sobbing and saying i just see us being happy you having transitioned and a child we made together .
i 'm venting i guess and who knows if this is just a problem we would of faced whether i was transitioning or not .
i know that in the past i tried herbal hormones and shit but ... i do n't know .
if anyone out there has any experiences with sperm banking while trans which is unpleasant enough as is or navigating all this i 'd love to hear them .
i 've done two reddit secret santas one imgur and one on another website and every year i never get anything in return .
yes i know that the point is giving and not getting things but god dammit please dont sign up if you dont intend to send anything .
or if you have money issues you can message your santa and let them know its going to be late !
one year my rematch santa never pulled my info .
i 'm tired of spending money and getting nothing in return .
anyone have good recommendations for a barcode scanner app for inventory management .
not looking for price comparison but more keyboard emulation/input .
have a little customization to tab over to the next cell or carriage return automatically
have ocr capability when a barcode is not present nice to have
i dunno i think it 'd be pretty cool .
we 're a chill supportive community and i know for a fact my life has been drastically improved thanks to many of the wonderful people i found through this sub .
just curious if there are going to be/are any oculus rift headset deals for the holiday season ?
i was going to buy one last month but unfortunately my computer experienced the dreaded bsod due to a dying hard drive so i had to wait and it kills me i did n't buy it while i had the chance .

i will attempt to explain how to trigger and prevent ot in clam blitz .
if your team has the lead and you have possession of a power clam and the enemy team does n't have possession of a power clam then there is no overtime .
if each team has 1 or each team has 2 then it goes to ot and the losing team has a chance to bring it back .
if you have a power clam and the lead in the last minute try to defend and retreat with your clam so you win with no ot .

another post kinda inspired me to do a year hold thingy next to my main portfolio .
i 'm going to pick 10 long terms this week and hold them for about one year .
just name some coins if you want a short description i 'll do my research .
after picking i 'll also post which ones i chose and why .
unfortunately i missed the pre-sale so let 's see where this will go .
does n't really have an explanation top market cap coin .
i 've been following nav for quite some time .
great potential when used in actual life and i can see the various uses of it .
the road map especially q3 and q4 2018 seems quite promising to me .
think this is gon na be longer then 1 year hold .
i like most things i see although i 'm not really familiar with all the tech mentioned .
i like the idea behind this it 's simple currency .
supply chain another coin which can make a difference in the businessworld .
i think coins like this which tend to make a difference in the accounting world have quite a big chance .
send me offer with keys pure or more in liquid items high tier items .

i can think of three instances of them saying it .
dennis tells frank to go fuck himself in his fat fucking ass .
dee saying that mac looks like he 's fucking himself with a dildo bike .
after killing a flockleader geerin it dropped a godsword shard 2 .
i do n't understand why i ca n't have both .
if i have bodily injury liability i am insured if i hit someone .
but if i do n't have uninsured motorists bodily injury i 'm not covered if someone who hits me has no insurance .
i want to be covered for bodily injury when someone hits me though .
i killed 13 graceful followers of armadyl all called kree'arra .
is there an app or some other way i can forward sms from my android to my iphone ?
i do n't feel it at all if anything it makes me feel more disconnected like i 'm just an observer of my life and the world .
people also tend to blend in more with the scenery as well like animals do or characters in a book/story .
that being said my highest dose has been 150ug does it need to be higher ?
i levelled my fletching skill i am now level 42 .
i 'm planning to travel for a while maybe for a long time .
now wondering if my exchanges will be accessible from everywhere so from every country .
or are there some geo location restrictions for exchanges ?
and if yes how about using a vpn server .
or could maybe an exchange find out that you 're logging in through a vpn and then will maybe lock your account ?
i 'm especially interested in knowing for the following exchanges

be prepared for a shit ton of spinfoil/half cocked theory
while i was patrolling around the vast expanses of mercury i noticed something that caught my eye .
i saw a large sphere shaped vex construction that was sitting off near one of the many precarious edges of the map .
nothing seemed out if the ordinary as i strode by but after going around to kill a yellow bar centurion i noticed something .
a smaller sphere inside the cracked casing of the larger orb .
similar to the traveler in the simulant past as well as oozing out copious amounts of radiolarian fluid that cascaded of the map edge .
all of this got me thinking the vex have been described as above the light vs .

iota is a trailblazing idea but its development worthless without economic legislation .
taking the idea from dash paying the nodes is not possible with iota if transactions are for free .
building an ecosystem on donations will not be successful in long term because there is no economical inducement to donate .
my suggestion every wallet has to be a full node no light nodes anymore !
otherwise the consensus donor and the user would be apart again and there is no incentive to run full nodes if you can run a light node without running an own full node .
easy to install and use for everyone even without previous technical knowledge
runs without static ip and looks for neighbors by itself .
furthermore one of the most important tasks is to create or support hardware wallets .
the next important thing is the sequence of development .
first the basic system should run stable actually between humans .
the usage between machines builds on this but is not the cause .
that means.. groundwork first stable running network and the roof second m2m use data marketplace etc .
if these points are not met another one will adopt the tangles technology and steal the show .

so this guy i know met a girl on an arrangement website .
basically he had sex with her and gave her money in exchange .
turns out the girl had just turned 17 mind you the girl lied about her age and the guy is in his 40 's .
now the girl is blackmailing him and demanding money in order to not go to the cops with proof .
they met up at a hotel that had cameras in the parking lot so it would n't be hard to get evidence .
they live in california where the age of consent is 18. who would get worst punishment in this situation if they both came clean ?

wait it out and hope for a remaster or get the bundle ?
my goal with this one was to make a more generic '' version of the list that is less tied to a specific characters backstory .
this version is a very literal representation of the cycle of violence and will hopefully become very important and personal for any long-time wielder .

i am not catholic nor am i baptized but i am fairly sure i believe in jesus and am considering joining the catholic church .
i have always suffered anxiety and ever since i found religion it has been manifesting itself as a crippling fear that i will go to hell .
i tend to picture hell as a literal realm of never-ending fire where souls suffer for eternity without the slightest hope of relief .
now that i think about it this has been the main reason that has driven me to believing .
i do love god and i am grateful for all that he has given me and the rest of humanity but those facts are secondary to me not wanting to go to hell .
it 's the thought of eternal suffering that i am terrified of .
because of the concept of hell alone i actually find the concept of afterlife in the christian sense much scarier than the thought of your consciousness simply ceasing after death as many athiests believe .
i would honestly feel better if the majority view of hell was simply a state where you are separated from god instead of literal suffering or the idea that hellfire simply annihilates your soul and you cease to exist .
to make it worse i am unbaptized and with all the talk of the end times i fear that i might just wake up to the second coming one day and be condemned to hell .
even after baptism i feel that i will be afraid falling into a state of mortal sin if i take the lord 's name in vain for example which to me is the easiest way of committing mortal sin and dying or the end times approaching before i have had a chance to go to confession or even making a confession improperly or worse getting baptized improperly and thus invalidating it .
i know that this reason for believing is not a good one and that god genuinely does n't want me to feel this way but every time i think about god i simply can not avoid thinking about the agony of hell .
i do n't know how to resolve this and i do n't really know any catholics in person so i ca n't really ask for advice .
how do i resolve this fear and believe in god for the reasons that god wants me to believe him for that he is the creator of all and is the only one deserving of our worship and that he died for our sins and paid for us a price we could never pay ?
that means none are scheduled as of yet to come to your zip code .
did you try the right ref number for your game/game pass
if so we should rename the breed to have that name .
i think you go back to how you were before you were born like spirit without body exept after you live your life your personality is different than what it was before .
what is the advantage of holding the coins and going through a vpn to register ?

getting an awkward bogner whenever i 'm around even a mildly attractive gril
well we 're not in the clear just yet lol .
if you 're familiar with my eth posts i like the aths hold for a week before accepting a successful break .
my friend said mortal kombat during that scene so yeah .
if we lose the team will i have to put on clothes !
that may be true but i have a strong feeling he can back this up .
the major bottleneck is bandwidth for the mempool to sustain anything over 1gb right now .

the institute just added their own organs to make it easier .

as long as you roleplay even some of those personality traits you 'll do better than most players ever do .
no congress usually has the final say in everything .
the fcc has to basically approve it to go to congress by casting their votes .
if they vote to repeal it like they did then it will go to congress aka the higher ups .
bush w and bill clinton also said the same thing but neither were stupid enough to make it official us policy .
so if h. clinton or b. sanders had become president i imagine they would have done what their predecessors did and carefully negotiated middle ground between the two sides rather than going full retard like trump and getting people killed .
if either had made this move i would gladly have called either of them a fucking moron for doing so .
and there you have the difference between the left and the right .
a jewish state does n't mean a halachic state .
israel being a jewish state is by jewish cultural tradition language and history .
no different than a france being a french state or england being an english state .
they are strict about sticking to bitcoin only dialogue .
no alts even if the content about the alt coin is well received and helpful .
if i put the nail in the stem it 's super loose and the dome piece thing does n't go on it you have to drop the nail inside the dome thing .
and there it goes now everything looks like garbage .
polls taken show many muslims have many very concerning beliefs .
this is just my personal opinion i think it looks great but would be even better without the boarder .
so just to be clear because i get confused by this this means transitioned to male ?
wo n't ever happen it would cost them too much money people buying tickets online and deciding something came up and they are n't going to go because the ticket is free .
so many people would start abusing the system to get rewards ect
the 800 of 9 different ships means your paying 9 different docking fees .
there obviously going to be a balance between fair grind and too much grind .
cig would need to be careful with that balance .
that would give a better indication of pay 2 avoid grind .
all evidence indicates that ship hull would be a minor expense compared to ship maintenance and equipment .
those who have bought multiple ships would find difficulty maintain those costs and they probably end up selling them to fund larger ships maintaince .
we seen that missions take a long time in this game .
it appears voyages will be long experiences in one ship.i would assume computer equipment and accessories would have far more impact than ships .
you see people are buying one dedicated combat ship one exploration ship and one hauler for example as a way to cover multiple careers .
the problem too is that economic growth is measured in gdp .
when the rich get richer it gets captured in the gdp does n't matter if it 's one person or a million people .
we need to stop using gdp as the headline indicator for how well the nation s doing .
have you played on the patch that released yesterday ?

larger mics or mics extended out on magic arms not as fine .
a major advantage with a cage or rod rail system is being able to quickly detach a camera from loads of added gear .
mics external recorders lights monitors all left behind with the quick turn of a thumbscrew or two without having to uninstall each component individually .
all that gear can remain installed on the cage .
cages provide for quick and easy setup and teardown .

i agree some people will swap cars later for the awd and p models i do n't think a ton will but it will happen .
that said the person willing to take that kind of depreciation hit on the car to drive it for 8 months would probably have just purchased an s. the biggest depreciation is when you roll off the lot so go lose 15k then add another 10k so you can get awd taxes ...
i feel like most people with either wait for the awd or would already be in an s/x today .

do you like something because you 're used to it being the standard or is it the standard because you like it so much ?
clubs may use a portion or all of their available tam to convert a designated player to a non-designated player by buying down his salary to at or below the dp threshold 480,625 in 2017 .
if converted during the secondary transfer window the dp in question may earn a maximum of 1.5 million on a prorated basis .
if tam is used to free up a designated player slot the club must simultaneously sign a new designated player at an investment equal to or greater than the player he is replacing as a dp .

i watched it last night and again this morning and i 'm right there with you in that i enjoyed far better the second time .
with the second viewing and the time i 've had to digest it i 'm really starting to see that it 's positives heavily outweigh its flaws .
in particular i really started to grasp the theme of failure as expressed in the yoda/luke interaction .
one thing that continued to bother me was the unnecessary disney-esque humor wished they toned it down just a bit and the finn/rose subplot .
other than that i absolutely loved the character development specifically kylo ren 's .
i always believed he was by far the most interesting character in this trilogy so far and they have developed him into such a complex villain who 's motives and extreme anger are reasonable and understandable not just evil for the sake of being evil .
as a huge kylo fan i 'm satisfied with it played out and super excited with how his character goes in ix .
it 's always enjoyable but when the temperature is just right and the snow is hard enough yet soft enough you can kind of 'pop ' it as you go over it .

as far as we know there was n't a minerva for the 1800 's but that was the one time we 've seen ananke directly set the gods up for death by bringing back hades/out last true woden that became the monster .
1923 minevera was very excited to die maybe because she gets a break for 90 years ?
the flashback would suggest when she gave up being a regular god she was small like minerva .
of them all she seemed closest '' to baal who was easiest to manipulate but we also had mini telling laura not to hurt baal emotionally .
jon 's story would suggest ananke can choose who becomes a god perhaps she chooses the most unstable people like ruth and cameron on purpose so it 's easy to get 4 sacrifices but so far the great darkness has only went for mini/ananke and baal 's father .
then there 's also ananke 's suicide note unless it was for jon and he somehow let her take over mini ?
and now he 's playing his father laura and cass because stockholm syndrome ?
they lost my iphone when i made the switch to the note .
they wo n't reimburse me no matter the proof i show them .
i mean do u get the 10ad at level one or like 2 ad level one and then 1 per level scaling .
just curious to optimize the levels one through three in lane phase
i said if that was all true she would have been doomed way sooner than 112 .
you do n't state your name in the confessional and you ca n't see each other .
that is not from the heater or blower motor recall .
i would guess it 's from a bad dme engine computer stuck on for the coil .
my friend wanted to np 2 his caster gil got him right after he got eresh everytime he summons something i summon too worked with merlin a m tamacat so i tried and got her too .

i ca n't figure out why it 's there so this is the only thing i can think of .
to answer this question i 've had stable coverage on every possible route to charlotte and to norfolk dc and snowshoe wv .
sounds like the new owner of these stations did n't like the terms of the old agreement .
pretty sure he had ample opportunity to penetrate that circle so in reality he deserves the punishment .
what toys does she use during the time you 're away from her ?
well if so what size plug is she using ?
most people go for a wider bulb on the plug when really that only helps on insertion/removal the rest of the time it does n't do anything to get your sphincter accommodated to something bigger .
she needs to get something that does n't have a narrow neck compared to the bulb .
a dildo would honestly be the best but there are plugs that fit the bill .
if she 's got a vibrator on her clit she should be easier to enter .
of course if you 're trying to get in as she 's hitting her orgasm it 's probably going to be more difficult .
nice to see this mentioned yes it 's very good !
his first stream back will probably have 200k or more viewers
this is a weird one because i could see myself doing that to my child .
my six year old has a problem keeping her clothing on at home .
also we have a 2.5 yr old who has pull ups and she definitely escapes the potty naked and i 've totally lightly spanked her while she squealed and ran away .
the hot button political issues still have real-world consequences that the republicans are trying to rule with an iron fist .
it was a good delivery '' well it could have been a good delivery if it was not a fucking no ball heals .
monero is the only fungible cryptocurrency ever and these contracts are a nice way of obtaining it without going through aml kyc thingers so thats your call .
it was more recent where he said that over time he came to like what johnson had done even though he was initially resistant and did n't like it .
now whether that 's entirely true or the mouse was hovering is another question .
i 'm sure it 's hard to anyone who 's been associated with a character for decades to have something go opposite expectations for that character .
there is only like 90k xboxone in japan versus ps4 5.5 millions .
xbox is literally dead in japan selling like 200 units per week .
switch 's sales per week literally outsold xone lifetime sales there .
even when speaking of worldwide sales ps4 also have double the number of xone .
also japanese games does n't really have audiences in xbox one .
there is a reason why japanese developers do n't bother with xbox one unless you are juggernaut like square enix even then i read the split between ffxv is like 80-20 in favor of ps4 or your game have western appeals resident evil dark souls etc .
children will always be the priority over single men or women .
but of course children are usually attached to their mother .
in fact shortly before tfa they had less than 10 fighters .

it says a lot about the rift 's entertainment value if all of these rift owners would rather spend their friday night review-brigading this game instead of playing something on their rift .

luckily they were not rat shot otherwise the whole block would have been leveled .
eventually we will but now for several months since we have to finish the classes first and they do n't start til mid january
there i was thinking it was just some really obscure erotica turns out i 'm just undereducated !
sorry for a late comment op but there are a few lean cuisines that are pretty low .
the herb roasted chicken is 2 points for a small-medium chicken breast with veggies and potatoes .
i also like the glazed chicken which is chicken and rice although it 's 5 points .
i 'm allowed 45 points per day so i understand it 's a lot harder to fit these meals into a 23 point allowance .
you could probably write a book about what the lord is thinking when he does things .
you do n't see the point in a crypto currency that can complete transactions in 3.5s ?
when you buy stuff online do you want to have to wait 10mins for your purchase to clear or 5 hours as is currently the case for bitcoin or do you want it instant ?
xrp is the only crypto so far that actually has the potential to be the money of the internet '' because it can actually transact in real time .
the other crypto 's are almost all essentially gold with extra steps '' .
bitcoin is a thing '' given value simply because it is finite .
xrp is given value because it actually performs a function .
as far fetched as it sounds if a million different dominoes fell right xrp could someday replace all global currency .
there 's no way bitcoin could do that it buckles under the load it faces already .
i do n't know if this is actually helpful but carlo rossi is a cheap really terrible california wine .
according to this http www.carlorossi.com/where-to-buy they distribute to st. louis first zip code that google suggested maybe you could find some nearby .
around here it 's about 9 for a gallon which might be cheaper than ordering a carboy online because glass can be expensive to ship .
you 'll also need rubber bungs and airlocks which you can easily get from amazon .
another option is to buy a gallon of water and use both the water and plastic it comes in .
really getting over the let 's shit on russ circlejerk on this sub right now i would n't mind it so much if half the posts were from people who clearly do n't watch our games and think that russ is the only reason for this shit .
seriously watch some basketball before you make these kinds of posts
she needed both ashley and ryan at the end with her to have a shot .
i think she 'd lose to ben mike and devon .
https i.imgur.com/6sfzrgw.jpg because reposts are a fact of life around here but we can all at least strive for quality .
the fact that op has n't replied to any of the comments makes it seem more like it 's a stolen image karma grab .
you know what i find funny is that nobody 's answering this seriously .
everyone 's just giving him shit for a question that is actually pretty legitimate .
give him an honest answer as to why it sucks so much .
they wo n't take new on the spool wire most of the time because it 's usually stolen from work sites .
people bringing that in usually have to provide proof of the company they work for .
only read the first zahn book ... total garbage imo .
i think it 's great that we 're tearing down our expectations in the new movies .
is n't that how we made dogs in the first place ?
kill all the wolves that bite us but feed the ones that do n't .
one time someone recommended cbt and i ended up on a cock and ball torture site after googing .
and why do municipal governments make those agreements and sign those competition-stifling contracts ?
because of corporate lobbyists and the they get from comcast and at t .
and somehow you think the solution is to give comcast and at t more power ?
honestly though it 's hard to blame comcast for demanding these agreements .
why would comcast agree to spend 100 million laying cable across a whole city if the municipality is going to let a whole bunch of competitors use it ?
so i 'll repeat again slowly this time if the municipality owns the line we can have this multi-isp fantasy wonderland .
as it stands though the isps own the lines and they control who uses it .
decreasing regulation wo n't help more isps get involved it 'll shut the door to them .
honestly i never thought about it that way before .
it 's been 2 weeks do you have a trip report ?
were you already in ketosis before you started taking them ?
it 's a lie that they will induce ketosis by themselves .
you can only do that by depletion of glucose in your body using diet and lifestyle .
adding ketones in to your system without being in ketosis will just delay the burning of the glucose that is in your body .
i doubt they cause weight loss by themselves they are an energy source so how can taking an energy source induce weight loss ?
i 'd expect the other benefits to come through though focus energy and a decrease in inflammation .
basically i would find a could guns and wait by the building .
when i see someone going in i would let them loot the whole place .
fine if he ran the pick and roll properly and passed out of drives more .
he and adam should already run the pick and roll better tho .
he would have to stop the mid range jumpers .
and trader joe 's sells an excellent box wine .
literally everything you mentioned can be traced back to barry or barry 's lack of action to undo shrub jr 's shit .
when did the obama admin do anything about things liberals on reddit screeched about constantly when bush was in charge but now apparently do n't give a flying fuck since their guy is in the wh ?
she thinks she can time travel and dimension hop .
her social media posts read like an escaped mental patient who refuses their meds write them .
i 'm dying to play it but 60 dollars is just too much for me atm
if they have a free shipping on x order and you need other laces stock up .
it should n't be a tv show but it could be really neat as a web series to watch and wait for on the off-season of the show .
i think a short and sweet web series would be better than a full-fledged show anyway .
they could have certain chapters '' of the web series to show the background of negan or something .
you mean ... the story sucks in my opinion . ''
my name is byf the guy who studies lore and story ?
i 'd actually be inclined to say both opinions are equal .
hence why generic statements like the story sucks '' does n't resonate to me .
your calus point is flawed in that we are in a war with cabal .
tell me how you fight an entire alien species and then another faction shows up and immediates goes to eat up one of your planet for the lols .
calus did n't just wave a peace flag and come on friendly terms and cabal are n't friendly with us .
maybe if it was the fallen and they did n't instaattack us ?
you 'd have a point but nah you do n't .
i just put stock in byf because he 's a popular youtuber .
if you do n't want to put stock in byf 's opinion ?
then you might as well discredit datto 's mesa seans mtashed and others .
he 's basically on their level except he specifically involves and indulges in the lore/story so i value his opinion in that department much higher since he can understand certain nuances that normal people can't/do n't .
dungeons and dragons had rounds of 6 seconds and turns of 10 minutes .
basically rounds for combat and turns to keep track of out of combat time .
wtf even the artists themselves on the tracks ... smh
i really hope the proper outlets/authorities see this so something can actually be done to help this little girl .

yeah it 's not his assistant though that is his wife who pops in from time to time .

resting bitch face stand-offish yet extremely emotionally open and sensitive .
1440x2560 is my preference but whatever you make i 'll be happy with !
literally anything you say about him is conjecture because nothing is revealed about his personality at all .
i think op means that they 're is giving away some as gifts to other people .
the construction industry over here got used to big fat profits 30 in the days of high oil prices .
that was not seen anywhere else in the world .
now they consider a more common 5 margin not worth it .
they have to get used to the new more sustainable normal .
i 've just been experimenting with android auto lately ... it seems like the play music integration is kinda half assed .
how is there no way to play specific radio stations or albums or artists ?

all you need to do is get a bottle of the descaling solution and run through the steps it lists clears it right up .
i think what info_mation is saying is that a pm is not classed as an engineer .
you can be trained as an engineer and be working as a pm in the same way that you can be trained as an engineer and be working as a hairdresser but you are still doing project management and not engineering .
insurance would probably just be invalid if the window was open in an empty house .
i had a teacher kick the back of my chair because i did n't do my homework .
i did n't tell my parents because i thought my father would have brought his 357 to school and straight up murder my teacher .
in hindsight he probably would n't have i do n't think he has a desire to kill
been doing same sorta shit since i was kid use yo be ashamed but i accept it now
the other car didnt have lights because he/she forgot them while the mechanic did a poor job of repairing the breaks .
maybe that doesnt apply to your relatives but if you add poor responces from the drivers or not having seatbelts or helmets you can get the full picture of car accidents .
i never felt pleasure during piv i think if it were sti related it would kick in later .
also i could feel pleasure during oral a couple of months ago but i was completely relaxed .
i 'm just wondering how a normal and healthy erection should be like .
i actually did download my first wallet just after this article in november .
the rest is fuzzy i went to buy 200 bitcoins the laptop was stuck i got bored and deleted all that nonsense .
why is the lighting so much better in horizon 3 than fm7 ?
even though it is a 600 rpm archetype it has zen moment which makes headshots so freaking easy .
we need this for all heroes apparently so they start fixing their game .
kind of why i really hated people begging for new skins .
i would much rather like a year of nothing but bug fixes than skins .
you and your ilk may never be pleased but at least it felt like a star wars movie starting things off right .
it especially worked if you believe ‘history repeats itself ' .
the movie was good in pacing it respected the ot and had a solid story arc .
you can get pissed for it being like a new hope but that should be viewed as a good thing .
it avoided the pitfalls of the prequels and the ‘different just to be different ' approach of tlj .
i much prefer safe and solid over the alternative essentially what we just got from rian .
i 'll gladly take a ‘remake ' of rotj if it feels like star wars and it can undo or soften the recent missteps .
sadly i think too much damage has been done from tlj .
again i think my theory that the 70s-80s kids generally liked tfa and have issues with tlj .
anyone born in the 90 's and later millennials have the reverse opinion it seems .
edit i knew i should n't have mentioned millennials .
that hyper sensitivity they have only ensures down votes no matter what .
steven that 's a beautiful work of art you 've created there .
i have two mothers and i could say my family is ok now compared to 10 years ago .
it was n't easy as my mother was the first wife and my dad did n't really do it the most transparent way .
i have held a grudge against my dad for over 10 years before my mother said lets just let the hate go .
i would n't say we 're happy but there is some benefits .
i know a lot more cousins and relatives now .
some of them are really good friends with my mom and i can see they genuinely value the relationship .
i have since let go of the hate towards my dad since my mother has accepted it sometimes it still gets to her but most of the time she 's okay .
have a discussion with your wife if you feel theres anything lacking in your marriage i would say .
your kids will be the most affected if not your wife .
for example nem xem coin does weekly update news on youtube .
the investers can see what 's going on and what 's gon na be .
because with this progress you can bring more investers or more interest about the thing you do .
of course your market cap will grow faster with your development .
they are offering it next semester i 'm pretty sure !
i was just wondering if anyone else was down for round 2 of the horror show that went down this sem lol
i 've never tried dillys because i 'm not an iv user but i hear they are amazing .
i do n't know that completely broken and minor issue are the same thing .
i doubt they 'll be sold out microsoft has been planning this debut meticulously for years with literally the entire phone team focused on nothing but this .
however in case they 're sold out i 'll let my family watch whatever x86 apps they want to see me run on mine .
evidence based medicine is literally the cornerstone of medical research today .
the dumbest reason i've blocked someone is because they called me out for being wrong about something but was a real condescending dick about it .
i blocked them as a means to exit the conversation .
i was wrong about something to do with fps in video games vs fps in film i do n't remember exactly .
i wo n't presume to know if it 's important or not when a friend just needs to hang out .
i do n't brush people off just because they are being emotionally weird and it 's no fun .

his portrayal of snape even if you are not a fan of the series was so spot on it was scary .

this guy is saying that they used tones '' and vibrations '' .
were these tones coming from a boom box outside the cell or were these tones simply random background noise from other things going on in the facility .
the cells do not have 4 foot thick walls to keep noise and vibrations out .
furthermore i have a somewhat hard time believing that the us would use these tactics .
compared to waterboarding this crap is so mild mannered it almost seems like it would be a waste of time .
if this guy said the us pulled out his finger nails and broke his toes i would completely believe it .
devereux started the game 322 runs behind warner on australia 's all time scorer 's list .
he is only 150 runs behind warner right now .
the odds that he might go past warner in this series are high indeed .
hit them on their touch ac where it hurts .
as someone who had to struggle briefly in a similar situation that you are in i can completely empathise with you .

tokopedia has an official tp-link store and there are plenty other sellers that sell specific models .
as for brand tp-link is the more popular one around here second to asus i think .
for tp-link i would recommend getting their gigabit routers which is unfortunately a bit above your price range 550k and up .
models i recommend would be either the wr1043nd or archer c2 ac750 if you 're willing to spend a few extra ks .
if you 're feeling a little risky you could get a router which could support the installation of a third-party firmware which can have extra benefits for you which you can check here https lede-project.org/toh/views/toh_fwdownload .

you can tell who made a borderlands weapon simply by watching the bullet hit .

i dont recall the rest but its been a few years since the game came out .
its not just the sound that can set weapons apart its that they can function differently .
limiting the discussion to just the sound means throwing away the possibility that the guns might not be reskinned clones of each other with very mild tweaks to their stats .
i 'm imagining something like one of those playdoh toys that extrudes the playdoh into long cylinder but like a pickle that just wo n't stop .
from what i remember from a play through where i used spells and stealth enemies can only hear your spells if you 're casting them like right next to them .
or at least that worked for invisibility and speed boosting spells .
i 'm not sure if destruction is the same or if skills affect that .
the spell i mentioned is just something you 'd use to handle repairs and probably not something you 'd do while sneaking around enemies .
i just figure since you 're going for restoration that you could put it to use in a few other ways .
your character has a bunch of skills and you can fortify all of them using restoration spells .
if you want to actually make spells all it requires is gold and to have a sample of the spell you want to make .
it just takes a while to unlock the spellmaking station but once you get it it 's crazy powerful .
it felt like rian johnson could donated a few of these jokes to an snl sketch .
it actually felt like a reference to the undercover boss starkiller base sketch .
i loved that sketch and i 'm fine with parodying the movie universe outside of itself but do n't pull the fucking parody into the actual movie universe .
well you can definitely break up with someone for any reason whatsoever so better luck with the next guy !
last time some jerk was doing the freemode event called hold the wheel '' and i was in my hydra and i could have easily blown his a.s but i did not i let him and in fact escorted him to his destination and later i texted him that i could have killed him and he replied with ..so what ... ''
then this other time there was another freemode event called hot property '' and this level 7 took it .
i went towards him in passive mode and got out and offered him my oppressor and as he was taking it 2 douchebags came and killed him .
so i went on my hydra and decided to kill the 2 little douchebags so the level 7 could get the hot property briefcase .
so i kept killing them the level 7 kept grabbing the brief case he kept getting killed by the douchebags etc for like 4 minutes until the event was over .
i crashed my hydra and spawned on the ground .
then a few seconds later the level 7 is driving in my direction on the other side of the road and i shot him a couple of rounds thinking it was 1 of the little douchebags but then i stop and let him go off .
then as i took my sniper rifle to scope the little douches the level 7 returned and kills me with the car .
and then i went full tryhard on that little ungrateful fck .
also i 'm looking for a mentor that i can ask for advice every now and then
please use this thread to write what you are planning to do what not to do what to eat etc ... as usual please do n't just list the things please be elaborate and at least put some effort to it .
i 've been meaning to set up an snmp server for a while now because i 'm trying to improve visibility into my network so i can better know wtf is going on .
i have come across lots of tools but never really looked too far into them as i would often get put off by something such as the user interface or how the presentation of the info was .
for example i just looked at nagios core live demo and it looks good but it 's kind of hard to look at.. maybe i 'm just an idiot though .
i just gave spicework 's network monitor a try and it looks pretty good .
i was able to easily add a bunch of servers and switches within a few minutes and already i have identified a few issues .
i 'm pretty amazed at how quick that was to get going and make sense of which is what i 've been looking for .
you have to log in with your account and then there are adds and things .
i 'm basically coming here to ask you guys if there are any good and free snmp servers that are similar to spiceworks network monitor in layout/visibility and simplicity to setup and configure .
our environment is pretty small but we still have enough devices and things that i need something to help keep my sanity .

i 'm not sure if this will get taken down or not but here goes anyway .
i am working on resmastering/remixing a collection of my older works spanning the last 10 years .
some of them are pretty outdated genres but i want to see them reborn into something new to share with the world .
i have some that i am really stuck with for ideas on how to transform or otherwise remix these songs into something more modern .
i was hoping i could find a producer or two with some time to work with me on coming up with some viable ideas for where i can take these songs .
i have no limitations on genres as these songs span a few edm genres .
as not to go full against the rules if you 're interested shoot me a pm my sc is in my tag but mostly only features a paid side project i am working on but gives you a look at my abilities .
these look like a really good batch of geobaskets leather looks pretty good shape looks great and has a nice stiff tongue .
i 've read many 30k hh books but have n't read as many 40k ones .
i 've not read a single 40k chaos book and now seeking recommendations for such .
i was worried because ive always hated seeing her cry and i didnt want her to be angry with me .
she was very concerned though and said that its a difficult road im taking and that shes gon na worry .
but she also said that as a mom she was always gon na worry anyway .
she brought up though how she has always worried about me more than my brother not because she cares about me more but ive always seemed much more sensitive .
and she said it always seems like you feel things more '' than most people .
maybe this helps explain some of that because ive been so conflicted for so long .
when i told her everything ive been going through being depressed trying to be this macho guy but hating it she was glad im doing what makes me happy and she could tell ive been happier lately .
and i could see she was really absorbing what i was saying as a i poured my heart out to her .
she said she didnt want me to wait until im 50 or 60 and go through years of living a lie .
and she was also okay with going to a therapy session with me and having my therapist answer any of her questions .
at the end she hugged me and said i 'll always be her kid and then she went to walk the dog .
i know that it was a lot all at once and she probably needs some time to process stuff some more but it means the world to me that shes okay with it .
tldr didnt get disowned and im really lucky to have a cool mom .
when i was in high school i met this girl who instantly took a liking to me .
she 'd talk to me all the time eventually confided in me about cutting/eating disorder/self-injury/parental abuse .
i myself have another personality disorder and so i instantly understood that this girl had bpd .
i kept my distance but nevertheless i enjoyed talking to her in a friendly capacity and whenever she had problems i would always listen and give my advice .
suddenly she starts talking to me again because of a mutual occasion then began to be flirty and got close really quickly .
i recognized this as the so called 'love-bombing ' phase but went ahead anyway whilst keeping some emotional distance .
we got intimate quickly i caught feelings she said she did might be a lie idk then she started giving the 'let 's take it slow let 's be friends ' thing which i 'm really okay with because i have n't invested much into the relationship at that point it had barely been a month .
then a short while later she suddenly comes back saying she 'changed her mind ' that she 'misses me ' and i 'm not really taking her seriously at this point but i just went along with it because why not .
she used to text me all the time initiating everything replied my texts instantly now she barely texts and the tone has also changed so it definitely feels like she totally lost interest but she 's feeling guilty ?
about leading me on and also wants to keep me as a 'backup ' option .
but then again i also feel like it 's a possibility that she genuinely likes me and she 's afraid because she got close too fast so she 's trying to sabotage it so that she can be the one to 'end it ' to regain control .
at this point what is the best course of action i should take ?
ideally i would like to date her but i 'm also okay with being friends but i ca n't read her because she keeps giving mixed signals .
note that she has a history of self-injury whenever she breaks up with someone and i do n't want to trigger anything like that to harm her but i understand if some things have to be done .
i 'm also a very emotionally stable person so nothing she does can really hurt me .
should i start texting her about what we are potentially making her feel pressured ?
or should i just slowly fade away if she wants she 'll come back to me ?
cheap trick behind the most devastating lie in the history of mankind
here is one of the results of a 2017 gallup poll on creationism evolution and public education
57 believe in some form of evolution ... saying man developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life .
evolution theory is the most important weapon to twist people 's minds
for 99 of the people the most important real reason for believing in it a trick that cost a few bucks 100 years ago .
even more incredible the trick has remained the same until now .
only lately with very fast computers that allow virtual reality software to perform convincingly enough have we seen some effects added to the base trick .
i wonder who will be the first redditor to find out the trick behind the most devastating lie in the history of mankind .

my excitement rushed over me as my ps4 pro was coming early and i would have it for christmas i saw as soon as it was delivered as i was constantly refreshing the tracking information .
i was confused because nobody knocked on my door so i rushed out and opened it nothing .
that was it i 'm going to all of the possible culprits .
i checked all apartments with my same in the area and could not find it .
my wife contacted ontrac and they said it was delivered to the wrong address how do you screw up that badly ?
i 'm betting they stole it or lied about it being delivered at all and amazon is making me wait 72 hours before anything can be done .
this is so incredibly frustrating for me as someone with autism gaming has been my only outlet in understanding the world around me .
i 'm so frustrated that people can care so little about the packages they 're carrying .
this one package took my day and absolutely ruined it leaving me in tears and beyond stressed .
i now do n't even know if i 'll be able to get the console by christmas all because someone showed such disregard for their job .
i just need to vent i spent over an hour and a half with amazon and do n't feel any better .
just figured i 'd share my frustration with what i assume are some of the few people who would understand the importance behind gaming maybe someone could relate .
so i 'm thinking about kitbashing a glade lord on a forest dragon but i 'm not sure what base size is good since it does n't have a model .
would it be kosher to use a base size similar to like alarielle ?
since i 'm seeing some posts wondering why there is so much hate for the last jedi here 's some more detail as to why i hated the movie .
it is n't about neckbeard rage or insisting on seeing my headcanon on screen or anything like that .
tlj is a deeply flawed film that goes well beyond any preconceptions or assumptions .
there are legitimate objective and subjective reasons for not liking this movie .
i 'm not trying to convince anyone of my position here but all of the what the hell is wrong with you guys ? ''
this is stupid long but downvote me to hell if you want without reading i just enjoyed venting in one post .
it 's a complete misreading of his character imo .
the guy who redeemed darth vader after he 'd murdered billions would just throw everything away after his nephew threw a temper tantrum and killed a dozen or whatever padawans ?
luke coming back at the very last moment and saving a dozen people or whatever meant nothing after his cowardly running away and sitting on the sidelines cost billions of lives .
hundreds or thousands were killed in tlj while he sat around slurping milk and making dumb quips with rey .
even worse it looks like luke is going to survive and be a big part of ix so we can see his real redemption and maybe then a sacrifice that would be worthwhile .
that to me is probably the single biggest reason people hate this fucking movie .
having luke die there cut the heart out of a lot of people myself included and it meant that his character arc ended you 're kidding yourself if you think luke is getting more than a cameo in ix he 'll get a brief appearance like yoda in tlj then probably a group ghost scene at the end while he was still tucked away on an island having done virtually nothing but hide while the first order conquered the galaxy .
it 's a deeply shitty way to send off a legendary character and he could 've been dealt with better than this without turning him into some omnipotent jedi god .
rey is n't nearly as interesting as she is in tfa .
daisy ridley is n't given much to work with here .
she just gets to play earnest and confused on ahch-to .
luke does n't really train her at all not even as much as yoda with him in esb .
i know there 's some canon stuff floating around about time not passing the same on these force planets like with dagobah .
but in tlj this was n't referenced at all .
it seemed like she was on the planet a day or so despite the sun going down a few times .
one day kylo is a monster who 's just killed his father .
the next rey has force chatted with him realizes he 's actually kinda cool and must be saved .
after what she 's just experienced with kylo oh and let 's not forget his attempt to mind-rape her rey almost immediately changes her mind and wants to save him .
rey leaves tlj the same as she came in .
a jedi wannabe who has great untapped power and potential .
i 'm as confused as finn in tfa and have no clue how it 's supposed to work .
i know people are assuming that this will be cleared up in ix .
luke 's explanation did n't go nearly far enough to explain what we 're looking at now which is a very different interpretation of the force balance etc .
more time spent here with luke and rey would 've helped a lot to humanize the movie build a relationship between them and show the depth of luke 's frustration with the jedi .
and that stuff with the kids on canto meaning what ?
a meta look at how even kids in star wars are star wars fans ?
because the first point is trite and the second is no fucking shit '' because we 've already seen this in the pt .
not bothering to really deal with any of the mysteries played up in tfa .
snoke 's some dark sider who was manipulating kylo all along known to both luke and leia .
all of the rey mystery and tease is wrapped up in a quick conversation with kylo confirming she 's a nobody .
hell we do n't even get a fucking explanation of the kylo ren name itself which is something that rey should have asked him during one of their force chats seeing as she 's basically just found out the guy 's real name is ben solo .
tfa set a lot of things in motion and then tlj just ignored them or actively worked against them .
this is n't being different and wild it 's just shitty filmmaking that shows no respect for the audience .
hell i can make a sequel to the matrix with hardcore porn and sentient toasters taking over the planet .
i know some are calling this part of the different new vibe that johnson brought to staid old star wars but was n't this stuff really just bringing in-vogue marvel movie meta-humour to another disney franchise ?
and it was wildly out of place much of the time .
the scene with luke and yoda was ridiculous too .
yet it takes a jokey talk with yoda and a rap on the head to snap back to sense ?
why could n't the fo use fighters to attack and wipe out the resistance ships again ?
how the hell did this chase just happen to lead to crait ?
and explain to me how the fo would n't have picked up dozens of small vessels leaving the raddus ?
finn and rose could 've been removed from the movie entirely .
they also got arrested by security for illegally parking their ship on the beach .
ultra secret mission to save the entire resistance and they blow it by parking in a tow-away zone ?
just to show that in the st scoundrels do n't have hearts of gold unlike han in the ot ?
if so it was still a waste spectacularly coincidental that he happened to be in that cell and i did n't get how or why this guy would 've betrayed finn and rose .
or why the fo would n't have just killed/tortured them all .
there 's nothing in the fo 's makeup that indicates they 'd pay anybody off for anything .
even if you buy into the surprise way he was killed as something edgy and different his death turns the character into nothing but a plot device to set up kylo as the big bad .
it was a shocking scene but it also removed one of the most interesting and mysterious characters from the movie and a way that the st could have been tied back into the pt and ot .
i 'm not saying the guy had to be plagueis or anything .
even setting him up as some senator a survivor of the napkin bombing etc. would 've been better than this .
also him dying in the midst of raving about how powerful and all-knowing he was was simply ridiculous .
killed offscreen along with a bunch of other people .
what was the point of her there when having poe go with finn would 've made more sense .
turned into comic relief like some kind of monty python caricature of a soldier .
shows up for a couple of minutes out of nowhere then gets presumably killed by finn in one of the most anti-climactic fights in sw history .
yeah it looked cool even if it felt nothing like sw because it so thoroughly ripped off the bsg silence space shtick .
but does n't this create massive problems for sw overall ?
i mean i 'd always assumed ships could n't go to lightspeed accurately enough to target ships even huge ones .
because if so why did n't the rebels do this to the death star at scarif or yavin ?
i love a bit of air-saxophone after some cold beers .
last year 's christmas my brother and i spent the holiday in the house without any party or holiday food .
my brother was playing with his computer whole day while i was watching the grinch '' on tv and eating cereals .
my parents went out and we could n't reach them .
but not this christmas it has lately been a gloomy and rainy week i hope it wo n't last long .
so my brother and i are planning to cook some pancakes and fried chicken on christmas .
i have no idea what my parents are planning i 'm not even sure if they care about celebrating but i hope they 'll buy a cake i 'll try asking them later nbsp
my parents are going to buy a chocolate cake yaay
i got stuck on the tower trying to snipe people .
i think i was swimming/falling not sure which it is tho .
can trade crates for other crates like santa or velocity .
i play in a rather juicer game in my area and we have one guy who is absolutely terrible .
example someone puts him all in on the river and he tanks for 2-3 minutes and finally folds .
when he folds he shows his cards and says i missed he had the nut flush draw that bricked with no pair .
he obviously was n't calling and maybe wanted to act like he had a big decision .
i want to tell him to not do shit like that because he literally tanks 4-5 times per night and we know 2-4 are situations like this .
but we do n't want him to leave either .
side note he also folds and proclaims he had the 2nd nuts but we must have the nuts multiple times per night when he gets caught bluffing lol .
also annoying but i can put up with it .
epic can you make battle pass gift-able so i can gift this to my friend
there is a reason why things happen and why they occur .
one phenomenon i am perplexed about is the logical explanation to bullying .
what is the logical reason why people bully others ?
i 've heard answers like the bully having insecurities about themselves but what if the bully was a beautiful smart individual .
i 've encountered bullies that really do n't seem to have any insecurities that is perceptible about them .
so i must know what logic goes behind bullying .
i have dug around a bit and have not found anything i would like .
everyone says to install this package maximus or pixel saver but i saw a post frm 7 years ago that allowed you to just edit the css .

the hellscape that was meereen receded into the horizon as the meereenese falcon fled .

red dragon was no skilled sailor but it 's century were not strangers at working a boat .
red dragon 's voice was quick and efficient and the twenty-four men started scouring the boat .
red dragon ordered it 's companions to various tasks sails navigation everything that it could think of .
additionally red dragon sent four of the fellow unsullied below to take stock of food and water supplies to see when they must make their next stop .
finally of the unsullied red dragon picks one to count their supply of wine of courage amongst the whole group to see how long their supply will last .
finally red dragon noticed the small dark-skinned girl standing at the back of the boat watching slaver 's bay and the whole life that she knew recede in nothingness .
red dragon tilted it 's head slightly a blank expression on the face .
it knew it should do something but what it had no idea .
so it stood next to elza who wraps her arms around red dragon 's waist burying her face into it 's side .
finally cautiously the unsullied rested a dark brown hand on the young girl 's head in silence and comfort .
i do n't have a korean bank account and only a prepaid number but i have my alien card .
im trying to sign up through siren24 but i ca n't even get pass the part where its asking for my name and alien card number .
maybe in 6 months i can come back to this post and remember where i was at .
this is not going to be a happy post be warned .
i 'm probably at 165 today with water weight and not in a large deficit with my daily calories right now .
i lost the weight primarily through just diet i did n't really intentionally exercise often but i walked upwards of 5 miles a day at college and my heartbeat increased during those times producing exercise .
i thought the low 160s would be my happy weight .
i 've lost the 30 pounds very slowly obviously .
i can see very very minor changes with my face but it looks the same in comparison with pictures a year ago .
my stomach is still very large along with my thighs .
i have n't noticed much change with my breasts they are still saggy and gross as they have been .
my arms still have fat my forearms still jiggle with the underneath-fat .
my doctor told me losing weight would decrease the amount of unnatural hair growth i have i 'm still stupidly hairy for a female .
i do n't know where the fat has been lost in all honesty .
i guess perhaps i was so big that there is n't much difference now .
when i tell myself i lost over 20 pounds i feel nothing .
it 's like saying i paid 1 for a pack of gum like stating a fact that means nothing .
maybe i had unrealistic expectations about it i guess i thought some magic number would mean people would want to be my friend or i would be less lonely less depressed .
i do notice my knee bones and my hip bones when laying in bed .
if i were to lay on my side with my knees pulled up and directly parallel with each other it is not comfortable .
luckily i 'm naturally a stomach sleeper but i can feel my hip bones press into the mattress .
first i immediately thought of princess and the pea i had to repeatedly check to make sure there was n't something under the sheet i was laying on haha !
i do n't notice changes with my sleep quality .
for exercise i do feel the desire to run .
but when i do run its like i have already found a good pace that feels fine with me but my body is n't ready yet .
i get too out of breath and have to stop even when my legs are fine with the pace i 've set .
so that encourages me to lose more weight because i know i can be at that potential with a lighter body .
on my current playthrough i 'm playing lone wolf fane and have sworn to the god king .
now i 'm doing the arx pipe puzzle and can not bless the blood to solve it .
my husband and i are looking away to get more privacy in our front lawn .
we were considering ordering hybrid willows to plant because they 're fast-growing .
has anyone use these before or do you have better suggestions ?
essentially our idea is to completely close off our front yard and just have a gate but we wanted to do bushes instead of a fence .
so i have my account verified and successfully added my 3d secure debit card .
as i try to buy 100€ of ltc a error shows up saying that the transaction was declined by my bank .
i already contacted my bank and they say they are n't declining anything .
i have already tried on mobile to same thing happened .
i do n't think my players would be here but a guy on a horse is a running joke in your dm 's game stop reading now .
i had planned material involving a keep that appears in the prime material every new moon a seeming murder mystery attached to it ghosts etc .
the arcane trickster sent her familiar to scope it out raven and saw that it was apparently abandoned gate open .
the weather was cold and wet as well though that was not set up to lure them to the keep .
i figured the group would be intrigued when a keep showed up where they knew one was n't before .
instead they decided such a keep had to be bad juju and took a wide berth to bypass it entirely .
i keep standby encounters i play on roll20 so i have to preplan even random encounters in case things need to be made interesting .
the campaign story includes a monstrous army forming in league with a bbeg to be faced down the road so i had already set up an encounter in which local soldiers were slaughtered by a goblinoid war band .
i had a successful perception check pick up a trail of smoke into the night sky from a large campfire .
the arcane trickster sent her familiar to scope it out which gave the party the advantage of knowing roughly what they were facing that friendly soldiers had been killed by these creatures and it looked like a war band so the kingdom itself is threatened .
party did n't want trouble so kept traveling to the capital city .
they did a little roleplay conversing and did some shopping the next day and the session ended .
they did n't even warn anyone that a goblinoid war band was in the area .
my keep wo n't return until the next new moon now so that 's on the back burner .
i 'm good with that but disappointed that the party went so far out of their way to avoid danger which is inherent to adventuring i thought ?
i 'm pretty sure i detected boredom from the players but the whole time i 'm thinking there 's a reason you 're bored you flat avoided any excitement ! .
i do n't railroad so the group is free to just not interact with things but i 'm concerned this will be a pattern .
so my questions for the dear fellow dms of the academy are
have you had this issue players avoiding danger to the point that nothing happens ?
what suggestions would you make for how to reflect the mistake of allowing a goblinoid war band to continue their march ?
obviously the city can come under attack but it 's a war band not a full army so that 's not a reasonable for the goblinoids approach but i feel there need to be consequences for the pcs ' inaction .
i read a story once where a wizard would physically pull breasts out of a man and push in his penis to a vigiana .
i was hoping has anyone read a story of a similar nature or artwork in keeping with this idea ?
mods engraved chapter ring domed sapphire crystal with blue ar coating yobokies sunburst blue kanji dial yobokies hands dagaz porthole caseback strapcode super jubilee smooth bezel installed engraved bezel included
price was not well received at 250 let 's try 215 to get this watch onto a new wrist
watch condition watch has been significantly modified case has normal general wear of micro scratching and swirls porthole case back has a scratch as shown in pic .
smooth bezel is brand new engraved bezel that comes uninstalled shows some wear .
what 's included strapcode jubilee bracelet with extra links seiko box possibly not original to this watch .
i acquired this skx with most of the mods listed .
i found that the custom engraved bezel did n't fit as snug as i cared for and a stock skx bezel gasket did not fit it well and it had a bit of wear so i decided to replace it with a smooth bezel .
the watch had nice mods but needed a bit of cleanup i removed the movement cleaned and reseated the sapphire cleaned the watch face and adjusted the movement to bring it within seiko specs .
i have a few modified skx 's and i 'm thinning the herd to get some room in my watch case and to raise funds for a grail .
i have a notoriously hard professor for contracts someone that literally wrote the casebook hornbook and supplement .
we have true/false that require a one sentence explanation of why it 's true or false multiple choice and essay questions .
i 've been super unmotivated to study and i feel like i 'm literally drowning because my professor crammed two semesters worth of contracts into one semester ... he did n't abbreviate the course after it was switched from a two semester course to a one semester course .
what should i do to use today most productively ?
i have my outline i 've done one practice exam essay i 've done a decent number of true/false and mc questions and i 've gone over stuff with my study group .
there are still a bunch of mc/true/false i can do and two old practice tests .
i just feel like everyone is studying more than i am and that i 'll sink to the bottom of the curve because of it .
any advice for how to use today most productively is welcome !
so my lady and i want to take a weekend trip to colorado .
can i get some good suggestions on where to stay where exactly we should be on this weekend of red eyes and munchies !
i am 24 year old guy from rural india .
because of mental health issues i did n't get to develop as my peers did .
there are no places like toastmasters clubs near where i live .
and no other places where i can learn public speaking .
there is university of washington mooc on public speaking on coursera .
but did n't because of anxiety and i am not as good in english .
when i am talking with people i am not as close with my voice gets stuck in .
sometimes i get confused or freeze up for a short period .
even when the situation is not as high stakes .
it is like my ability to speak has become rusty .
how do i improve my communication skills without proper guidance from a professional ?
because there is no one near where i live who can guide me without judging or ridiculing my efforts .
a long time ago in a desperate search to find other guardians to play with i joined a facebook group dedicated towards destiny .
the group in question is currently in excess of over 63,000 members .
over time i gained a very strong understanding of the types of gamers/consumers these other members were and despite the vastly superior numbers that they have over the hardcore/competitive community these casual gamers can actually be relatively hard to find you certainly wo n't find many of them here on reddit either .
just until recently as i glanced over my facebook feed i came across one of the group 's member posts .
the individual at hand claimed he spent upwards of 200usd to obtain one of d2 's exotic ornaments he was actively seeking for and he was n't lying .
further to my shock a fairly large amount of responses came forth only they were all commenting on how much they themselves spent on d2 's microtransactions .
i was in disbelief when i visit places like this very subreddit i see nothing but contempt and anger towards microtransactions as a whole within the video-game industry and i think it 's fair to say that there has been a strong push back as of recently in the fight against the business practice .
even governments and gambling commissions around the world have began to investigate the situation thanks battlefront 2 ! .
and from what i 've gathered i am also willing to believe that the general consensus of people here do not support microtransactions either .
these casual gamers i 'm talking about or 'hobbyists ' as bungie likes to call them are the people responsible for microtransactions taking a predominant role in the triple-a gaming industry .
they 're fully willing to spend excessive amounts of their cash to obtain items in d2 through the eververse trading company .
these are the very same consumers that gaming publishers are actively seeking to attract to their games because they know there 's almost guaranteed profit from them .
before destiny 2 released during development we were told the game would be more streamlined more casual than destiny 1 .
bungie claimed it 'd make it easier to get into and be more enjoyable for us all .
no i think the real and honest truth is that bungie were intentionally driving destiny 2 towards an overly-simplified casual route for that very same revenue i just mentioned .
the hardcore gamers were n't the target here and it 's arguable that returning d1 players were n't either .
destiny 2 was designed to mainly cater to the casual audience the source of highest potential revenue .
the destiny 2 community is split into two major groups the hardcore and the casuals .
everyone complaining about d2 's shortcomings its lack of innovation and the countless issues with the game as a whole are not bungie 's priority .
the people actively making them the largest amount of possible revenue are the silent but sizable casual audience .
we 're all looking for a game that 's not there because d2 was never created with us in mind and that 's the hard truth .
i personally believe that activision 's influence over the destiny franchise is to blame here .
we 've already seen proof of this when marty o'donnell was forcibly removed from the studio because he did n't agree with the creative direction activision were making bungie take .
the publisher makes billions of dollars annually from microtransactions in their other licensed games call of duty overwatch etc .
with all that said i 'm cautiously optimistic that bungie will make the necessary corrections to d2 so that the hardcore audience will once again find it a game worth playing .
tl dr destiny 2 was not made with the hardcore gaming audience in mind it was purposefully over-simplified for the sizable casual audience who are willing to spend more money on micro-transactions than the rest of us .
reprogramming a bbs02 with a usb cable pc attachment sounds daunting .
is there a such thing as an led unit on the handlebars that one can program on the fly so to speak ?
hey all so the mining i 've done over the years with just cpu power and a little bit on a gtx 660 has actually turned into something now i have about 1,070 cad that i could sell and a similar amount in gridcoin if i could trade and sell that .
now i wish i had been able to buy bitcoin back in the day but i had no job and no money whatsoever when it was still a decent price so my dreams of getting rich will likely never come through but i would like to make a bit more .
now electricity is n't super cheap here but i 'm hoping a mining rig could fit on my power bill without too much hassle we are at 13.74 cents per kwh
so i have a couple options cash out the bit i 've made and call it game over for bitcoin or cash out part/all and buy a gpu to put in the core i3 shuttle machine i have to dedicate to mining my 660 only nets about 50 cents a day and that was through nicehash but open to using ubuntu or something if there 's a more efficient way to mine .
unfortunately i do n't have a computer with multiple gpu slots for multi card mining but the gtx 1060 is a reasonably priced card i 'm just not sure how it is for mining and i 'd probably have to rig up a janky second power supply thinking about it now lol but it should work .
i 'm just wondering if we are past the days of buying an gpu and paying it off in a reasonable amount of time and if so what i should pick in terms of bang for buck i know the 480 was pretty popular not sure how the nvidia cards are doing .
if i had the cash i would love to set up stupid powerful rig and maybe actually make a decent amount but i do n't have thousands to toss all at once even if i cashed out grc and btc i 'd only have 2k
edit for 400 and tax i could get an msi 1060 that goes up to 1,784mhz boost which seems pretty good been a while since i bothered to shop gpu 's but that 's a fair bit higher than an rx580 .
might be able to get a cheaper deal on newegg come christmas .
currently i have put all the algos supported by miningpoolhub in my mpm script let the pool decide what to mine .
but sometimes the mpm starts mining low profitability coins/algos as well .
not sure if that 's pool flaw or miner flaw .
in your opinion is it better to have all the pool supported algos in script or only those few algos that run good on the gpu in my case i am running on gtx 1080 ?
i 've frequented this sub for awhile now but this is my first post on here so help me out if i format this wrong .
i am wanting to sell or trade my ultratech law enforcement officer edition .
this is a fantastic knife but has been carried .
there are scratches on the clip but the blade is still sharp and has n't cut much .
asking 220 obo or looking to trade for a benchmade crooked river with some extra on top .
okay so i know i do n't have unattractive qualities i 'm average-looking i have my own passions i 'm moderately confident as much as anyone i can hold a conversation and i do interesting things .
i do n't know what i should do to show attraction .
i 'm oblivious af compounded with not knowing what to do .
i know why i want a relationship that 's more than friends .
everyone has said i should have no trouble getting a girlfriend but i 've failed every single time i 've tried .
most people can at least hook up or if they try they can find a relationship but i 'm in college the easiest place to meet people and find someone but yet i 'm perpetually single and have had zero romantic interactions .
yes i also work on myself and try to be the best version of myself but i 'm starting to believe there are some people who are just not meant to share their life with another .
... i beat the game and near the ending of the credits i saw this https imgur.com/a/ykcwt anyone care to elaborate ?
this happened over a year ago but i recently discovered this sub .
so i had gotten a facebook message from a manager i used to have .
he was a nice guy so i texted his phone number he gave me to catch up .
he asked if i was interested in a job opportunity and i said sure .
we arranged to meet at my place to talk .
after having to put off meeting and not setting a specific day or time to reschedule aside from him suggesting a different day i thought about it and realized what he was offering really sounded like a pyramid scheme .
i figured i would tell him i was n't interested after all and then fell asleep and thought nothing of it .
a couple days later i saw that he had messaged me a couple times and called me while i was sleeping .
he had apparently just shown up to my house despite not having a plan to actually meet that day !
i was freaked the hell out and surprised that he would actually show up unannounced like that .
since i was sleeping i had no idea that he was even there .
but i 'm just wondering what his plan was .
assume that i would be too much of a pushover to say no ?
he never seemed like that type of pushy but i guess mlm schemes can do that to a person .
i do n't have the texts from my old phone but i do have the brief facebook conversation here https imgur.com/wlpub3b .
will we be able to buy stuff in the collections we do n't get after the event is over ?
or is it gone for good after that day ?
i 've been running a campaign for a couple of months and one player 's character is a gnome vengeance paladin wearing batman themed armor .
his backstory is that a vampire ravaged his village killed his wife and everyone else .
a paladin order saved him and took him in to get revenge .
cut to now he has willingly turned into a vampire working with a devil in charge of a demon city and a clan of lycanthrope tribes and last thing he did in session was cuddle with the daughter of the vampire he 's been after .
i 've played alliance for my whole seven years of playing .
what is the best server to play horde on ?
so i saw a fan theory about back to the future and was curious if there was a podcast where the authors discussed any alternate ideas about a movie or comic not already explained in the source .
the one for bttf was the original timeline being fractured from the first time travel .
i realize that this may be addressed by having ever seen the flash from dc comics but this was a new one for me .
he handed me a folded up 5 pointed to the car and said the wrong name trying to claim the car .
i knew who the owner is and the dude is extremely underdressed .
i 'm still on edge about buying this game .
i just want to know is ea actually going to fix the progression system or leave it .
i have mixed feelings about themes and the current state of the game .
i did n't spam anything and for the most part that was okay .
it was n't always optimal but you could put two units with some overlapping functionality into a list and make it work .
now i sort of feel like i ca n't play competitively at all and it feels really unfair .
because i have just one of many different units i ca n't play any theme forces optimally .
because of new sr rules a quirky solo-heavy list like denny 's 11 is less effective .
i like the motivation behind theme forces in principle but i feel cranky that there does n't seem to be one decent list in 700 worth of models .
we are still trying to find the owner by posting his photos online .
i might bring him to the vet/call animal control tomorrow .
i am curious about the collar '' he 's wearing because it 's not really a collar more like a plastic band .
if anyone knows where these are usually found might give me a clue of where he came from .
i tried buying a sweater 2 days ago for 50 but got an email saying it was unavailable the next day .
so now i 'm trying to buy a pair of boots for 160 instead as a gift and i got charged that amount which includes shipping and tax but right underneath i got charged another 35 .
guys i 've started using phenibut little bit over a month ago .
i 've been taking barely half gram a day and having a day off after every usage 2 days off once in a while .
just once i took it 2 times in a day and also more than a gram once .
so i dont think i 've been abusing it but since last week i ca n't sleep more than 2 hours on my off days and waking up with horrible depressed feeling it goes away in 15 minutes but its really overwhelming .
i dont think something else causes its because i never had a insomnia in my life except one time it was a short term i quit smoking weed i dont use anything but phenibut now and having this issue.so im pretty sure its withdrawal because im sleeping well in the day that im taking it .
what am i doing wrong am i abusing it ?
so there are a few things i 've deduced from this
there is most likely going to be an antisepticeye video this christmas or he 'll be a reoccurring guest '' in other streams .
it 's not only hilarious that he shows up during the holiday that is the exact opposite of him but it also still plays into his character being very unpredictable .
and they are a whole bunch of creepy things .
some are human some are not and most of them are visible .
and they all seem to have the same glitchy nature .
first up is this creepy ass lass who is definitely not the girl from the ring .
it seems like she was able to turn the lights on and off with no movement .
https imgur.com/mzo5ak3 i 've named this disciple of anti umbra short for umbrapuellae which means shadow girl in latin from the way that she comes out of the shadows .
next up is actually a squad of humans '' wearing animal masks .
relating to my theory about anti being an alternate version of jack from another dimension i believe that these people are some of the same people like antisepticeye only less powerful .
https imgur.com/nizkdmn the masks that they wear appear to be a racoon a horse a unicorn and an owl mask .
this may seem like a bit of a stretch but the animals in this mask could actually be showing antisepticeye 's story and character traits .
for example unicorns can often symbolize innocence and purity .
i theorize that the unicorn represents another version of jacksepticeye before he was corrupted '' and became anti .
horses can symbolize freedom and i think that this relates to anti 's freedom '' from what jack wants .
anti claims there are no strings on me '' and when he is in control jack is completely helpless to stop him .
so i think this shows anti 's freedom '' and jack 's lack of it .
owls can symbolize mystery wisdom and the night because of their correlation with the nighttime their behavior and the goddess of wisdom athena .
i believe this is anti 's narcissism shining through .
he believes himself to be wise and if he 's actually absorbed the experiences and knowledge of jack and his other egos '' then it would make sense .
plus he constantly outwits and erratically evades detection until he wants to be seen .
anti also views himself as mysterious if the owl symbolism can be interpreted that way for some of these other reasons but also because despite all of the times he 's appeared we still no almost nothing about him .
well anti loves darkness and shadows as do his followers it seems .
and since he 's viewed as the evil '' version of jacksepticeye it makes sense he may be viewed synonymous with the night .
as for the racoon well i have no idea what they can symbolize .
i 'm not going to give you some weird spirit animal crap but perhaps since racoons are resourceful occasionally nasty and tricky anti views himself as possessing those same traits again playing into his narcissism .
this whole animal symbolism thing is a bit of a stretch anyhow so let 's move on .
another interesting thing about the acolytes as i 'll call them is that they know they are being watched .
they look into the camera and then like umbra and anti are able to do glitch '' the feed and then disappear .
one of the more eerie followers of antisepticeye is this reverse-scuttling fellow appearing to be dressed '' in a full body suit .
https imgur.com/a/9lvpk i 've called him the backscuttler '' and he seems to have the same glitchy abilities as umbra anti and the acolytes .
i have absolutely no idea what they could represent .
some of them just are n't seen but are still trashing the building in the footage .
ultimately i think this footage just shows that anti wants jack to know that he is still around but instead of coming himself even though a surgical cut '' on ethan 's decapitated teddy bear present is implied to have been done by antisepticeye he sent his followers to mess around killing some people and defacing others while occasionally playing clips of anti in other rooms .

hey there i 'm looking to help train my nephew to be a virtuoso .
he is only 2 years old right now and i 'm curious if anyone knows of good ipad apps to teach kids how to identify pitches .
maybe something that plays a pitch and then the child has to reproduce with an onscreen keyboard ?

i have 55408 full sets from 625 different games ready to be crafted !
sorry about the bad verification as the camera flipped the writing .. please give me an honest opinion and ways in which i can improve https imgur.com/gallery/aqeut .
it 's the only security system i 've seen so far that offers some of the unique features to abode such as native geolocation support and being able to see what caused your motion sensor to go off although they use a really low resolution video .
there 's also some other features i 'm a fan of like the built in voice control support with plans to expand beyond alexa built in camera to the base station built in audio detector on the base station for things like fire alarms and facial recognition .
anyways definitely something to keep an eye on as this diy home security industry continues to grow and innovate .
i 'm wondering if abode has any plans to release an upgraded hub at some point .
i 've settled on a fit to replace my trusty old 2000 toyota and am really struggling to decide between a new 2018 ex in orange fury and a cpo 2015 ex with 17k miles on it for about 4k less in boring silver
anything is going to be an upgrade from what i 'm currently driving think no a/c or power steering but i sort of feel like i deserve something fun at this point in my life .
i ca n't justify 65 more a month in car payments just to have an orange car but if there were really any meaningful differences between a cpo 2015 and new 2018 i could swing it .
other than the volume knob is there any reason to go new over cpo on a fit ?
i was on my sloop headed towards an island for a buried treasure chest when suddenly a ship appeared on the horizon .
it must have noticed me because it began heading in my direction .
they began approaching in their large galleon and i thought maybe they 're friendly so i hoisted my sails to let them know i was n't going to fight them leaving myself generally defenseless .
well they had a more dastard plan in mind .
they began to open fire at my little ship .
sometimes it helps to be so small because most of their shots missed .
i quickly unfurled my sails and angled them for the breeze i had to get moving before i could repair anything or else they would surely have boarded killed me and scuttled my ship .
i had been trusting enough to raise my sails in a show of good faith but not so trusting as to lower anchor some things are just too foolish .
once moving i scrabbled below deck to repair the damaged hull wading through waste-deep water .
i returned above to find another player had boarded me while i was beneath .
they were busy steering my ship when i came at them with cutlass in hand .
we clashed for a bit but i sent them to the ship of the damned where all scurvy sea dogs go .
with the brigand out of the way and control restored i focused on getting my ship in a position to return fire .
i had n't realized at this point that a sloop versus a galleon is a terrible battle idea .
nevertheless we sailed for a ways before we started the dance of the circling ships .
the ship that could better handle their steering and sail angle had the crow 's nest advantage in this fight .
i unleashed a volley of cannonballs at their ship ... missing pretty much every one it 's so hard to hit them when they 're moving ! .
but it was okay because they did the same .
after circling around a few times i realized that this was going nowhere they probably had way more ammunition than me and i was running low on planks and would n't be able to board up much more damage .
so as any smart sloop would do and should have done in the first place i fled .
but i intended to give them the chase of their lives !
we sailed all through the day and into the night .
i turned off all the lights on my ship hoping that i 'd become more invisible than the ocean winds .
alas the moon was half full and removed my cloak of shadow .
day broke and we circled around an island i was hoping that i could lose them by doubling back but it was such a small island their crow 's nest could see me almost the entire time between some rocks and finally they had me cornered .
they had driven me to the edge of the world .
i could see on my map that there was nowhere left to go no way to speed off and lose these hell-bound thieves .
i imagine they wanted treasure but treasure i had none .
the only thing they 'd be gettin ' from me were some nice new red pants as i slit open their bellies and spilled their blood or i 'd die trying .
i wondered however what lay beyond the edge of the world .
with nowhere else to go i set my sails south hoping the pirates behind me would follow me to where no sailor had returned .
as i started to sail into the unknown the water became tinted pink and quickly turned into a blood red .
the sky became dark and gray and i knew that if i kept sailing i would n't make it far past this evil .
i then heard some clunking sounds coming from below my ship .
i turned the wheel as far left as she 'd go i needed to get out of here .
i then ran below deck and saw that it was already half full with water from holes made by who else but davy jones i actually have no idea where these new holes came from .
i think it happens when you start sailing off the map .
with my few remaining timbers i patched the holes and began slogging the water out with my bucket .
i 'd gotten most of it out when more holes exploded in the side of my hull !
my ship had full turned around and as i was passing the other crew they had fired at me and landed a couple shots .
i ran back up to the wheel straightened it out and then patched the new holes .
i scooped the rest of the water out and went to see the state of my pursuers .
they were in the process of turning but it was slow .
a galleon is not equipped for a quick turn and that 's exactly what they needed and lacked .
the redness of the waters was receding and i knew that i was approaching safety .
i glanced back again and the galleon was gone .
they too must have received holes in their ship from being in the dead red water but had n't noticed or received too many to repair either way their ship had sunk and i had escaped death by the stubble on my chin .
to the players that gave me one hell of a chase i raise my mug of grog to your persistence and wish you great adventures in the future .
thanks for giving me a great story to tell in this epic game .
hey guys i 'm a new player and i 've been playing zerg but i still do n't know when which units will be good .
i sort of just end up making drones zerglings and roaches but do n't know when to transition to bigger units .
this results in me having quite a bit of insolent resources mid to late game .
i think more than which units to build i also need to know when to transition to different units production
i 've been here 3 years as a pure pedestrian relying on the green line to cart my butt around to more exotic locations than my neighborhood .
and if you know the green line you know there 's not much to rely on .
i just bought a vintage english city bike to cart my butt around the city a little faster and maybe even lose some of that butt .
i 've been pretty happy with it so far but i 'm still walking a lot of the way because roads terrify me .
even as a pedestrian i 've had a few close calls with drivers who do n't pay attention .
i do have a driver 's license so i know that a bike is a vehicle and almost all rules that apply to cars also apply to bikes .
respect one way streets go with the flow of traffic stop at stop signs do n't ride on the sidewalk .
i 've been sticking to non-major roads with and without bike lanes and dedicated bikepaths and getting used to riding in the middle of the lane like i own the street in areas with no or poor quality bike lanes .
left turns still wig me out and i usually hit the sidewalk dismount and walk my bike instead .
i 'm still not sure where it 's appropriate to drop in or out of roads .
i figure any driveway where cars expect other vehicles to be coming out of ?
what 's a good way to plan trips to avoid major roads ?
i already have nice big reflectors on my front and rear as well as two sets of lights in case one fizzles out and of course a helmet .
mine has reflective tape and a red light on the rear .
if you either die lose your item to franklin 's demise drop it or use it fully you should still keep the items addons just as killers keep their addons .
this would also make it so people could use their firecrackers that they keep saved for the novelty .
the only downside of this i could see is potentially cloning items by giving them to a friend .
a simple solution to this could be to mark the item so that if taken out by anybody it is not kept .
the item could be visually marked too so other survivors are aware of this .
would pay well for a decent cert black slimline !
recently started playing on pc after years on console .
i 'd like to have the gun for my sal but i do n't want to waste my time farming if it 's an impossible drop .
our first testing went alright we hit most of our targets with good effectiveness but with the average results we decided to make some changes to our missile now called the archer missile
we will officially test the archer 2 and compare the results to its first version this rocket is a little heavier has a shorter range but boasts an increase in firepower with its enlarged warhead allowing us greater damage also we put a good amount of time into its guidance systems hopefully it will prove fruitful .
i have a bachelor 's degree in nursing and have worked in a couple different hospitals in various units for 9 years med-surg imc and pacu .
i 'm beyond burnt out in nursing but i feel pigeon-holed with this specific degree and do n't know what career to switch to .
i never wanted to be a nurse in the first place i just wanted to get a degree and be guaranteed a job when i finished .
i 'm grateful i can pay all my bills but this is not fulfilling .
i have no desire to be a nurse practitioner .
nursing anesthesia is 10 appealing to me but i 'd rather blow my brains out than spend the next 2-3 years at the bedside to get icu experience to qualify .
nursing management could be an option because my understanding is healthcare management is a growing field but that 's a role i could do but i do n't know if i actually want it .
my problem is i have no idea what i want but i know i hate where i 'm at .
nursing is soul-draining even when it is your dream job .
i 'm 32 female single/no family i have no debt and am willing to go back to school for another bachelor 's or a master 's but i have no idea what for .
i 've tried online quizzes and personality tests to help identify interests and strengths but nothing really sticks/stands out .
i 've had a therapist for the past 8ish months to help me identify interests and strengths and deal with my career anxiety .
it helps me cope with my day to day but has n't helped me find a new career path or sparked anything or given me any introspection .
my hobbies are generic fitness running weight lifting socializing with friends world travel— not really sure how to make any of them into a job .
does anyone have any career advice or advice on how to identify what you want/would find fulfilling ?
tldr bsn nurse with 9 years experience and crazy burnt out .
willing/able to switch to most other jobs or go to school or join military but have no idea how to identify what i would like .
how do i make a short or long term plan because i ca n't take another day in the hospital .
definitely do not want to be any kind of np .
what is in your own opinion the most overused song/songs in amvs ?

this might seem really trivial but over the last few years i 've noticed my finger joints becoming more stiff i have n't been able to cross them without having to physically move my middle finger over my index with my other hand and then i get pain when holding it crossed .
i just tried it now normally '' and i managed !
it still hurt a bit to hold it crossed but still !
i hope it 's the cbd that 's encouraged this change .

i do n't know a lot about weapons so i ca n't say too much but i thought the gadget/ability '' idea was cool.so basically he has a weapon to down people like caveira 's luison and if he or his teammates injures a player and he has a hook and he force-grabs the opponent to his spot but the attackers can see the hook so he can actually get caught while doing it.he has maximum 2 hooks per round.and he can have a secondary ability maybe like he can hook a teammate while dbno because his primary ability is not that big of a ability but it seems good
needing to hold down your finger 1-2 seconds would make it so you can only open clan quests or equipment drops intentionally .
no more accidental taps when you 're trying to save something up for later like most if not all players want to do at some point .
you do n't otherwise have to hold anywhere else in this game and when receiving equipment or clan crates you 're not in a rush for anything so there are absolutely no downsides .
bonus points if there 's a tiny charge bar that clearly suggests one needs to hold instead of tap .
i 'm surprised no tapping games that i know of have implemented this very obvious mechanic .

i 'm not sure how they compare in terms of coverage speeds and other benefits .
currently with speakout so any sort of activation fees would also apply .
first of all i believe donnie darko to be the greatest film of all of time and then there is the director 's cut .
before you watch there is more mature content in this version and it adds more realistic human interactions and dialogue .
what 's lovely about the directors cut is that it has more artful images and fantastic shots of donnie 's greatness portrayed .
the audio is more practical and higher in quality it may not mesh for a fluent watch but it is without a doubt more realistic .
what you can admire from the director 's cut is that it is a longer film and has more lore placed into it wether you consider it bad or worse for the movie it is still nice to have it .
in the original for instance the karen character serves little purpose and we got thinking what the hell '' adding even more confusion but in this version her character is explored more as well as gretchen 's .
i 'd like to repeat some things that exist in both versions exclusively because of my love for this film .
the film is not a comedy in the first place you are likely to get some laughs from this film but thats due to the perfect acting it flawlessly portrays people in 88 ' most notably the teenagers behaviors and levity .
this is a film in the earnest it 's a study of loneliness in the deepest most meaningful ways .
i 've purchased the whole ost because it is liberating and nostalgic even the music placed by richard himself is perfect i have even considered michael andrews as one of my favorite musicians solely from his work here .
one other thing i will claim is that the theatre scene is the greatest scene in all of movie history even if the director 's cut is destroyed by the change in frank 's voice some might say it is more time travel themed .
although both versions goes in many directions i believe the purpose of the film is to show the meaning of life . ''
it 's hard to say because it differs from person to person but this idea has been with me all my life and has liberated me in the greatest possible way .
the meaning is this quote ever living creature on this earth dies alone . ''
i 'd like to go more into it but what i 'd like people to realise is that our life is theoretically about being alone and that we all die alone and that to reach the highest meaning of life you need to not die alone '' and simply having someone by your side is not enough i 'm alluding to not delving more into this idea because this idea needs to be given vicariously .
hello and welcome to anyone who happens to chance upon this sub !
i created this sub out of love for rankin bass as a company and out of boredom .
i apologize for the rough look of the sub at this time i 've never been a mod on reddit before and i 'm still figuring it out so please be patient .
other than that please feel free to post and discuss on here i 'll probably join in myself !

was there just as much confusion anticipation and speculation to who luke 's father really was as there was for rey 's parents ?
or were people pretty convinced that luke 's father was dead like ben kenobi had told him .
about 6 months ago i purchased a zebralight h600 and some 18650 's to power it .
the flashlight has worked great for the last half year but a few days ago it began having greatly reduced light output .
it cycles through low and into medium brightness mode but will not cycle into the bright mode .
i have tried all of my 18650 's and also made sure they were fully charged nitecore d4 charger but the light still just is n't as bright as it was last week .
if anyone has any ideas of what is wrong or how to fix it i 'd appreciated it .
i listened to the audio book and was stormin floored !
the bit dalinar wrote in his memoir in the last chapter really resonated with me on a personal level .
as you can figure out from the title i am a heavy procrastinator but i wanted to extend my sincerest thanks and deepest appreciation to a flight attendant on the said flight .
i recently had some bad experience with flying and now i started to really fear flying and during this flight i was really scared and basically shaking since there was some turbulence .
i tried to stay calm but i could n't and there was this lovely flight attendant that did a lot to calm me down and even mid turbulence she stood up to tell me that the turbulence will only last for 1 minute longer and it was nothing to worry about .
when we landed she also asked if i wanted to meet the pilots and see how advanced the cockpit is and how everything is safe .
i was really all sweat from fear and anxiety and she showed me the cockpit and to my stupidity i said this makes it more terrifying '' she laughed and said this was a really normal flight and said should just ask the flight attendants next time i feel afraid ...
anyways it is 2:22am now so maybe i am not making any sense i just really really wanted to extend my thanks to her she was so sweet and lovely and wish her all the best .
thank you for reading and even though i know she wo n't read this i still want to extend my thanks .
so no one can have fun this is also the wraith buff btw
who is she and has she done anything naked ?
no you 're wrong luke should have solo 'd lol get it all those pwople using his force powers and lightsaber also leia is a space witch now which is too crazy
brown does n't know how to teach ch 101 .
although he teaches organic pretty well i would instead go to dr. petrovich if you need to retake ch 101 next semester/have to take it .
when someone posts ignorance on an original comment of mine i 'm not going to pretend i did n't notice their ignorance .
he clearly demonstrated he does n't have any comprehension of the tools and analysis that is possible for economists it 's not badgering '' anyone to simply state that fact .
and frankly that write up was written at a level that a layman could understand which i stated and if that offended '' you you really need thicker skin or to join the democrat party where you would fit right in .

she spends time guarding a remote lodge in the summer dealing with everything from badgers weasels and mink to brown bears ... in the winter we move back to town .
just wondering since you 're so experienced ... she is excellent around all people and all familiar dogs but has really been going after other dogs while out on walks in town .
i know this breed is n't really meant for life in town and is supposed to go after strange animals but what can i do to alter this ?
she used to be great with other dogs daily dog park when she was a pup but it seems like more time away from strangers made her very aggressive towards new dogs .
that 's kind of what i was thinking a photorealistic tattoo of the interview taking place

conversely the thrawn empire team i faced only one on my shard near the top was absolutely destroyed in time after two illuminated destinies and everyone still having protection on them .
the game is set up where offence is 50x better than defence which is good and all since it also allows people who use zfinn to rise to the top even if they may fall a bit further .
sadly though meta squads are still what people chase and you seldom see variety even if offence favours the player by a significant amount assume similar level of mods and gear without a huge discrepancy of course

fangraphs compared it 's value as a pitch to kershaw and darvish 's slider during the regular season it was that good .
during the ws he threw his slider just 11 of the time .
that means that they need a barrel with special grooves to work with the hop up unit .
that one is a shorter length version so your best bet is a 455mm zci 6.02mm stainless steel barrel http www.brillarmory.com/index.php ? main_page=product_info cpath=52_73 products_id=371 .
it has a second set of grooves for tm m14 hop up units the quality is pretty good and it should be the correct length .
i put one in a jg/6mmproshop ebr and it works quite nicely .
that 's fucking stupid i 'd love to see their made up bullshit 'sources ' considering damn near every one i 've seen online thats been translated from french manuals lists 170mm at 1km .

i have no evidence that joe 's wife really is that way .

it seems that a substantive proportion of voters can support an african-american or a woman .
that 's part of why there has never been an african-american female governor in the nation 's history .
i certainly would list this as a likely republican race especially given that deal is quite popular .
but i see this race as a lot like beto o'rourke 's race a challenging uphill battle in which we 've recruited a strong candidate who just might pull it off .

i know it 's a bit much but protecting my basement and press and work area from lead dust is important .
i have a sizing die set up already on the tool head .
i also might skip the decamping step and just wet tumble and dry .
the entire community 's been really divided over it .

my store 's supports do n't order my associates around anymore .
after the constant yelling at them from me and me defending my associates from management they leave my area alone and i leave their area alone .

flynn was in so fucking deep they could have put him away for the rest of his life .
he probably had 60 years worth of punishment coming his way .
he had plans to extradite an egyptian cleric seeking asylum in the us on turkeys shit list back to turkey in exchange for millions of dollars where the guy would likely be tortured and killed in jail .
this was amongst a handful of other charges i.e .
money laundering which also landed his son in legal trouble as well .
lying to the fbi was only one of the charges .
flynn flipped faster than a donald trump twitter comment and muller with great benevolence showed mercy on his pitiful sorry ass .
you know its true quit the sideshow mate trump has been in deep with russians since his 1980 's bankruptcy and he 's as corrupt as it gets .
he 's corporate greed at its finest bowing to the saudi king because he 's intimidated by the money .
you are a sheep if you cant tell he 's selling out america at any opportunity .
look how he backs net nuetrality tax cuts for the rich erasing the line between chirch and state for campaign money the fucker is getting paid to fuck us over just like every single politician and corporation ever has .
look how fucking fat he is the chump hasnt done a single hard day of work in his life doesnt know what struggle means for hard working americans like us he doesnt even live in the same reality as us .
i know youre still holding on to hope that trump is going to be the guy that fixes this country for hard working americans like us but you have to see the corporate takeover thats going on behind the scenes .
rich people dont go around helping middle class americans have a better life they swing around 50 million for fun .
they swing around millions of dollars to buy more power and influence around the world .
and you cant keep blaming barack obama and hillary for trumps failures they are gone .
seriously wake up trump is cashing in while trashing the government and our standing in the world and here you are helping him use the office of the presidency as a diguise .
the man is no president he 's a money grabbing corrupt corporate criminal .
do n't tell me you cant see it plain as day .

this is cancerous identity politics at its most pathetic .
i would say the same but his story is fairly consistent with his comment history talking about his sobriety and everything else .
plus hes done multiple game giveaways in the past .
he seems like a friendly internet dude telling a genuine life story to me .
remember the movie where michael cera plays an awkward teenager ?

in addition to the great advice in the other comments i just want to emphasize that the veggies should be in a single layer on the baking sheet and not too crowded .
if the pan is too crowded the veggies will steam cook themselves rather than roasting and becoming browned and crispy on the outside .
give them plenty of room and roast in batches if necessary .
yeah i have n't had any exposure to proxmox so i do n't know what its like to use to support or to seek support if you ca n't fix something .
i 've worked primarily with small business in an msp for the last seven years and although we would skimp on some things for a little cheaper pricing it 's just not worth going with something that does n't have the support .
a small business will generally only need one server and a couple of vm 's max licensing is minimal even on hyper-v a single license or now depending on your cpu 's and hardware you could push in a lower grade model that does the job but does n't do it as fast

i 'm expecting heavy budget constraints but if we can get a decent striker and a quality cam i 'd be somewhat happy .
of course it is possible there are many students that have taken different paths then the traditional .
if anything some adcoms view older applicants more favorably .
brown does n't require subject tests by the way https www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/what-standardized-tests-do-you-require .
i 'd be cautious of sending the math one if you are indicating that you 'll be majoring in a math area when they are n't required .
or if you 're majoring in one of the other areas of those subject tests
i assume spanish is a language you learned in school but a 500 does seem a little low but then again it could show colleges that you do know a bit of spanish depending on the level you 're at in school .
if you 're a native spanish speaker i would n't bother to submit it as it does n't give any relevant information as to your academic abilities to learn a language in school .
i remember hearing that required really means required from somewhere but do n't quote me on that .
i would be okay with finn being single at the end of the show but i do n't think it would negate his maturity if he did end up with someone .
he has n't shown signs of obsessing over relationships in quite some time .
i 'd have to see someone do it since i 've very iffy about resetting at this point lol
say what you want about the cardinals it 's pretty remarkable that they 're even 6-7 with their third option at qb and whoever 's left at rb .
because it comes off pretty clearly to me that the entire purpose of mueller was to find something like that .
i 'm not going to pretend the elite class is clean and anyone who can get elected does n't have some baggage especially someone who comes from business .
not going to let the deep state or military industrial complex if that 's what you call it pick and and choose who can be president .
i said from the start that the investigation would lead elsewhere because muh russia was just an excuse to get started .
trump has a vision and in my opinion that is a step in the right direction and america is so far off track right now that i 'm happy to do whatever i can to get back on track .

i know it 's been more than a week i was a little embarrassed by the response i was getting to my post but i really appreciated it from everyone so i wanted to respond like i should have originally if not necessarily spark the same conversation i would have had before .
i have been trying to do that more since i read your post just focus on appreciating the positive things that i 've managed recently and allow the negative stuff to just for lack of a more eloquent when to put this slip neutrally from criticism of myself into a queue labeled things you need to improve '' without so much bitterness about the screw-up itself .
i do n't really have much of substance to complain about i 've just always struggled with understanding social and emotional things and i have a long childhood history of embarrassing myself and being bullied for it for years and so i 'm always terrified of embarrassing myself publicly and tend to overthink everything that i see as a slip-up .
i get what they 're saying in that a lot of his melodies are purposefully more abrasive even when he is n't really screaming .

you can successfully avoid danger by taking proper precautions in far more dangerous places you can do it in berkeley as well .

the only reason there is a controversy around mueller is because the right wing propaganda outlets constantly say that there is a controversy surrounding mueller. if they repeat a lie often enough and loud enough then it becomes acceptable .
they know this and are taking full advantage of their brain dead audience .
they can push the narrative in any direction they want and can create any controversy they want .
their audience will of course fall for it but so will everyone else they 'll get caught up in defending the counterpoint and will unintentionally bring more attention to the garbage .

i have no problem with fresh and new but fresh and new on the 8th movie out of a 9 part series seems out of place .
it would be like if instead of getting harry potter and the deathly hollows after all the previous films we ended up with a story about some other random kid as the last two installments .
nothing inherently wrong expanding the universe but to me it just seems like a weird choice to do it at this point instead of during a new trilogy thats clearly intended to be separate from the skywalker story .
i 'm glad to see jun and haku on here .
its atk becomes equal to the current atk of the monster on the field that has the highest atk .
the monster on the field that has the highest atk is missus radiant with 1900 atk so the token will have 1900 atk .
it is also an earth monster so the token will also gain 500 atk/def .
thus the token will have 2400 atk and 500 def .
if missus radiant 's effect is no longer applied the token will have 1900 atk and 0 def .
it can be hard to tell if a road exists if there 's no recent aerial photography for example in oklahoma it 's about 3 years out of date give or take two years depending on source and where you 're looking .
i 'd err on the side existing if the change in question is newer than the aerial photography and any gpx traces along it are newer than your aerial imagery .
in this specific case just looking on whatever imagery gets pulled automatically in id it 's apparent there 's no visible trace of the highway left and can safely be removed .

sorry war zu müde um noch was zu schreiben .
der kontext ist dass er am abend vorher schon ne party gemacht hat bis um 4uhr die polizei gerufen wurde die wiederum verstärkung gerufen hat diese party dann gewaltsam aufgelöst wurde herr schneider den rest der nacht in polizeigewahrsam verbringen musste .
und was macht er als entschuldung am nächsten tag ?
ik heb mijn reactie verwijderd omdat ik bezig moet met wiskunde en toch niet afgeleid wilde worden maarja .
ik doe n t met informatica en duits ik hou van computers en talen dus ik ben blij dat ik beide heb gekozen .
heb wel een beetje spijt van mijn profielkeuze omdat ik hier af en toe echt moeite voor moet doen e m zou makkelijk zijn geweest als ik maar goed leerde denk ik .
duits is best wel kut omdat er nu veel strenger wordt gerekend ik had dit jaar een 4,7 voor mijn pta terwijl ik vorig jaar minstens een 6 zou hebben voor een toets die ik net zo goed had gemaakt .
i 'm hodling all the way and i do n't plan on spending any of it in the near future .
also just because you might not necessarily have the financial means to get invested does n't mean you ca n't do research into btc .
personally i think that it 'd be worth spending some time looking into it i believe crypto will become a very prevalent thing in the next few years looking at the exponential growth and all the media coverage recently so it would n't hurt to have some knowledge .
if you get a deeper insight into btc perhaps you might even consider it as a viable investment .
though btc 's value is at an ath at the time of writing this 19.5k professionals talk about btc 's potential to reach anything up to 40k at the end of next year .
if you 're genuinely interested and prepared to embark on a rocky ride then you could shell out a hundred dollars or so as a long-term investment .
i describe it as a rollercoaster since btc 's volatility can be jarring – especially when it dips a couple thousand though it always recovers – so it does take a certain degree of balls xd
anyways hope you got something out of that i 'm not known to be the most concise person ever .
from my preliminary test run i can say with confidence that this is a pretty strong list .
so far i went 3-0 in unranked followed by 7-2 in ranked at rank 4 and 3 .
one of the losses was caused by a positioning error in my last turn which cost me my life the turn after when i had lethal in hand for the following turn barring a ton of healing .
it plays a little bit like aggro cass which i have played a solid amount of .
edit ended the day 17-6 going from rank 4 to rank 1 i think only 2 losses were likely unavoidable this deck is pretty great
but conway works for trump and curry is an author .
it is true but i see no problem with this .
if blizz intends to make some heroes stronger campers than others they can do it with talents for example sonya already has one .
and if that is not the intended niche then it was only a side effect in the past as well .
also we are only talking about a few camps .
valla still can not effectively solo knights etc. if anything they require a hero with good self-sustain more than ever .
yeah i 'm letting my investment in amd as it is and increasing in cryptos .
so hans waver george leonidas mash jeanne and david are all good options .
i personally breeze through random class quests with herc jeanne and david .
you think the current chart is not already run up enough ?

which one of his five mansions did he write this tweet in ?
we do n't have any reliable multitone measurements yet.. still our ears are just as evolved as our eyes '' .
also.. the comparison kind of becomes moot because you ca n't wear two headphones at the same time not that our ears ca n't discern .
from practical experience i know that wipes do a great job of blocking sewer lines if there is the smallest thing to hang on to .
we all wear pom pom beanies and retro jackets .

i also want to look at a bigger picture in a next few years .
imagine if you could use it in stores and also being a globally accepted transaction .
due to no fees and instant transactions i feel like brick stores will be able to take advantage of this technology without paying the bank fees .
but we obviously need to stable the price to be able to achieve this .
if it stays as volatile as it is at the moment which i know will improve once bigger exchanges accept .
i 've just finished reading some book about pirates when i stumbled upon my first nba game 15 years ago so kidd 's last name being the name of a famous pirate was literally the reason i started to root for him and the nets .

bright dust does not fit the definition you just provided .
bright dust is a currency it is not money furthermore it 's not even a fiat currency so it does n't even represent money .
the assets property and resources owned by someone or something wealth .
the word and '' in that statement means all of those things together as a group if it said or '' it would mean each of those individual things is money .
instead that definition means that a group of things specifically assets property and resources that are owned by someone or something is money .
it does not mean that all of your assets property and resources are money but that the assets property and resources that a person owns all of it together is money .
even though you own bright dust it is n't money and is n't worth money hence it not being monies worth '' and means you ca n't dictionary or legally define destiny 2 as gambling .
this may sound like progress but this is a move from the why legalize divorce when we already have annulment '' camp .
by making annulment seem easy they build a stronger case for not having to legalize divorce .
also worth noting that a church annulment takes many years to complete while a civil one which you can run in parallel takes less than a year on the average .
this makes things easier yes but it does not address the inherent problems of annulment in general .
i 've never had a phone feel as premium as the xz premium haa in every way .

investigate a bit about charles hoskinson and you will find out .
i think it would be great if they made a longer single player experience to introduce much more content .

the yoda troll part was n't in there just for shits and giggles quite the contrary .
it was supposed to be a callback to a branch of old storytelling where the greatest power was hidden within most insignificant looking creatures .
the reason yoda seems goofy is not to make audience laugh but to throw luke off .
now can you say that the marvel humor serves a similar purpose ?
i think the relation is that they 're not the wealthiest/most succesful club no disrespect to bordeaux even though i dont particularly agree in saying your position in the table shows anything apart from how good you are as a team but i would imagine that 's the logic being used .

the player break the 4th and 5th tenets stealing cicero 's journals
regarding the 4th to be fair he fled and left them behind .
i might also be misremembering but do you have to take them ?
ca n't you just read them and leave then where you found them ?
also once the quest is over you can presumably drop them or even give them back assuming you did n't kill him ...
if you do n't then you did n't break the 5th tenant at all .
one might argue that letting him live constitutes breaking the 3rd but at that point you 're the listener so astrid is n't really your superior and so any orders '' she gives you are n't valid/binding as far as the tenants are concerned .
it has a good anime not stand-out but it runs on its very good tcg .
ok. republicans are n't even trying to hide anymore .
i 'm financial advisor myself dealing with high net worth individuals and have almost all of my clients ask me either about buying btc or my opinion on it .
and like the op i also have to walk a fine line between my personal opinion and corporate policy .
in fact i 'm getting more and more concerned about people pulling money off the more traditional '' investments like stocks and bonds in favor of crypto ...
i think he means the 'hitler ' who pumps his own gas not one who uses in in ... other ways .
check your character panel and see what grade your cp is for your level if it 's s grade you 're fine go ahead and combine .
if you are a grade or lower then level up your main weapon .
but in the end you really only need 3 different weapons blue rare red rare not on global yet and elite .
but best case scenario you would want to have every type it will just take a lot to achieve that .
so if you 're f2p that sr weapon may end up being used to limit break your future rare .
dude ... i went through a phase in my late 20 's where i felt exactly how you do ... .i drank a ton like a mickey of vodka a night for a couple of years super sad super depressed ... .however i still lived a semi normal life i worked in the service industry so drinking that much was n't frowned upon
not sure how old you are but my body just started rejecting booze ... the hangovers were bad life just felt shitty after drinking so much and i realized that it wasnt life making me so sad all the time it was drinking soo damn much ... .
so not sure how much you are drinking now but i would suggest to cut it down a bit and you will prob realize that a lot of anxiety and depression come from drinking

it 's interesting that this one is your least favorite i 'm addicted .
it 's so cool how people 's tastes are so different .
my least favorite is definitely mama 's gun i just ca n't get into it .
i just think overall htbahb is more interesting for me to listen to than zaba .
i love that album but this one just excites me more y'know ?
the best way is like the old dudes who invented it did it .
start out with c then learn about classes and inheritance .
actually if you want to really understand what the fuck is going on and are dedicated then learn x86 assembly and the sys v abi .
then you 'll understand how pure of a language c really is and how it maps directly to assembly instructions .
write some extremely simple c code like a single function to add two numbers and other stuff like that then have your compiler gcc or clang spit out the assembly and look at it .
understand what 's going on and then work your way up and youll get why the creators of the c programming language created it to help them encapsulate some things they were doing over and over .
then when you get the feel of it c is a hop skip and a jump away by just adding classes and a few syntax changes .
do everything as simple and small as possible with a simple text editor instead of an ide .
either gedit or notepad or the default windows or linux text editor .
c is a real bitch if you try to absorb everything at once and that 's even for experienced programmers .
after years of professional c development i 'm apt to just avoid object oriented programming at all costs if i can .
mainly because of how creative smart people can get with the language it makes for some wicked mind bending debugging sessions .
i laughed so hard at your comment i started coughing .
haha yap i love how his contradicts himself ... he does not get that capitalism is what takes us to the cyberpunk dystopia

you sound like the type of guy who would own a cat .
the person you 've conjured up in your head can not tangibly exist .
the person i 've conjured up '' is a 10 by now more like 20 year old boy i saw at the mechanics/junkyard several years ago while my dad was getting his car fixed .
i sat there watching this kid while my dad talked with the mechanics and friends of his .
this kid walked around more or less aimlessly drooling on himself with fairly rigid contorted arms that would twitch occasionally .
this kid had little to no idea what was going on around him .
he will never have a meaningful conversation if he can speak at all .
he 'll spend the rest of his life stuck in whatever is inside of his head .
from a societal standpoint he 's less useful than a poorly trained dog .
is it or is it not okay to treat a human being as described above like a cow or a pig ?
you 've previously established that it has something to do with us having the ability to decide the life of another creature that gives us the right to do it .
well any person who is dumber than average or better has the ability to decide the life of that boy .
now there is nothing wrong with deciding the life of a mentally inferior creature .
but there is everything wrong when the life you decide for it is a life of exploitation and suffering .
what you and your people are doing with livestock is no different than what the nazis did with people they found to be inferior .
we could round up all of the undesirables of society stick them in labor camps even chop them up into meat and really be no more evil than we are right now with what we do to other living creatures .

maybe if you change how you 're approaching encounters you might enjoy it a bit more .
using the sharshooter bow 's blast arrows can help with removing armor so you do n't waste normal arrows on taking out armor .
using the tripwire traps that you place beforehand or shoot out can help with taking out big game .
the shock arrows and ice arrows are good for stunning enemies or dealing double damage and bypassing armor respectively .
the anchor arrows are great for locking enemies down and getting a free critical or landing other status effects or getting some distance .
as for bigger groups of enemies try to avoid the larger enemies and take out watchers or lesser enemies with eye shots or other critical shots .
i would look like an idiot trying to take notes at the table and i do n't know if we 're allowed to record action .

the said msp did a tweet addressing the scots who would be paying more tax and saying that the tax changes were a message from the scottish government that ambition and hard work were rewarded by greater taxation .
the 'schooling ' to which the headline refers consists of counter-tweets either saying that many scots worked hard and were ambitious just did not earn over the new higher rate tax threshold or saying that some higher rate taxpayers were happy to pay a bit extra for the good of the community .

they should have the ability to run things as admin but should never have their account be full admin .
you never log in with root for linux systems and that applies here .
many dev machines tend to have slightly or full out of date software on their machine for testing and compatibility reasons and all it takes is one piece of malware to come down .
hell it could be fully patched and a zero day hits .
you think them having to type in creds each time they want admin interferes with timelines ?
i do use brave browser but was n't talking about that .

i had felt that the enabling '' or overstimulating '' thing that took place in this game with yuri was not realistic or at least an exaggeration .
maybe that 's because i 've never met anyone who has had behavior that erratic and maybe it actually was an exaggeration just to for the protagonist to partially see what was happening ...
i always figured cutting which i have not done was just due to depression and feelings of self-hate and self-harm .
feelings which i have rarely felt on a huge level .
could it really be enabled by being overwhelmed by feelings of lust or anxiety ?
this song is trash but at least carrie underwood is fine
i teach mo theory in gen chem but just for row 1 and 2 homonuclear diatomics .
it is simple enough and avoids getting too deep into symmetry all we do is show where the g and u symmetry labels come from and teach that only p-orbitals with the same m*_l can interact .
the only big picture message i am trying to get across is that lewis/vb is a simplified model and that there are more rigorous models out there that can explain things lewis/vb ca n't such as why o2 is paramagnetic .
i think it is a very nice example of how in science there can be multiple models with varying degrees of sophistication for a given phenomenon and that lower-level models are often 'good enough ' .
there is a numbr of thauma builds lately so i will make a list of the ones i think that are the good ones .
i do n't know if they still are the best build for farm but still really good .
wiz1-pyro1-linker2-thauma3-shadowmancer2 new build with really strong dps and a powerfull nuke against ground bosses .
maybe on par for farming materials with ff now .
the pyro 1 can be changed to another thing like wiz2 but there are not much room for choice there .
i tested pyro3 without linker but soon i discovered that shadowmancer works best with joint penality .
the strong point are not for farming materials because of the lack of joint penality but can farm them really well only a bit slower .
but warlock 3 have the best aoe dps of the 3 options with mastema and demon scratch so you can shine in other aspects of the game .
with the lift of buff restrictions thauma3 are now a valuable support for any party in the game .
there are another builds but this three are the ones worth of mention imo .
the stat allocation are usually full int/spr the amount of spr can vary but i recommend at least 80 points on spr if you are going to shadowmancer because they are really sp hungry .
thauma buffs scales better with spr swell brain so you wo n't lose barely any damage .
if there 's any corner of the internet that confuses me most it 's this sub .
thanks that 's interesting.i think ideally i would probably remove as much accessories as possible .
and you 're right it could very well be that within 5 minutes i 'm in a more relaxed state with that extra time passed .
the disphoria that a lot of trans people face is due to how they outwardly look and how society addresses them .
i have three friends that are trans and have fully transitioned .
one of them is considering doing surgery to change their genitals but the other two do not find it necessary after hormonal treatments and top surgery .
you would n't be able to distinguish any of them from cisgender people at this point .
their genitals are n't really anyone 's business but their 's and their partners .
bottom surgery like any surgery can also have complications .

he 's a wingnut though he does n't actually represent the majority .
here are the problems i have with your claims .
you had a problem with the cbo 's estimate of an estimate . ''
i do n't find this argument persuasive at all .
the cbo 's analysis has to make projections based on a number of variables that could change in the future and i have absolutely no reason to believe that their numbers are bunk .
i 'm chiefly concerned with the overall trend of net federal spending on lower income groups versus how precise the cbo 's forecasts are .
the info you 're spreading is not actually in the tax bill as the actual tax bill reduces taxes across the board .
we also need to think critically about the impact bills will have !
i believe it 's reasonable to raise flags about whether the models used by the cbo are appropriate .
however to suggest that we should focus strictly on what 's specifically in the bill without any kind of educated forecasting is flatly absurd .
just because a person 's federal tax bill goes down does n't mean they wo n't be pinched elsewhere .
what will the picture look like for these households in states with income taxes ?
how will the bill affect the cost of healthcare premiums ?
a number of variables will influence just how much tax savings these households realize .
i 'm also very concerned about the impact this bill will have on social spending .
if the tax savings in each household are offset by the need to spend more on the basics it 's a raw deal for the poor .
this kind of thing is n't going be stated in black-and-white in the bill which is why we have entities like the cbo crunch the numbers in a context .
the tax bill is being sold as a boon to the poor when it is n't .
i apologize for my harshness but please we do n't need 11 images a day from you .
i 've only ever had it as squirrel and dumplings just like chicken and dumplings .

i totally agree with the importance of a calendar .
this semester i went to school full time while having two part-time jobs .
at the beginning of the semester i drew out my weekly schedule including class time hours at work and figured out which hours i would use for studying each day .
it worked out really well for me and i did well in my classes .
i would recommend writing a daily schedule and committing to it .
it helps me to manage my due dates and it gives me a space to prioritize which assignments are most or least important .
this is the perfect time to start playing too .
yakuza 0 came out this year and is a prequel and yakuza kiwami is a remake of yakuza 1 with new mechanics etc .
it 's up there with the mgs series for me as second favorite of all time .
i 'll be honest the gameplay at times is repetitive but there are lots of optional side quests that unlock beneficial things such as new fighting styles y0 or just some extra cash if that 's your thing .

ajit pai is very articulate and sensible in his arguments against net neutrality .
here is a quote of his criticism against internet neutrality stating that the perceived threats from isps to deceive consumers degrade content or disfavor the content that they dislike are non-existent the evidence of these continuing threats ?
there is none it 's all anecdote hypothesis and hysteria .
a small isp in north carolina allegedly blocked voip calls a decade ago .
comcast capped bittorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago .
apple introduced facetime over wi-fi first cellular networks later .
examples this picayune and stale are n't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality . ''
this wiki copypasta disproves most of the echo chamber comments against ajit pai .
net neutrality is a silicon valley corporate campaign against telecommunication companies control over pricing of isp and data speed .

i love that they finally opened up about their struggles regarding authoring articles .
at least now we know that there are people who try to write/help with the movement but have n't been given platforms to do so .
they also mentioned that they were on reddit for long time and this place is good for getting to know and understand the racism becoming woke but after a while they moved on .
i notice that this is a very common situation for many woke people .
if people did n't move on and leave would it make a difference in the progress of the movement ?

the 4 non blondes were an early-90s american alternative rock band .
lead vocalist linda perry has since released solo work and produced songs on hit albums by p ! nk lisa marie presley and christina aguilera .
the band consisted of bassist christa hillhouse guitarist roger rocha drummer dawn richardson and vocalist linda perry .
the 4 non blondes had a huge hit single in 1993 with what 's up '' .
a year later dj miko remixed the track as a dance song and it became a hit again on radio and in clubs .
the original version of the song overshadowed the groups ' other work with them being labeled as a 'one hit wonder ' but they scored significant underground success particularly with listeners drawn to their feminist political themes .
in 1995 the4 non blondes contributed the song misty mountain hop '' to the encomium tribute album to led zeppelin .
the group also covered van halen 's i 'm the one '' for the popular slacker comedy 'airheads ' .
linda perry went solo in 1996 and the band disbanded after recording but not releasing their second album .

while we are at her apartment getting her things i send our very musclar black belt friend with her to the bedroom .
instead he pins me to the wall of the kitchen by the throat and threatens to beat the ever loving shit out of me .
i told him to go ahead but i was n't a coward like h. i would make sure he 'd pay for it .
week later my house was broken into and some stuff stolen .
she asked me to bring something of hers back .
i asked her if he was there because i would n't come if he was .
he told me about breaking into my house and to remember he could get in whenever he wanted .
then threatened to make me drink out of a straw for six months .
i again repeated that he would only do it once .
i also let it slip that the cops had found prints in the house and since he was on parole he might be better off leaving town .
they did n't even investigate but he did n't know that .
tldr best friend in abusive relationship helped her leave she went back he threatened me .
i sometimes wonder how much bs actually happens that does not get recorded and put online because people just do n't have the means or ca n't be bothered .
it 's been two years and multiple viewings if it was a bad film we 'd know it by now .
to take this seriously though that song has lyrics that talk about a river .

i 'm in university because my last diploma left me in an unfulfilling field of work with no long term prospects so i 'm back to get a career which you 're right is my main focus .
i 've been approaching women to make friends and have made many but i guess people just see me as only a friend .
i 'm still really happy to have friends though because i was super lonely when i moved here .
redden actually came good second half of last season .
but like the waafl http www.waafl.com.au masten is in a league of his own .

as a very long time ff fan i feel pretty much the opposite .
i do n't think xv is a bad game but i do think its a bad final fantasy game .
the plot was barely existent i cant even say its bad becasue there 's basically nothing there and the combat is really not great its just spamming whether it be spamming circle spamming square spamming magic spamming techs or spamming magic
i would n't go so far as to say i wish it didnt exist as i do think experimenting is important but i do think xv is probably one of the weakest titles in the series so much so that i was actually motivated to start developing my own game in the vein of what ff could be if they never let testuya nomura anywhere near the series ever again .

if i owned a car that cost that much i 'd park defensively '' too .
it is in the opening of the original star wars novel which came out before the movie and was totally botched in the prequels
'' aided and abetted by restless power-hungry individuals within the government and the massive organs of commerce the ambitious senator palpatine caused himself to be elected president of the republic .
he promised to reunite the disaffected among the people and to restore the remembered glory of the republic .
once secure in office he declared himself emperor shutting himself away from the populace .
soon he was controlled by the very assistants and boot-lickers he had appointed to high office and the cries of the people for justice did not reach his ears . ''
he was originally supposed to be a demagogue that assumed absolute power and became even more corrupt over time through outside influence .
return of the jedi depicts him as an all-evil master of the dark side who looks ancient .
the prequels take this a step further by insisting that he was always this maniacal dude who had this grand master plan to take over the galaxy from day one which is kind of ridiculous .
it honestly would have been much more interesting to see a politician fall to the dark side via sheer corruption than the rise of some crazy genocidal wizard .

for me it 's not that it 's not poor play by wall for not cutting it 's that okc have so much upside and their stagnant offence is excruciatingly frustrating to see one way to fix it would be motion to get open looks which is why westbrook gets criticised the way he is right now because the answer stares you in the face every time down the floor .

but there 's a tidy list of reasons why there are legitimate interests opposed to the eu
a directive closing large tax loopholes is on it 's way .
this would prevent off-shore havens a big reason why many choose to bank with the uk via jersey or whatever .
eu enforces it 's own bias in terms of imports/exports .
the above also blocks 'free trade deals ' with the us .
when ttip failed profits for things like health services or cheap meat were locked to the eu .
eu law prevents broad abuse of workers and immigrants .
a huge source of cheap labour and therefore profit .
or people that they want to wilfully deport back into war zones .
russia wants to see the eu 's plans to solidify it 's bloc fail .
russia has a lot of money to spend on this it 'd otherwise spend on it 's own military .
allying with russia against the eu is something some people see as progressive .
the eu is very inefficient when it comes to spending money .
there are plenty of situations this does n't work out well for anyone involved steel tariffs urgent changes in safety standards etc .
some people do n't want polski schleps competing with their corner shops .

i 've always seen myself as straight and have only ever been sexual with guys but often when i masturbate or sometimes in the middle of sex i find myself fantasising about girls .
the thing is 95 of the time when i 'm not super horny i pay no attention to girls .
it 's also a different kind of attraction to girls .
i 've usually got pretty vanilla tastes with guys but when i think about girls it 's always in a submissive kinky way .
i also become less interested in guys which is n't great for sex and makes me want to finish it early .
after i 've calmed down i usually feel guilty/embarrassed about my feelings and even a bit grossed out at the idea of being submissive .
i also feel really bad for being unloyal if i 'm with a guy at the time .
i 've considered trying to get with a girl but i 'm worried i 'll really regret it later .
i talked with a kinky girl in a chat room once and was super into it .
i was pretty close to web-caming her but we ended up deciding to wait until the weekend when we both had more time .
i never ended up following through as within a couple of hours after talking to her i was already relieved i did n't go through with it and the idea seemed really unappealing .
so has anyone had a similar experience or feelings ?
does anyone have any suggestions on the best way to process this ?

hey all i just wanted to get some opinions on a matter ...
i just got a 2004 v40 about two months ago .
i love the car it looks great it feels great and it 's a big upgrade from a ford focus .
but it just has n't been what i expected from volvo given their reputation .
i 've had this car for about 5,000 miles and it 's about to go in to the shop again .
since i 've had it i 've replaced the timing belt and water pump to be safe but before that an intake hose broke very shortly after getting the car .
after that i had issues with it idling very rough and stalling for several weeks and then it suddenly stopped .
and now there 's an oil leak that has to get repaired .
basically since i 've had the car it 's been in and out of the mechanic 's more than my other car ever was .
i 'm just wondering did i get a lemon or is volvo not as trusty and reliable as they 're said to be ?
my wallet can only take this for so long .
i just hate to doubt volvo because i was so excited to get this car and i love the brand .
also looking for friends to chat while being naked it would be better to show face though too
so i simply have to find the value of this expression
i turned the sec and csc into fractions and π/9 to 20° to make things easier
the 20° angle reminds me of morrie 's law '' but i do n't know what trick to apply in this case .

hello i 'm having issues with one of my p2416d dell monitors i have two .
when it is powered off but still plugged in it makes a sort of faint squealing sound .
it 's very quiet and if my pc is on i can barely hear it over my case fans but if i shut down my pc then it 's pretty obvious in my quiet room .
i tried messing with settings and swapping power cords but no dice .
i feel like i have n't noticed this before but honestly it 's so faint it could have always been there .
i just recently moved so now i wonder if it was somehow damaged in the move .
i 'm not sure how it 's possible only one monitor makes the sound and it does so while off but still plugged in

during the floor exercises last weekend i decided to use the bosu to make the upper body movements bicep curls upright rows more challenging .
i turned over the bosu ball so that the flat side was facing up and stood on the bosu while doing the exercises .
in the middle of my set the trainer came up to me and said i 'll let you keep doing that today but just want to let you know that starting in january you will no longer be able to do that because it 's dangerous/unsafe . ''
is n't that why we sign a liability waiver before class ?
imo there are exercises that are way more dangerous than standing on a bosu ball .

so we have all seen the posts today about raiders oos punishes not working properly after the patch .
after further testing i can confirm that his heavy into raiders fury punish no longer works without a wall .
however after further testing thanks u/themmeatsweats we noticed a few other things .
some of which are good some of which are bad .
1 raiders stunning tap into raiders fury punish does still work !
the input is the same the timing is different .
basically you do a back throw now done by holding down gb until reaching the proper point in the throw animation then after releasing them immediately forward dodge but delay your light attack input .
essentially do the stunning tap cancel at the end of the dodge animation .
what this does it it allows you to get the full forward movement from the dodge before cancelling it allowing you to cover greater distance .
this means the tap will land in addition to the raiders fury follow up .
2 the way raiders throw works has been changed .
some of you have probably seen the post made today showing a weird looking animation for his back throw where the enemy flys off to the right instead .
this is not a bug at least i do n't think .
the just changed the way his throw works without telling us .
before if you held back on the movement stick and briefly tapped gb you did a back throw .
if you held it down you would continue spinning them .
the way the throw works now is you hold back on the movement stick and the second you release the gb button you will release them from the throw .
if you hold it slightly they go directly to your right .
what this means is it 's much easier to aim raiders spinning throw .
before it was always tough to tell exactly when they would release from the throw and where they would end up .
which meant it was hard to land wall bangs sometimes .
now you have a fine degree of control over when you release them from the throw and where they go but it takes some getting used to .
this spinning version of the throw does not appear to throw them any further than raiders standard left or right throws where he uses the handle of the ax to push them .
3 the additional stamina drain raider got by holding down gb and spinning the opponent appears to be gone .
the stamina drain from a standard right or left throw and the full spinning back throw appears to be nearly identical .
or at least so close of it i could n't visually see the difference .
what this means is there is very little reason to use the spinning throw of your opponent is not oos .
you will no longer be able to gb a nearly oos opponent and then keep spinning them to put them oos causing them to fall after the throw .
this takes away a lot of opportunity to get off your oos punish and also hurts his parry game a bit since before you could parry an opponent putting them nearly oos then spin them to shave off the last bit of stam .
it 's seems like some of these changes may have been intended such as the better throw control but may have had unintended consequences .
if any of these changes were intended they were not mentioned in the patch notes which is not okay .
if they are unintended hopefully they are addressed soon .
i 'm trying to make a circle in a square canvas where the canvas and the circle are the same size .
i have set the canvas to 500mm x 500mm in the document preferences and then opened up the xml editor and set the radius of the circle to 250mm half the size of the canvas because that 's how a radius works but when the circle scales to that size it is somewhere around 20 larger than the canvas .
i 've tried changing units in the xml editor as well as in the document preferences but i ca n't seem to get it to work correctly .
i do n't care about the units i use as long as the proportions are correct .

hi all i have an s8 gm955u on at t and about a month ago i updated to the oreo beta 2 release zqk1 when it leaked for at t .
since then i 've had an extremely high amount of issues with my phone and have attempted multiple times to downgrade it to aqgl or bqk5 with no success .
every time i attempt to extract an update package after downloading to use with odin it says that the zip is corrupted i 've tried downloading on multiple computers on multiple networks with similar results .
if i attempt to avoid the corruption flags and pass the extracted files into odin it says that the files are not valid odin files .
at this point i 'd just like any sort of suggestion with how to save my phone from perpetually being stuck on this update !

service libraries are becoming a necessity for any msp .
not only do they provide the information you need for efficient service delivery they standardize processes making it easier for all team members to be equal parts of the noc or help desk ?
a lot of msps have told me the biggest obstacles to creating a service library is not knowing how to start or even how to collect the content they need .
if you are struggling with getting your service library off the ground what are some of your reasons why ?
if you are an msp and have a great service library what did you deal with during creation and how did you overcome any issues you 've had ?
to make sure you do n't spoil anything sensitive !

i have two friends one is a native tatar speaker and the other learns french i too did learn a little french but mostly how to read and pronounce so very bad knowledge of it and i find the sounds in both languages fairly similar to pronounce for example o '' s and r '' s. is there any connection between the two or is it just my imagination ?
this build started after my video card caught fire last weekend .
since i 'd already been wanting to build a new computer and did n't want to wait for the rma process i took it as a sign that my rig was to reborn from the ashes .
one of the things that i always appreciate with a new build is seeing the advancements in computer cases .
most notably were the two ssd casings which my ssds snapped right into without the need for screws .
the build was pretty straightforward and uneventful save for one particularly annoying moment when trying to install my video card .
there was a purely aesthetic piece of plastic with the words amp-up audio '' on it that was blocking the way for my video card to seat all the way .
i thought this was a really bizarre design choice because i had to take it off to get my video card in .
booted right on up and treated to me a lightshow no issues .
i 've never had leds in a case before and i will be including them in all future builds .
i really like the color white so i opted for all the white components i could .
in keeping with the theme i set my leds to a nice fiery orange though i guess if it combusts again i 'd be none the wiser ... the aorus components lent to the phoenix theme with their bird appliques though the one atop my video card does not appear to be working .
coming from the full-sized nzxt switch 810 to the mid-sized felt really good and i 'll never be going with a full-sized again .
the case insulates noise quite well but does seem to be kicking out notably warmer temperatures than the prior case .
not too high however according to corsair link anyway .
the one complaint i have about the case is that the cable management was a little bit tricky and i did n't want to dilly dally with it too much but i 'm fairly happy with how it turned out relative to my other build .
all in all it was a really fun and easy build and i 'm really happy that i bit the bullet and built from the ground up .
looking to add some rgb lighting strips if you helpful folk can point me to one that would be compatible with the controller that comes with the 570x .

i was never a god at these games but i had a respectable 1.8 in mw2 and waw .

my so and i are flying out of chicago 6am on new years day and then have a 6 hour layover in seattle before we head to our final destination in se alaska .
we 're scheduled to get in to seattle at around 9am and depart around 3:30pm .
certainly long enough to go into the city and a nice new years day brunch might offset the crappiness of the itinerary .
i am totally new to this bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies i know there are wallets like xapo blockchain ... each with one or multiple interfaces like web ios and android so which wallet is more secure and with better privacy ?

the dlc which i figured would expand the story started off promising and introduced some new mechanics and weapons and some really amazing catacomb gameplay but it never went anywhere really that interesting .
i found myself finishing it just to finish it .
it makes me sad because i actually liked unity a lot .
it has to be my favorite world ac has done as far as how real it feels origins is just so empty in the cities but other than that it 's pretty close race i 'm glad the unity group is making the next ac they have a chance at redemption for what i really feel is a game that had a lot of ambition but did n't hit most of it .

i made the dumb decision to get the grey one even though my hands are a bit sweaty .
so after a few months i got the dreaded yellow disclouration .
it 's not too bad but bad enough to be annoying .
so i figured i 'd ring microsoft and see if they 'd replace it not holding out too much hope .
i called them and they asked for some pics .
after sending them through they said sorry but since the typecover is still working they ca n't really give a new one just for wear and tear .
i told them i was disappointed and said i 'm a happy microsoft owner and it 's not a very good look to be promoting their premium product with a yellowed typecover but it 's up to them and fair enough .
couple of hours later i get a call from the store saying they 'd changed their mind and they want me to stay a happy customer .
and not only would they replace it but they 'd send one out before hand so i do n't have to go without a typecover .
not to be a hater on apple because i think they are a great company too but they are so stingey on the same types of issues .
my ex had an iphone that just broke the touch screen stopped working and she had to pay 500 pounds for a refurbished one because it was n't under warranty .
technically apple is not doing anything wrong but it is shit if you buy a super expensive phone and it stops working completely a couple of years later .

i find myself not feeling anything i feel like i 've kind of became self aware to the point where i 'm just a bystander to my own life like i 've started referring to myself in the third person and shit .
in the wordbook one hint for oversetting the word 'gender ' is the word 'asleye ' but i do n't think that this is the best choosing as it is a word that does not show any great meaning forthwith .
as a man with great love for speechcraft this is a word that i must brook quite oft .
instead i reckon that the onefold word 'kin ' would be best at least in speechcrafty frameworks .
the old english cynn https en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cynn seems to have been bridled to speak of 'grammatical gender ' and i think that it is a more inbuilt word that speaks far greater meaning forthwith when seen .
hence for byspell 'the kin of that nameword is manly ' would mean 'the gender of that noun is masculine ' .
are there any grounds upon which this is not either needful or maybesome ?

i 've been thinking of doing this ridiculous marathon of watching old movies from 1900 to 2014 to see how movies considered great for their time and year progressed and evolved to movies now .
that 's the turn of the century and also to have a beginning to start this marathon .
because one of my favourite movies of all time came out that year interstellar .
i know 2001 a space odyssey and citizen kane would be on the list of the marathon but i would like suggestions of which movies to watch because there are movie fanatics who love early 20th century movies and they could point me in the right direction .
note exclude the star wars saga as i prefer watching them as a complete saga
first i 'd just like to say hi to everyone and that i got my first core set as an early christmas present .
star wars is kinda our thing to do together .
now a little bit of back round in ti my limited knowledge of the game .
though i have yet to play a game i have been familiar with the rules by reading online pdfs and have followed the game on youtube and seen all the championship games from regionals to worlds since 2015 .
okay now that 's out of the way time for brass tacks i have always loved the hammerheads since i first saw them in kotr one of my favorite games and more then anything i want them in my fleet .
i 'm constructing my first fleet and making good progress .
however i am not sure how they are really supposed to be used in armada or what build lists are best for having them in the fleet .
since they are relatively new i have n't found much online about tactical review on them .
so basically though i know this is a pretty demanding question would anyone be willing to share their wisdom with some hammerhead tactics with me and show me the ropes so to say of using them to their ideal efficiency .
i would greatly appreciate it and i apologize for the lengthy message .
i do n't even like the shit lmao well least it 's not hardcore drugs
hey im a fairly new adc main and i recently played against a j4 who kept oneshotting me in teamfight .

so i just updated my iota dektop wallet to today 's version 2.5.5 .
when i logged in with my seed i noticed that i am missing 564 miota .
i know that with the previous version i could generate new addresses eventually my balance showed up however i am not seeing that functionality anymore .
i am praying that i did n't just lose it all ...
obviously i 'm not expecting my rep levels to carry over or to have an unfair advantage but will it be possible to get something for being an alpha tester ?
i think that would be very rewarding not that playing early has n't already been rewarding .
this has actually been an issue ive had since day 1 but i 've never bothered to really look into it until now so returning it definetely is n't an option .
i do n't exactly know how to explain this but when i distance my head from the screen by around 2ft waves of lines suddenly appear .
i only see it from this distance anything closer and they disappear .
they move along with my head if i move left and right .
its similar to the wavy dark and light effect you see when you turn on 3d except the problem is my 3d is completely off .
its driving me nuts and i was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there 's a fix for it as i cant find any other thread about this on the internet .
it only happens with the top screen bottom screen is totally fine .

one that is grand in scale and has a huge production budget behind it
i rarely dream about other people but in the last 4 days i have dreamed 3 times about this girl .
yesterday i dreamed that someone asked if my childhood was good to which i replied yes and then i asked to a friend of this girl if her girl i dream about childhood was good .
she said yes the girl i dream about shows up and asks why '' and i replied just curious '' .
i have never spoken to this girl nor her friend and it makes no sense that i asked that
quick background i run a web design/marketing company that primarily works with blue collar businesses i.e .
i get asked variations of this question in a little over half of my pitches .
at the tail-end of my pitch while going through pricing the potential client would rather pay per client i bring them even if that means they end up paying me significantly more than my proposal .
i appreciate the thought process these business owners have and in a perfect world would love to work off this business model but as far as i am aware i do n't think it 's possible .
it would require me to record all phone calls and follow-up on all leads the client gets from me to see if it actually turned into a job .
on top of that if the business owner says something like he heard about my business through a friend of mine .
that 's not a lead you brought me '' well i believe i 'm sol .
long story short i was wondering if anyone has success running their business in this format and if so how they track how much the business should be paying at the end of each month .
i work for security firms on a freelance basis but it has gotten to the point that they ask for me personally .
i 'm never hurting for work because i do 12 hours sometimes up to 7 days a week and i 'll work areas that a lot of guys wo n't .
abandoned buildings airstrips in the middle of nowhere deserted hospitals .
some do n't even have electricity or phone lines and that 's ok too because i run my phone and laptop from a satellite hot spot in my car .
i do n't have much of a social life really no friends to speak of no girlfriend only the web .
i roam far and wide on the internet and i 've seen some strange stuff .
i like paranormal sites conspiracy stuff ufo sites and anything else that will keep you on your toes while you 're out in the middle of nowhere guarding some old sanitarium in the middle of the night .
except this website i came across once almost by accident .
i had recently been working steadily at a private cemetery they had been moving stone by stone coffin by coffin to a larger one in order to repurpose the land for something or other .
there was a little construction shack there that had a generator and i worked out of there to set my rig up get my coffee going and charge up my flashlights .
i settle in this one night eat my chicken tenders and get the coffee going and i notice someone had scratched into the top of the plywood desk – https layers.org .
i figure its porn or cake recipes or whatever and i almost unconsciously type it in to my search engine .
as usual it 's porn and dip recipes and whatnot .
there 's one that claims to be the gateway to another reality .
so i click on it thinking its right up my alley .
in black letters on a gray background it simply says
i notice my cursor changes when i hover over them so i click on layer i .
of a pair of hands belonging to an elderly man liver spotted with white patches and yellowing nails .
the hands begin to clench and unclench while the left one begins to slowly roll over and open .
in the palm rests an old coin possibly made of gold .
the phrase i feel all that you touch appears below the now frozen video in old copperplate script .
the screen fades and returns to the layer list although layer i is now a different color and is in the oldish looking script .
layer ii a white iris slowly opens like in an old vampire movie and reveals a plain pine coffin resting on a chair at each end .
the camera moves to the edge of the coffin and hovers over the face of a deceased man in his 80 's or 90 's .
he had abnormally white hair that flowed down onto the shoulders of his ancient suit .
he had a pronounced hook nose and his skin seemed to be stretched tightly over his skull .
the camera shifted and closed in on the dead man 's wide thin mouth .
the lips twitched for a second causing me to jump and then i watched in horror as they parted tearing away from the mortician 's thread .
a scream that lasted a full five seconds blasted out of my computer 's speakers rattling me to my core .
i speak all that you hear appears below his now gaping mouth broken threads looking like tiny worms crawling out of his lips .
a part of me feels that maybe i should get away from this site but i got ta tell you it had me hooked .
layer iii opened with the same guy laying in that coffin with his mouth wide open and the camera seems to actually enter his mouth revealing the back of his throat .
there is the tiniest quiver at the back of his tongue .
his throat begins to fill with what looks like milk slowly at first then more quickly with a whirl pool motion .
the camera backs away as his mouth fills to capacity and milk begins to run down his chin and pool around his neck .
that old fashioned script appears and reads i feast on all that you taste .
i had to take a break for a minute and catch my breath .
i was n't sure i could continue but with three down and only two to go how could i stop ?
layer iv opened with that old timey iris and the camera positioned over the dead man 's chest .
strangely his shirt was still wet with milk and almost appeared translucent in places .
from the edge of the iris i saw two sets of hands resting on opposite edges of the coffin .
they reached from opposite sides to the buttons on the man 's shirt .
and they just pulled it apart tearing the fabric .
the old man 's pale flesh revealed the stitched up coroner 's y cut and something else .
one of the children pushed a document into view modern and glossy .
i only caught a glimpse before it was pulled away ... .
the victim sustained a single stab wound to the left chest in the mid axillary line just below the level of the nipple .
a pericardial tamponade is lethal unless discovered and treated quickly .
... ... ... ... to reveal the single stitched up stab wound .
the old copperplate script appeared and stated he smells ... .of whiskey ... ..of savagery ... ... .of blood.
this just was n't making sense ... gold coins and screaming tasting stuff and smells ... and i stopped .
it 's the five senses i said to myself as the home screen appeared again .
the only one left had to be ... ... ...
layer v opened with a close-up of the old man 's eyes .
they were closed at first but then they began to twitch back and forth under the lids .
even in black and white monochrome you could tell he had pale gray eyes .
they glistened and the pupils expanded and the camera moved in .
there was a dark haired woman lying on a small bed .
she was dressed in a brilliantly white night gown and had hair as dark as india ink .
and she started to thrash back and forth looking almost like it had been filmed and then shown in reverse .
her movements grew more rapid and violent until her face filled the camera and she screamed a silent scream for a full minute until she faded from view and the script appeared .
i see all that you desire and then it went back to the home screen all the layers complete and disappeared .
the sun is starting to come up and i 'm wondering where the night went .
i 'm drinking the last of my coffee and watching the foreman pull up in his pickup .
we exchange pleasantries and he starts setting up in the little office .
i 'm about ready to get out of there when he say 's
we 're just about done here got most of the residents and stones moved .
yeah some special handling for some of the larger mausoleums .
there 's one family we have to make sure we transport together. i can feel a tingling at the base of my spine starting to crawl up my back bone .
he looks at me and say 's murder victims ... .some old guy a young woman that lived with him and two little kids all in the same mausoleum.
yeah killed the whole family with a dagger of all things ... never caught the guy
so like i said i do n't have much of a social life workin ' weird hours at even weirder places .
except i could never find that site again the layers one .
tried quite a few times but i could never find it again .
but i never forgot about the woman in the white dress that old man or those little kids hands pulling open his shirt .
i 'm drinking more than i should cruising the bars .
you see when the mail came a couple weeks ago there was a package for me .
inside the box there was a little cookie tin like the kind you buy for special occasions with the two or three layers in the little paper cups .
had circus clowns on it and balloons and a man with a top hat and tails .
there was a photograph of an old man a beautiful young girl and two twin boys about five years old .
they were on a porch smiling for the camera .
inside a little envelope there was a gold coin ... it looked very old .
beautiful carved handle with a stone in the butt .
ivory spacers in a black scabbard tipped with silver .
looked on the internet and they said it was called a skein dubh from scotland .
and so i cruise the bars drinking too much although it does n't seem to affect me anymore .
i know what he wants i know what he smells like it 's almost like i can see through his eyes now .
he 'll step out of a bar some night with that self-satisfied swaggering walk and i 'll be waiting .
that bad history goes along with the rest if our bad history however .
we are a much different club now and these are the kind of teams we need to beat to reach the next level .
do you also run praetors grasp sadistic sacrement or jesters cap ?
black seems to have all the combo piece removal now that i think about it .
i do n't mind if your deck has a few combos that can be dealt with but if your deck is literally just your combo and a million tutors to get your combo together i 'm not gon na be having fun playing against you .
look up math with bad drawings patterns in the stonework .
no it 's not hitting double leaf blade less it has a 25 chance of hitting it every time he attacks if you expand it to level 5 .
that moves up to 30.4796 if you expand leaf blade to level 10 .
if he 's less than either of those two try leveling him up to see if that helps with his consistency to your satisfaction .
he is n't as good of a receiver as hopkins but he is faster and has a better qb .

being good '' at skiing is n't always easy to quantify and in my opinion it gets more ambiguous as you progress .
as a beginner skier most of the progression taking place will be around technique stance and body position turning stopping pole plants etc .
so at this stage there are pretty clear landmarks that you can use to measure your progress .
like any sport provided you have good instruction your technique will improve as you spend more time on the hill so do n't stress about it too much as the learning curve is pretty natural once you can turn and stop effectively .
as you become a more advanced skier the focus is less on technique and more on the difficulty of the terrain you can ski whether that means advancing from blue trails to black diamonds or learning to ski steeps and couloirs .
ultimately the most important part is to enjoy yourself .
skiing is a very free in spirit not in price lol sport so yes push yourself to improve but do n't get caught up in trying to quantify something unnecessarily .
in my opinion being good '' at skiing is about being confident in your own ability and provided you are happy with that you will always be a good skier .
you need to understand that all wallets are identical .
and you either have those numbers keys or you do n't .
you sent coins from one wallet you did n't have the key to to another you also did n't have the key to .
what you should have done was to go to https walletgenerator.net ? currency=dogecoin and in the bulk tab generated a bunch of wallets and saved these in a text file .
then when you sent your coins to one of those wallets you would have the key for it and be in total control and not trying to deal with a broken client .
this is because there 's another fantastic service https coinb.in settings which allows you to move coins around .
yes both sites above are downloadable and can be run mostly offline .
and then you should find the option to export your keys from md and add them to the text file .
be sure to label what each wallet is for and make copies on usb sticks and paper and stash them in safe places .
note that you should check the keys md gives you to make sure they 're not encrypted .
you can do this with https coinb.in settings by putting the key rather than the address in the source field and hitting load .
it will calculate the address and load the utxos which should match the address you expected and the number of coins you thought you had .
if the key is encrypted there are tools around to decrypt them .

after you finish warrior you have some insane burst with q aa e doing like 80 of a squishy champs hp .

i used wiley for all my other ones with ninja as a supplement on reg .
used exam matrix and wiley for audit this time .
was trending an 80 on exam matrix but i did all of wiley 's questions as well after trending at 80 on exam matrix .
i got in the 90s on my last 2 practice tests .
honestly i kinda phoned it in on my 1st attempt at aud .
my sims were rough on the real audit exam though .

people that do n't like this movie are just being contrarians .
john posted a video on this a couple days ago .
i 'd love to see this pick up steam and go forward .
honestly i do n't think she shines in joust .
a lot of the non-conquest modes you 're actually a magical warrior and should refocus your gameplay as such .
i 'd look more into a more selfish build in joust and arena looking to max cooldown and running void stone and late game switching cdr shoes to pen shoes to try and hit true damage and looking at getting as many reach aa cancels as you can to max your damage output .
since you 're in for a constant teamfight you 're likely going to be dove more than you can peel and so you 're better off being the initator especially since your ult is n't as strong for rotations since all you 're doing usually is rushing back to lane with it .
athena is strongest as an actual backline peel tank in conquest where teamfights are more careful and your peel is going to be up for most of the dives .
as well your ability to rotate across the larger map is a lot stronger which is where you shine .
and yes you got pushed out by the other team because athena and artemis are n't very good in lane .
they both struggle hard with lane pressure so if you 're going to run that duo which honestly i do n't recommend tbh you 're going to play passive and fight to stay even instead of trying to win lane .
athena pairs well with a high pressure adc so that you can force them into fights and do n't have to worry about being bodied by minions .

corrin was not proof that the concept of avatars is inherently bad they were the protagonist of a game with bad writing .
i do n't know why people do n't get this .
it 's such a bizarre thing to act like corrin is somehow separate from the story they 're written into .
the only real problem i have with an avatar in principle is all the awkwardly written supports written so that they can marry anyone and everyone .
i guess that 's just an awakefates problem in general though .
also i feel like they 're more of a customizable protagonist than an actual self-insert but that 's fine i guess .
i ca n't think of a decent third justification for them after fe4 's actual timeskip and awakening 's alternate timeline shenanigans .

you have always stood out among the crowd of developers and have always been very open with us ... but recently you 've started making excuses and flat out lying to us .
because we 're estranged from our neighbors here for various cultural and economic reasons and generally have less social support from family friends neighbors etc than other cultures .
edit example my european friends and israeli in-laws have no qualms about hugging physical contact affection if they mean it or with the younger generation talking about mental illnesses .
meanwhile here in the us it 's just weird to hug my family or friends and i 've never talked about my mental illnesses with my american friends .
we have this thing about vulnerability where we need to be strong and not need others that needing others is perceived as weak and society tends to shun people who have issues or are otherwise not part of the norm .

not judging but whomever said what.. why would they only partially reveal information about something so many people are dying for answers for .
i think a lot of the voters are expecting some sort of collapse from them while villanova looks like a more sustainably good team .
although true those arent game breaking they are issues that need attention .
shg should acknowledge this stuff and take care of it asap !
any other developer would have done this same shit wouldve been gone by now .
but because its call of duty its ok. its saddening .

this segment between elias and the women have great comedy potential .
if your game is a survival game then distance/time between obstacles is your main unit of measurement .
unless you are doing some sort of ironman survival thing where everything is truly random you want your players to be able to you know survive .
so you will probably need to spread resources in such a way that it makes the players make a choice .
your environment design should tell players at a glance what kind of choice it is .
an example would be the army bases in dayz and it 's like .
you know there is a high chance of guns but it 's also a hotspot .
the buildings if you were coming up to them for the first time would give you some kind of hint to what 's inside .
you do n't necessarily have to abstract all meaning out of gameplay objectives but you can certainly test the game that way .
where it 's literally just the gameplay effect and test spacing .
when does survival go from being fun to a slog .
can you make the unfair situation better with alternate routes ?

not everyone wants children so i 'm sure those people would n't have an issue with you keeping your family separate from your relationship .

the vote on removing the amino hub out was not his doing at the time there was a lot of distrust towards the amino hub because of your fellow ambassadors association with the vestroga hub and what occurred during the war .
the ambassadors voted on the evidence not on the word of one person i personally voted to allow the amino hub to stay .
the metahub i agree was not the best idea but again the issue was weeks ago move on .
as for the lore hova stirred up that trouble and 710 defended themselves against the accusations .
personally i do n't think the federation should be filled with lore small amounts are fine .
so to reiterate why do the two of you need to keep up this shit mind my language but all i hear is is whinging ...
i honestly think it 's leading to something scarier .
imagine all that first order tech in the hands of nobody in particular .

i do n't know if it really solved the whole thing but i changed my download region in steam to sweden if you 're in eu and found a lot of players online yesterday .
it 's the tatoo on the upper titty that just exudes trash
i did this with a pi and run node red on it to debounce and publish notifications to mqtt .
these sensors are just momentary switches powered usually by 12 to 15 volt .
the tricky part for me was that the run length to each sensor had enough voltage drop for the 5v of the pi to make it unreliable .
what i did to mitigate this was to run 12v over the line to the motion detectors into a 12v relay block that is mounted right next to the pi and switches the pis 5v easily then .
it works but those mechanical relays make a very audible click .
he sang anoche acapella and there were people in the chat telling him to stop singing and basically insulting him .

we can simulate the game of life which is turning complete with them
we can be simulated by a particle physics simulation which can be run inside a turing machine .
as for finite states '' that 's just a natural result of how neurons/axons work they have finite albeit extremely high amounts of possible connections .
it 's not really a particularly revolutionary result lots of things are turing complete .
yes just like republicans worked with democrats the last 6 years

that was all they could do and considering how big of a hit kh was it was kind of expected that everyone had played the spin-off '' .
kh3 is a bit of a special case considering how long it 's been since kh2 and how many side games '' there have been between them .
i use the term grudgingly because they 're all integral to the plot in one way or another but too many people look at them as just throwaway titles without realizing what they 're missing out on .
it 's kind of a unique situation for people coming into the series for the first time .
considering how cheap and easy it is to play/watch the entire series on one console now with 1.5 2.5 and 2.8 all on ps4 there 's really no excuse to just jump into 3 without catching up on the series but some people will .
my gut reaction is to just go oh well that 's your fault for skipping over the entire series in a plot-heavy series . ''
just open straight into the story and do n't recap anything that does n't directly tie into the opening sequence of the game .
if they have to recap something put in some big journal entries that we can skip over if we 've already played them and get right to the action .
do n't punish those of us who 've kept up with the series with a long meandering recap that we do n't need or care about but have to sit through because some knucklehead does n't know how to count .
and memes are n't supposed to be taken seriously .
humor is used to hide sincere feelings behind a shield of irony .
online memes specifically have played a huge role in politics the last few years and are used to transmit points of view quite often in a denigratory or toxic way .
memes as with all forms of communication can be taken seriously especially if they are being used to harrass and belittle vulnerable people .
people whinge about repeats but i 'd rather see porridge re-run for the fiftieth time than bullshit poverty porn and jeremy kyle .
they have tons of youtube videos and both are incredibly talented at the game .
biggest thing to keep in mind is that once you have your aim down situational awareness is king .
after that its all about experience and knowing what each enemy ship you are facing can and cant do and what their strengths and weaknesses are .

why are you assuming you need a new car to uber ?
why not spend a bit less for a reasonably priced dependable car that is still eligible for uber .
that way you can choose to drive but you wo n't be forced to just to make a payment .
say spend between 6000 10000 for a honda or toyota with 40000-80000 miles .
you will still have many years of dependable driving on it including uber if you want but you would n't be forced to drive just to make a car payment on a depreciating asset .
keep in mind at some point you will presumably graduate and start your career and driving uber after work every day may not be so appealing in a few years .

op this is sexual assault it 's a crime and it 's not acceptable .
you would be totally justified in filing a police report .
it 's so ingrained in us to downplay this stuff but it makes total sense that you 're still upset and stewing over this .
you do n't deserve to have your sexual boundaries ignored being fwb a year ago does n't entitle him to your body and you do n't deserve to be frightened so badly .
this is n't something that can or should be swept under the rug .
please reach out to someone even just your local sexual assault hotline and talk it out with someone who gets it .

a live-ball foul committed by the offense when the ball is beyond the line of scrimmage is enforced from the spot of the foul .
beyond the line '' meaning it 's either in possession or a loose ball not just a pass in the air .
most live-ball fouls by the defense are enforced from the original line of scrimmage as are all other live-ball fouls by the offense .
personal fouls by the defense are usually enforced from the end of the play .
dead-ball fouls are enforced from the end of the play and the down counts .

contrary to what people assume the lakers were not unstoppable .
they were taken to the brink by the blazers in 2000 and the kings in 2002 .
and the warriors are better than both those teams .
it 's true that shaq would absolutely feast but the lakers do n't have anyone to matchup against durant either .
that 's absurd especially now when star powers give a solid advantage .
yes a skilled player can beat out one that is n't regardless of upgrades but to say it should n't factor them in at all makes no sense

the natural habitat of a dog is hundreds of miles of wilderness so replicating natural habit is n't the typical measure for which captivity is considered humane .
anyway humane or not and whether there 're other ways or not does n't negate the question of whether this way does more harm than good .
my guess is is that it does quite a bit more good than harm for the long-term benefit of the species .
i thought it was just a random tag for someone until i came to the comments .

my dog tried it when she was about 8 or 9 months old too .
we were lucky that she did n't succeed in catching the child and that i knew exactly how to train her afterwards to prevent it from happening again shock collar .
now that same dog is a totally different dog just a few months later .
she is easily the most well-behaved gentle sweet animal i 've ever had and listens to every command for the most part .
she 'd be dead if she got the kid though but she did n't know any better at the time because it is n't like people dangle kids in front of puppies to see how they react .

if i had n't been in the market for a bluetooth speaker i probably would n't have bothered .

mikrottaminen on epäluotettava tapa koska mikron sisäisen kentän geometria on tuntematon jokainen muistipiirikortti ja muistisirumalli on erilainen ja lopputulos riippuu myös piirin asemoinnista kenttään .
riippuen ihan siitä mihin kohtaan mikrossa pistät ssd-levyn saattaa kärähtää osa tai kaikki piireistä .
sitä ei voi tietää missä kohtaa piiriin muodostuu 1000v tai 10v jännite-eroja .
toiset piirilevyt voivat myös olla huomattavasti parempia antenneja kuin toiset .
periaatteessa mikrossa on seisovien aaltojen kenttä ja kupukohdissa on tyhjässä ilmassa kentänvoimakkuus luokkaa 10kv/m mutta tästä kentästä tehon kytkeytyminen piirilevylle tai mikropiiriin joko sähkökenttä tai magneettikenttäkomponentista on melko lailla monimutkainen ongelma .
jotain kytkeytyy varmasti ja jos ei muuten pelkkä eristeiden lämpeäminen ja terävien metallireunojen kipinöinti alkaa nopeasti rikkoa komponentteja .

we all know its worth more than its trading at and that proof of stake will make it so that the more you 've stacked the greater reward you 'll be able to earn as a validator on the network .
why sell the very thing that will become a passive income generating asset on a network loads of people already are and will be using .
the more transactions happening on ethereum the more you stand to earn as an honest validator .
now couple that with when you know there will be a bunch of others trying to buy to get in on that action .

de had a bad history of listening to feedback and implementing changes so it wo n't ever improve .
i heavily disagree if anything they are extremely good at handling feedback .
just look back at the times when when syndicates were released or when the void was revamped .
id rather say they get some releases wrong but they are good at fixing their mistakes and listening to the community .
if damage 2.5 brings trouble then you can be darn sure de will listen to the community .
if they did n't how in the hell could warframe have become such a succesful game ?

iu is not considered an idol by pretty much anyone
it 's ironic that you are stating this in this very post where she 's topping the idol list .
the people are asked about the 3 idol they liked this year and the answer is in freeform it 's not like they chose iu from a list .
they just thought of iu when they heard the word idol and she 's topping that list with almost 15 percent..
so i think that makes your statement kinda invalid .
the problem is that its either black or white .
i am perfectly fine with working 50 hours a week and taking the weekend completely off which ive done in the past 6 month .
the thing is that in order to be able to take the weekend off i got to have a few days in the week where i can fully grind .

i like to wake up to the smell of bacon sue me .

du er så opphengt i rasisme at du ikke ser noe annet .
har du lest artikkelen og sett hva slags kommentarer denne jenta har fått ?
jeg vil heller si at det er du som er så opphengt i visse forestillinger at du er blind for den åpenbare rasismen vi her ser .
en islamist og en nazist må begge forvente skarp kritikk spesielt om man blir opphøyd som et forbilde for andre .
hun er ikke islamist så vidt jeg kan se ut fra de tingene hun har skrevet og sagt .
hvor har du det fra at hun er islamist ?
du hadde sikkert rynket kraftig på nesen om en med hakekors tatovert i panna hadde blitt kåret årets trønder .
hun er i første omgang offer for rasisme av folk som deg mindre forventningers rasisme er fortsatt rasisme .
oppmerksomheten dit i første omgang er ikke usannsynlig pc rasisme men å glatt overse en tilhørighet til en voldelig totalitær rasistisk ideologi er uten tvil en alvorlig form for rasisme .
her tror jeg du skal tenke deg litt ekstra om .
men som religiøse flest finner du deg nok ikke i den tankegangen det kan jo utfordre verdensbildet du føler deg trygg i .

i have been interested in crypto since the early stages and have been exposed to it early and often at many freedom type festivals .
i never was able to mentally make the leap into bitcoin and am still skeptical of its practicality today especially with the high fees and transaction times .
dash really intrigues me as a more stable and practical application and i want to use that as my entry point into crypto .
i am admittedly ignorant of the current landscape and came to this reddit hoping for information to help start new users .
i think it would be great to have some type of faq or post to introduce reliable methods for entering and using dash in different markets security best practices current best uses for trade etc .
all of the recent posts are more of updates on pricing and future potential .
still a lot of new people out there interested in getting involved but need more information on experiences and successes .

i played way back in high school in the late 80 's 2nd edition ? .
i 've bought a few of the new 5th edition books players guide dm guide and at one point did the little intro adventure in the starter set with my wife and son .
my eldest is 9 now and has expressed some interest in maybe doing some d d with his friends and i 'd love to dm for them .
i 'm wondering on suggestions on a pre-made adventure .
i remember way back in the day playing stuff out of dungeon magazine and buying little adventure packs at the store .
hoard of the dragon queen and rise of tiamat .
is this the best route for a rookie/rusty dm and noobie kids as players ?
honestly i 'd rather have something simpler i do n't need a bunch of backstory jibber jabber or not too much .

i 've been thinking of taking this cognitive psychology class this term as an elective prof is chris herdman .
thinking it should be fairly easy for me since my only other class is neur 3204 this term and all my other electives i have taken in the past are psyc/neuro classes along with cgsc1001 .
i completed them on my titan and got an engram from each completion .
changed to my warlock completed the crucible one it said updated but no engram .
do you only get the engrams one character per day ?

recently i discovered a corner of youtube where british girls talk about their experience with autism/aspergers .
i was confused because for many of them nothing about them seemed to fit the main criteria for asd which as i understand is social diffuculties .
in these videos the girls tend to express a lot of frustration about how people wont believe their diagnosis .
the girls on these channels say that having issues reading social cues and expressing typical social behavior is a stereotype and not a necessary component of asd .
so i decided to look it up to see if they were right .
as it turns out the dsm-5 american standards lists social struggles as the main criteria for an asd diagnosis see pearson clinical pdf autism spectrum disorder dsm-5 .
whereas the icd-10 europpean standards does not place nearly as heavy of an emphasis on social struggles for an asd diagnosis .
conclusion just because someone does n't understand why you 've been diagnosed with asd doesnt mean they 're stereotyping you .
they might just come from a counry where asd is defined differently .
i will be kindly receptive to other points of view .
my buddy and i have a disagreement on cinema 309..
i say there is some insane action going on there ...
he thinks theres just a bunch of guys sitting around waiting on something to happen .
we both are afraid to go there to find out !
so i was wondering if i buy the battle pass when im in like lvl 20 of the free pass would i still get the rewards for the lvls i missed for the battle pass ?
i got a little bored being stuck in the house due to the weather so i drew winter wonder orianna to pass the time .
its style looked like the new jojo 's bizarre adventure
i do n't know the story other than weird things are happening in an isolated japanese mansion/estate/mountain retreat like murder or dead bodies showing up .
it has a trippy '' style too like gankutsuou the count of monte cristo/death parade
there were only 2 characters a dude and the obligatory weird girl kid .
i think there are others but they are rarely seen .
edit it has realistic '' body types like jojo 's bizarre adventure and not the loli '' build
edit the setting of the anime isolated mansion '' estate '' was made for rich people for something .
contemporary excluding the mystery supernatural plot its a normal '' world ie not fantasy/magic non scifi steampunk or such .
iirc there was a scene where a wormhole '' and maybe it transported a dead body .
edit ca n't find it on myanimelist from 2016 to 2017 so it must be some hipster shit or the tags used in myanimelist was wrong .
will try earlier years but im pretty sure its either 2016/2017
so there 's this girl i 've been talking to she 's really shy irl so we do n't talk a ton and i usually initiate all the convos .
but on snap she 's very outgoing and starts tons of convos .
i also catch her staring/glancing at me a good amount so i figure i might have a chance .
last week i text her asking if she wants to go off campus for lunch with me and some friends and other girls and she does n't open it until lunch and says sry i just saw this so idk .
she hasnt been to class yet this week and i have 2 days left until break so i feel like i need to ask her before break .
should i just go for it and ask if she wants to go with me to this chinese lantern festival in my town over the break ?
i just turned on espn and its streaming in 60fps on the 2nd gen. includes espn family of networks as well as fox network channels fox local fs1 fs2 fox sports regional btn fx fxx fxm fox news and fox business .
i 'm currently interested in nootropics or substances that target the frontal lobe .
that 's because the frontal lobe is essential for a person 's ability to focus .
for example adhd patients have a frontal lobe that does n't function as well as a normal persons brain .
and so improving the function of the frontal lobe would mean improving a person 's ability to focus to remember information and work with information much better .
without sufficient focus it becomes harder to remember facts learn and work with/analyze information .
so when i first saw this platform i had a good feeling about it .
i just thought this could be the next davor or something along those lines .
it also has a pretty huge following just given the numbers on facebook .
i 'm wondering how everyone feels after the terrible launch .
have any of these successful lending platforms had similar issues ?
just sucked knowing i had 300 worth of bitcoin that i could have already put into other coins or a platform like exacoin ... any one have any input ?

jake paul is the worst rapper/singer alive and he 's a bitch .
so i 've posted some stories about my own attempts to run a tabletop game and the disaster that ensued over on r/gametales .
this time i figured i 'd share one of the worst game experiences i 've ever had with d d 3.5
the gm was probably the first red flag i should have seen .
a buddy from high school he was an aspiring writer with a leaning toward crap-sack worlds and evil characters .
when he was a player he played lawful evil '' which in practice was much closer to chaotic murderhob and almost always played a race with devil heritage or a class getting powers from an infernal source .
for the game he wanted to use the midnight campaign setting .
the unique thing about midnight is that it took place in a planarly locked world in a setting were the equivalent of sauron won .
due to this every god devil and extra-planar entity had noped out and sealed the blasted sphere from the rest of the multiverse so the bbeg could n't escape .
so instead he had brutally conquered everything on the plane ruling it with an evil encrusted fist and an army of orcs .
despite this the races of the world had managed to survive subjugated by a tyrannical lord and in constant threat of being pillaged and murdered by roving bands on an evil army .
our gm insisted that we use the races from the the setting but could use standard d d 3.5 classes instead of the ones from the book .
since i did n't like the classes presented i decided to be just a basic beat-stick .
i built a two weapon fighting elf and used my surplus of feats to buy off the disadvantages of such a build .
next we had a player who i will call dwayne cause he was a human defender class unique to midnight was was all about that sweet sweet grappling .
he built his character to tackle pin and then coup-de-gra his opponents into submission with additional damage from armor spikes and unarmed attacks .
then we had legolass since she was an elf rouge or some subset of elf midnight has like seven who used a bow and had backup daggers .
she was often getting mauled due to having very few hit points but had the highest damage out put against flat footed enemies .
he was only around for a single session then left due to scheduling conflicts and not enjoying our dm 's style .
he played a shifter from eberron not sure why the dm okayed it and i ca n't remember what his class was but it does n't matter as he died in the first session .
prior to the start of the game i had played in two or three of dm 's other campaigns .
they had some good moments but the games were dominated by his obsession with devils and all things hellish .
what was worse than his devil boner were old characters of his who had become major god 's in his setting bossing us around being insufferable to deal with and impossible to fight .
when i heard that he would be using a premade setting for his new game i jumped at the chance since there was no way he could fuck up a setting which was planarly locked .
so we made characters hopped on skype and dived into dm 's game .
he dropped us in a little shanty town in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and let us meet in a tavern like all good parties do .
being players we all congregate to each other and form a party with relative ease .
then we start asking around about anything strange going on anything the good townsfolk might need help with since we 're all broke as shit and want to earn some coin .
in the greatest feat of dm-ing i have ever seen the dm assumed us casually asking if people would like some work done was us screaming at the top of our lungs that we were adventurers .
see in midnight adventurers are n't allowed since the bbeg has ultimate power and regularly purges villages for lesser infractions like it being tuesday .
in response the town guard round up the party drag us through the city beating my character 's head into the pavement when i ask where we 're going and are thrown in jail .
so in jail the mayor comes down to meet us and apologizes for the rough treatment .
my character is literally bandaging the gashes on his head and nursing his 2 hp pool at this point so i 'm salty .
rest of the party has been roughed up so they are n't happy either .
then the mayor says he 's willing to let us go but only if we agree to do a job for him .
so the party agrees and we are told that the children of the town have all been kidnapped save the child of the blacksmith .
this is pretty serious as there 's about a hundred people in the town so for all the children to be taken means that some serious shit has been going down for a while .
we agree to investigate and all split up promising to meet up at the tavern in an hour game time .
dwayne and legolass had to the blacksmith since dwayne is apparently the face and legolass has good investigate skills since she 's a rogue .
i go to talk to the local magic expert since elves have innate magic in midnight and i had the highest int in the party .
and wulf goes back to the tavern and sulks investigates the bottom of his drink .
at the blacksmiths dwayne and legolass get to chatting with the man and he offers to help them out with whatever they need as long as we keep his son safe .
the players agree and promise that the party will stake out his home that night to protect the kid .
while talking legolass notes that there 's a symbol carved into the arch of his doorway but neither of them can identify it .
for my part i hang out with an almost senile old wizard who turns out to be an important character from one of dm 's other games !
despite that spatial impossibility the npc is chill and coughs up a few minor scrolls he 's had squirreled away which is huge as magic is super restricted in midnight .
i express my gratitude and head over to meet up with the other to players at the blacksmiths .
when asked why wulf replies that nothing interesting is happening so dm takes pity '' on him and has him overhear some of the villagers mention an old shrine out in the forest .
now interested wulf gets up and sets out immediately to go investigate this shrine .
or waiting till we get back since we we 're heading back to meet up anyway .
so off wulf trots into the forest which is described as warm and welcoming at first then quickly darkens and takes on spooky under-and-overtones as wulf presses deeper .
he has a good ten minute lead on us when we get to the tavern and learn that he left for the forest .
as much shit as i will give dm he was a good sport about letting us try and save wulf 's stupid ass .
so the three of us take off running after him .
doing the math we figure out that it will take us about 3 minutes to catch up to him and all he has to do is stay put .
instead he presses on now hearing whispering voices and seeing things just at the edge of his vision .
as he pushes deeper the air grows cold and his paws crunch in grass that 's now covered in a light dusting of frost .
still he pushes on despite all of us yelling at him to stop .
finally the trees thin and he emerges into a clearing in the center of which is an old stone altar shaped like a table with intricate carvings that have long faded with time .
its covered in vines and moss and the top of altar is stained a deep red .
wulf 's enhanced canine senses easily identifies the stains as recently spilled human blood .
now i may have mentioned that midnight is planarly locked .
i think i particularly harped upon that fact earlier as it was the main reason i decided to subject myself to one of dm 's games again as he would be unable to wank his devil boner in this particular setting .
above the altar a rift rips open spilling out fetid hot air as a giant white-blue bug looking motherfucker steps out wielding a spear coated in frost and blood .
wulf drops into a stance getting ready to fight as we spill out of the trees behind him just in time to get hit with a mass-paralyzing gaze from the creatures compacted eyes .
we bail grabbing legolass and bolting as the creature jumps and impales wulf on its frozen prong .
it then drags him back with it through the rift which seals behind it with a sizzling pop .
now for those of you who are n't experts on devilish creatures which crawled from satan 's ass-crack that was an ice devil .
that horrendous bullshit aside this encounter was what should have tipped me off .
the dm had inserted a devil into a world where devils could not exist .
when i and dwayne called him on this he explained that the planar lock was weakening resulting in small rifts in the world through which extra-planar entities and outsiders could enter .
what the dm actually told us with this was that he did n't give a shit about the setting and he just wanted us to play in a crap-sack world where evil had won with no higher powers to help us and infernal forces sneaking in to steal the children that roving orcs had n't yet murdered .
instead our party headed back to town we all went to the blacksmith and got ourselves silvered weapons .
the story goes on with more and more outrageous things happening as my bullshit tolerance is severely tested but remembering this has left a bad taste in my mouth .
i 'll post more of the campaign later if my brain does n't purge all the remaining memories by then .
i took his 1 and then his 4 and i do n't regret either at all .
i am sort of interested in the one that extends the time of his speed ups and the one that gives a chance to reduce cooldown on all his powers .
the only problem with those is they are both conditional .
i know everyone said to take the one that puts two speed downs on characters but that seems kind of chickenshit to me .
asked in the youtube comments several times no help .
i usually buy the game when the 50 off vc sale drops and when the game is n't full price .
any confirmation if it 's like the same time every year they do the sale ?

overall the sex is everything i could ever ask for .
he loves me and i love him in the end that makes it whole for the two of us .
but there is one thing the only issue we really seem to have most of the time..
we 've talked about it fought about it and laughed about it .
i 've heard every excusable explanation that he 's felt he could share .
and i know that on some level they must be true right ?
i but that 's not what i need your help with .
if you 've ever struggled with a similar situation or maybe you 're a man yourself who does n't enjoy eating pussy please tell me about it !
i wish to hear stories for not only comfort that i 'm not alone in this but that he is n't either .
ever had a partner who would n't eat pussy ?
from the brief research i 've done australia has 33 of the world 's uranium .
the liberal party has according to wikipedia been in support of australia adopting nuclear energy for many decades now with recent examples being tony abbott advocating for a repeal on the nuclear power plant ban .
why are we not using our wealth of uranium to supplement our energy supplies .
it would satisfy all sides of political spectrum being a clean power source whilst also not being affected by the ridiculous idea that solar/wind is unreliable as it does n't rely on weather conditions to function .
it would also create 'jobs and growth ' with low-level labour as well as more complicated jobs such as nuclear engineering being introduced to the australian labour market thus reducing the so called 'brain drain ' that australia has been facing .
overall it seems illogical for us to continue to deny the benefits of nuclear power whilst countries such as france out leaving us in the dust .
typically for mmorpgs or most games really i like to rebind commands that i need to use all the time to those mouse buttons .
it does not seem as applicable to gw2 though since you can set skills to auto-attack .
so what are some commands you bind to m4 and m5 for your game ?
it feels bloated and slow and i 'm considering moving my gaming rig over to ubuntu .
i 'm aware i 'll lose compatibility with a few games but yeah .

hey guys i 'm a freshmen currently and i 'm planning to apply to the foster business school next year .
i 'm trying to get all my math class done this year and have signed up for math 111 algebra with application with professor ebru bekyel for winter 2018 then 112 calculus for econ business during spring .
however i 'm wondering if it will be more beneficial for my admission to the business school if i am taking the 124 path ?
i have taken up to pre-calculus back in high school .
i do n't think i will have any problem handling 111 and 120 this up-coming quarter and i do think that 111 112 path should be easier .
however i just want to hear from you guys whether if i should take the 120 124 path instead ?

title binance does n't require all the verification for a quick exchange so i 'm just wondering about this .
so it 's been awhile since i 've played paragon .
currently i 'm installing the game and have been watching a few videos on youtube .
this new card system seems a bit confusing and not nearly as diverse as the old .
also i played kwang offlane and jungle sparrow gideon countess jungle started to play a little bit of gadget and serath jungle .
i was pretty young when half life 2 first came out .
must 've been 7 when it first hit the pc .
playing the game today still blows me away i mean it looks dated in some areas sure .
but the technology behind the source engine is still pretty impressive .
so this is a question for half life fans who have been hyping half life 2 since launch .
did you have to upgrade your pc to get decent fps even on low settings ?
did half life 2 at the time really pushed your system to the limit ?

today i wired funds from my td usd account to gemini .
td told me they do n't do same day wire transfers and it would take about 3 business days for the funds to reach them .
according to the wire deposit instructions via email it says if you initiate anything other than a same-day wire transfer it will be rejected on our end . ''
anyone from canada use td to wire money to their gemini account successfully ?
since td does n't offer same day wire transfers which bank did you use to wire money ?
i 've attempted to signup on bittrex over a week ago and no movement on my verification .
poloniex requires a webcam which i do n't have .
how is it i get verified on coinbase in seconds but bittrex is going on 9 days .
i 'm about to divert my mining out of fear of being stuck with coins i ca n't use .
any other suggestions before i throw in the towel ?
had their 60/5 now have 100/10 did n't have to call or anything .
confirmed by some friends in the area as well .
i was listening to an extremely ranty interview on npr last night and the guest was complaining among other things about how the us economy is a debt-based system and also how divorced wall street trading is from any actual investment in a company and i had an idea what if instead of taking on debt from investment banks corporations first approached their shareholders and asked them to bond '' their shares feeding the dividends for a set period of time back into the company with the understanding that said dividends would be paid back with interest after the bond period ended on a set repayment schedule ?
i 'm a shareholder of vadercorp and the ceo asks me to bond my shares for ten years during which my dividends instead of being paid out to me are considered a long-term loan to the company so that they can afford better training .
after the ten years my regular dividend payouts resume but lord vader also owes me the sum of the dividends i did n't collect plus interest to be paid out over the next six years .
this means that the interest that would be going to a bank instead goes into my pocket and i 'm a little bit more intimately involved in the decision to allow the company to take on more debt .
i have n't heard of anything like this but i 'm an electrical engineer not an investment banker .
can anyone tell me if something like this already exists or if not what would be involved in making it a reality ?
so i 've got around 18x budged and i was looking for a fun build to make that could handle most of the content quite fast mapping and good bosskiller got any recommendations ?
been searching for the book all day and could n't find it .

i have moved all my meda to a wd portable drive attached to my router as nas .
i use deluge as a client but apparently it will not accept a network location as a default save location .

is there any way to set a torrent download path in bulk for all the shows i watch ?

i remember back in the prime halo days how much fun it was to make maps and play online with others .
it did n't matter if it was ctf or just slayer .
it seems that today more than ever there is a lack of simplicity in games like halo used to be .
i quit playing about the time of halo 4 when they started changing things up .
are there any games out there that have forge capabilities ?
besides what 's more fun than being competitive with your friends ?

my hunts go fine but after around 5-10 minutes i 'll randomly get stuck in place and nothing i do will let me leave .
i 'm also immune to damage and i 'm just stuck until i abandon the quest .
a similar thing will happen when i try to move to a new area .

i can still move around and abandon the quest through the menu but i ca n't see anything .
i play halo 1 at my school and i tried to download the game at home but it was n't compatible with my windows 10 .

i was just playing shadow of morder the original and i just did a mission that started me on one side of the map and had me walk to the exact opposite side with 3 stops to pick herbs .
90 of the mission was just walking following an npc .
i feel like this mechanic is becoming increasingly common in openworld games where a good portion of mission time is just empty travel time .
i noticed it in shadow of morder i noticed it in farcry 4 i feel like it is an increasingly common mechanic .
i 'm wondering if anyone enjoys missions that contain large amounts of and if not where does the line come between travel time that is fine and travel time that is annoying. ?
this is the best tl dr i could make original http www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42420829 reduced by 71 .
the bank of england is to unveil plans allowing european banks to operate in the uk as normal post-brexit .
branches offer an easy way for banks to move money around their international operations but present the risk that in the event of a financial crisis funds are quickly repatriated to the foreign bank 039 s headquarters leaving customers of the uk branch out of pocket .
changing from a branch to a subsidiary could cost billions for a bank like deutsche bank for example which employs 9,000 people in the uk .
currently banks based anywhere in the eu can sell services to anywhere else in the eu thanks to an instrument known a financial services passport .
quot encouraging eu banks to continue to operate in the uk will help preserve financial stability for the uk and the eu and will help defend london 039 s position as an open global financial centre quot he said .
forcing eu bank branches in the uk to become separately capitalised subsidiaries may well have encouraged european banks to pull out of london gradually eroding its pre-eminence as a financial centre .
services sold by the uk branch of a french or german bank to a third country like the us for example count as uk exports something the government is keen to maximise .

i am only 25 but noticed that i have uneven skin tone all over my body which looks horrible on direct lighting and extremely large pores from years of battling acne .
i am a guy so it might not be much of an issue but it makes me feel insecure when everyone else has good skin .
a female friend recommended me tretinoin all over the body and in the face for the pores .
she told me her problem got fixed in a year .
money is not the problem but is it the most effective way to make sure that i wont get lighter on parts that do n't look dull ?
she gave me one tube to start but i do n't want to damage my skin more than it is .
i have a history of procrastination but up until my senior year of high school my smarts allowed me to coast through classes .
i never learned hardwork and that year i got into drugs in an attempt to learn how to be social .
and i had to really work in order to graduate anyways .
my parents went through hell during all of this just so i could get to college ...
i got there and for maybe a month i worked consistently .
until i subtlely went to less ... and less ... and less .
i had such a huge hole of work in some of my classes .
i wound up failing cs and calculus this semester and i passed seminar in composition and my political science class by the skin of my teeth .
but i kept telling my parents everything was fine .
and if they know i failed this semester everything is over .
i ca n't go to college to see the friends i did n't have in high school i ca n't continue my career without a college degree let alone with only one semester .
i ca n't live with my parents or the shame .
i have more classes i 'm signed up for but does it even fucking matter ?
my heart is pounding in my chest and none of the drugs i used are here in the house for me to force myself to ignore this .
i just want to fucking die right now and as more time passes i 'm running out of reasons to live .
but i do n't think i have a choice .
there 's a car there 's rope the only thing thats stopping myself is me .
i almost threw myself out my dorm window and i stopped myself .

the second day calls for 30-45 minutes of liss which i think is a nice recovery for my legs but i do n't know if i 'll always be able to do liss multiple times per week .
maybe it 's just because it 's cold right now so i have to use the treadmill but i think it 's really boring !
i like running on the treadmill so i have trouble holding myself back to walk at 3.8 mph for the entire time .

all traffic should be at full speed only limited by the bandwidth you 're paying for from the start the network should n't care who 's the origin .
making the network behave differently and building it so that most traffic is slow and only whitelisted traffic is fast is an obvious violation of net neutrality .
it means the entire network is built to only allow handpicked services to get full speed .

yes because solar and batteries which have no real on-going costs once installed are surely the blame for high energy prices as opposed to private companies shutting down old as shit coal power stations while continuing to operate others that use a finite and relatively expensive resource all while trying to maximize profits with little in the way of government assistance because we 're led by smacktards who do n't understand that having people spend less while cutting corners on future infrastructure projects is n't actually a good way to stimulate the economy

not the actual pharmacist or technician themselves we have a courier .
i know other pharmacies where a technician delivers the meds it 's not required though .
edit it 's not in all of germany where most meds are delivered at least i do n't think so if i was n't clear .
i work in a rural area so people have to drive a bit to get to the nearest pharmacy which means pharmacies are basically forced to offer a delivery service to stay competitive ... plus the law says so .
from what i gathered from the post i think her resentment does come from the parent .

most i 've been excited about the game all year .
i honestly never thought we 'd see the day .
not to mention that because of quotas and endless media attention some groups may feel pressurised into using characters from minority backgrounds in their products to prevent any negative attention when there really should n't be a problem with them choosing whoever they feel is necessary for their product .
the implication in the article is that those from minority backgrounds need to have people of their race/gender featured in video games so that they can relate to the game which i find ridiculous as if the shoe was on the other foot and a game featuring a majority black roster was being lamented for not having enough white british people in it because they feel that 'black people do n't represent them ' the complaint would have a definite air of white superiority about it .
i think the basis of the article is absolutely mental and i ca n't believe people are employed to obsess over issues such as these .
white middle class people make games that represent them and their characters do n't look like asian or black inner-city people '' .

i played 8 heroic got 25 11 15 17 and 22 gifts average 18 .
in coop when alternating runs this gives 36 gifts for 3 verdium 12/verdium
played 123 heroic five times 44 46 48 50 and 42 average 46 .
in coop when alternating runs this gives 92 gifts for 13 verdium 7.1/verdium
8 heroic is much better than 123 but it requires more grinding .
of course if you manage to assist someone and not pay any verdium than 123 is a steal .
yes but crytek seems to have issues with that part .
before you transfer to any exchange do your due diligence .
i have found truspilot to be pretty good in this regard .
people can leave reviews and the owners or cs for the exchange can reply to reviews if they are so inclined .
a lot of the exchanges are struggling to cope with the increase in new users and simply do n't have the capacity to deal with problems resulting in a them suspending new user registration while they deal with the demand .
the last thing you want is to be stuck in a dispute for weeks without your ticket being resolved .
other things that i have discovered is that it 's hard to find an exchange that accepts fiat currencies usd/gbp etc .
and the ones that do seem to charge extremely high fees .
i 'm in the uk and used bittylicious because they are strict on verification and have good reviews but as mentioned above the fees are high .
i took the hit because i wanted peace of mind as much as one can find in this sphere .
a lot of the big exchanges are only crypto to crypto which presents another hurdle in that i had to find an exchange that lets me buy with fiat withdraw the crypto to my wallets .
then the scary part of it for me is to pick an exchange that i want to deal with and has the cryptos that i wish to trade .
i 'm in for the long haul so am taking my time and still learning .
sure i 'll miss opportunities as we all will but at least i 'm on the ride .

within the northeast the netherlands the kingdom of france sweden and the uk each had their colonies prior to it just becoming the uk canada and the us .
the netherlands could hypothetically pay restitutions along with the united states canada and maybe even the beloved swedes ... but then we get to the murkier bit with france .
french revolution the republic napoleon the republic again napoleon again the republic again vichy france and back to the republic .
does that mean that france still could still pay for whatever atrocities/exploitations/etc that happened in their colonies and interactions with the tribes there ?
yes ... but there 's quite a bit of wiggle room with the whole kingdom-republic-empire-republic-empire-republic-nazi occupation-republic '' in that they are n't the same france that had the colonies .
i think as turrets and pylons get expanded purpose the van may be a powerhouse of multirole-combat .
it does n't need a design pass like the origins do but it could use one .
it 's currently outside of its design role being almost bested by less combat oriented ships .
it currently excels at turreting up on even slower targets but so does the bucc/hornet/bombers .
the rotation max accel/jerk parameters are still too low i feel like i 'm always looking 1-2 seconds behind where i want to be looking which is garbage for dogfighting .
the rotation max speed parameter needs to be the defining limitation of this ship not accel/jerk .
the forward/reverse parameters are too poor for a ship with such glorious engines .
this needs to be a ship that an experienced player knows not to joust but right now it 's pretty much guaranteed that you 're going to keep on it until one of you dies .
conversely the armor is too high because the developers could n't differentiate redundancy from hp back when this ship went gold to ac .
the canard guns.. actually do n't bother me much aside from being useless because of terrible rotation accel/jerk .
it would help if the developers clarified that this mount will have options .
i strongly dislike the state of the current default gun which spools up before firing underscoring an already deficient ship rotation rate .

now legally they could make this post disappear and all the negativity with it .
all the men on the team making eye-contact with each other during group discussions but their eyes never meet with either of the two women 's .
not saying that you do n't work in an environment where sexism is normalized but this particular part of it likely is n't .
the average guy who ends up in a computer-related roll is n't likely to have the best social skills and i can absolutely see how something like making eye contact with someone of the opposite sex omg a girl '' could be something that they 'd be uncomfortable with omg she 's gon na think i 'm into her and being unprofessional if i make eye contact omg it 's super awkward !
maybe that 's not it at all but that was my first thought .
legally someone still has to be at the wheel to take over if something happens .

they were talking about treating the game as a service regular updates and catering to multiple demographics and firor was patting himself on the back .
citing a bunch of shit that 's been there since launch and the extremely lacklustre daily loop is irrelevant and self-defeating respectively .
nothing happens in this game for months at a time .
they do n't even have a cheesy 'community manager ' throwing a hand-picked rehash quest at you once a week or something to that effect .
even the bloody news section in the launcher is padded with fucking cosplay shite now on top of the usual crown store updates .
i do n't mind it too much would rather have decent than rushed content .

what has changed at zos and has resulted in such a tremendous shift in their output between the early dlc releases and now ?

pestilence has been attacked ruthlessly for their last three albums with the term generic '' hurled at them more than anything else by far .
i have always disagreed with that assessment i thought each of those albums were mostly filled with great riffing .

large plastic web electrostatic problems results and cure d. swenson 3m company
tremendous static charge generation on a plastic web causes unique physical phenomena and special problems .
david swenson of 3m corporation describes an anomaly where workers encountered a strange invisible wall '' in the area under a fast-moving sheet of electrically charged polypropelene film in a factory .
this invisible wall '' was strong enough to prevent humans from passing through .
a person near this wall '' was unable to turn and so had to walk backwards to retreat from it .
this occurred in late summer in south carolina august 1980 in extremely high humidity .
polypropelene pp film on 50k ft. rolls 20ft wide was being slit and transferred to multiple smaller spools .
the film was taken off the main roll at high speed flowed upwards 20ft to overhead rollers passed horizontally 20ft and then downwards to the slitting device where it was spooled onto shorter rolls .
the whole operation formed a cubical shaped tent with two walls and a ceiling approximately 20ft square .
the pp film had been manufactured with dissimilar surface structure on opposing faces .
contact electrification can occur even in similar materials if the surface textures or micro-structures are significantly different .
the generation of a large imbalance of electrical surface-charge during unspooling was therefore not unexpected and is a common problem in this industry .
on entering the factory floor and far from the equipment mr. swenson 's 200kv/ft handheld electrometer was found to slam to full scale .
when he attempted to walk through the corridor formed by the moving film he was stopped about half way through by an invisible wall . ''
he could lean all his weight forward but was unable to pass .
he observed a fly get pulled into the charged moving plastic and speculates that the e-fields might have been strong enough to suck in birds !
the production manager did not believe mr. swenson 's report of the strange phenomena .
when they both returned to the factory floor they found that the wall '' was no longer there .
but the production workers had noticed the effect as occurring early in the morning when humidity was lower so they agreed to try again another day .
the second attempt was successful and early in the morning the field underneath the tent '' was strong enough to raise even the short curly hair of the production manager .
he commented that he did n't know whether to fix it or sell tickets . ''
problems coulomb forces would be expected to attract a person into the chamber '' formed by the pp film and the attractive force should increase linearly across distance .
there should be no wall '' in the center a discrete wall is repulsive also nonlinear .
if for some reason a person was repelled from the center of the chamber rather than being attracted there still should be no wall '' since the repulsion force should exist over a large distance it should act like a deep pillow which exerts more and more force as one moves deeper into it .
large fuzzy fields this is how magnets and iron behave and this is how e-fields and conductive objects should also behave .
a thought unspooling of film typically generates a much higher net charge on the long piece of film than on the small surface of the spool .
however since charge is created in pairs and net charge is conserved the imbalances of charge must be equal and opposite .
the charge on the entire length of moving film must be equal in magnitude to the charge on the spool .
yet the charge on the film is very large and is continuously increasing .
the limited surface-charge on the spool required that opposite charge is being lost through some unseen path .
very probably the spool is spewing out enormous quantities of ionized air with polarity opposite that of the charge on the moving plastic film .
charged air would be created by discharge in the cleft between film and spool as the film was peeled from the spool .
i wonder if film was being peeled from the top of the spool so that any ionized air created in the cleft would be launched into the tent-chamber '' region ?
if it was peeled from the bottom of the spool the charged air would end up outside the tent . ''
or if a corona discharge arises in the cleft between film and spool perhaps the uv and e-fields of this corona can ionize the air on both sides of the exiting plastic film and spray the charged air everywhere .
so if the charged tent '' of film is negative in the above situation and if a large quantity of positively charged air is being generated by the spool then perhaps the invisible wall '' is caused by a cloud of suspended air ions held in position by e-fields .
perhaps it 's a pressure gradient created by ionized air trapped under the tent by electrostatic attraction .
yet again this effect would be expected to create a diffuse zone of increasing force not a wall '' but an invisible pillow . ''
added note concrete floors behave as conductors resistors in this situation .
where megavolts at microamps are involved the division between insulators and conductors is at 10^6/10^-6 1000 gigaohms .
concrete resistivity is in the realm of megohms so it behaves like a grounded metal sheet .
however a volume of charged air is somewhat analogous to iron filings near a magnet .
if a solid sheet of iron filings is held in place by a magnet then a literal wall '' is created and this wall will resist penetration by nonferrous objects .
if in the above manufacturing plant a sheet of highly charged air is for some reason being held in place by the fields created by the charged film then a transparent wall '' made of charged air would come into being .
it might produce pressures on surfaces and resist penetration by human bodies .
my question is this if the entire situation could be turned on its side so the invisible wall '' became an invisible floor '' could a person stand on it ?

as an fm and some can say this is bad advice i normally just stay farthest away to become mark wait for him to cast heavens reach or wuteve it called words will appear on screen then cast sheath .
if people didnt i frame it saves them from dying
this just made me feel better about a movie called the last jedi and how i waited decades to see luke on screen again .
william says in the dream sequence that even if someone dies they 're not really gone .
my theory is that in lis death is n't the end .
our bodies are like a costume or a mask .
we put them on at birth and take them off when we die .
this can be seen in the first season when we always see deer or birds just different manifestations of rachel and william .
this also can explain samuel 's fascination with the squirrels .
samuel is eluded to as being a sort of medium between nature and us humans .
humans in the lis universe are just a part of nature like stars .
just because someone is dead or a star does n't make them less beautiful .
this also explains the idea that the storm at the end of the bae ending is rachel 's wrath/lonliness only being quelled with the bay 's destruction or with chloe joining her .
rachel 's monologue about us not being able to see the stars properly because we 're blinded by what is near may be a hint .
maybe we only see death because we only know people as who they are to us not who they actually are .
also every character that dies in the lis universe leaves a pet or takes another form .
william left and came back as a bird or possibley as chloe the raven .
it is good to point out that these animals are n't born after the death of said characters so either its all just coincidence i really doubt that or that 's just how reincarnation works .
after all what are children besides a combined carnation of their parents ?
thanks i will ... why did you even post here ?
huh never knew refs had to announce jersey number changes .
she 's been telling us from the get go how she 's sick of people lying to her .
the last thing she needs is for the one person she trusts to lie to her too .

most of his reviews are pretty well thought out and mbdtf is by far his most polarizing review
's on the map instead of encounters if you didnt have to pay your gold for removal from the whale hitting shops along the way and only spending on removal or if you find a clash or other useful skill being sold .
it is luck but it 's not hard to tailor runs when you know what you 're looking for and skip cards that do n't help .
which means theres a chance you have an awful deck by floor 2 but theres also a good chance you have either a strong deck or the building blocks of the deck that can carry you to floor 3 .
if you can get 1-2 clashes war cry/battle trance/card draw you can 1-3 turn most enemies on the second floor as long as you skip elites but even if you ca n't the shriek is your biggest threat but you can burn him really fast
no fun to be around at parties '' or similar is just a common phrase to say you sound like a boring/annoying shit .
those who ca n't accomplish will try to destroy the accomplishments of others '' .
hell it explains most of saddox 's actions as of late .
i do n't think anti-vaxxers are smart enough to think about it in those terms so ask them what kind of message it is sending to their children when they would rather risk their child dying than have them be autistic like their aunt/uncle .
not going to lie i used a save game editor back in the day when i used to play this game a lot .

this is so sad a majority of us cant live without internet a bunch of us live in apartments that have internet carriers in contracts so basically we are screwed no matter what ... why is this even being allowed ?
i know we are too small of an entity to make a difference but its so sad why cant we start something where we all cut the cord with our providers and let their stocks fall 1 week without internet how bad can that be ?
more time to go for the much needed walk '' or much needed gym workout ''
in that post they say everything is designed for running 90hz including the cable .
so there are likely a number of factors that might be causing this issue currently .
i 'm betting the hardware upscaler is one of them .
of course the majority occurs in the time you are actually going to school together .
but for me those final moments in both high school and college was where the actual plans were formalized .
not the ceremony but all of the related events .
honestly at the end of the day the best role to carry a group in this game is healer .
you 're very much in control of what little healing there is to do if you 're good you 'll provide a ton of additional dps and you can turn a bad situation into a good one .
most dps ca n't carry anything besides well ... damage output .
which is a good thing mind you but if your tank single pulls you 're screwed if your tank ca n't hold hate you 're screwed and now frustrated if your healer is terrible you 're super screwed .
as someone who 's mained healers during 3.x and now mains a dps job i 'm often astounded at how awful duty finder healers can be .
i 've seen a ton of people mention rdm yes rdm is nice to have around for a clutch rez every now and then but keep in mind we get rez very late during the leveling process but if you need a clutch rez so badly in a dungeon someone has n't been playing their role correctly .

i 'm at work and did n't have time to look through all the threads .
just figured gdt would be easy to get a quick answer
whoa i think the celtics would be more accurate seeing as they have the most nba titles overall i believe
i 'm not sure what makes you believe this .
in just about ever manufacturing sector automation has replaced large portions of human workers and there 's no sign that trend will stop .
i noticed it as well and it 's just a bit of cloud .
a lot of people on here also thought it could be something they probably should have touched that speck out in editing .
this looks like something you can buy at forever21 for like eight bucks .
it 's like rains of castamere on your red wedding day
it 's not like mercer has ever beaten a power conference school before ...
with our pp opponents have to lay off a little which gives us more room which forces opponents to take more penalties ... a beautiful thing .
dude i did the same thing i got to like level 12 without questing or skills .
batsmen like him with extraordinary hand eye coordination can thrive till 33-34 so he can get another 5000 runs during that period .
after that it is likely that he will go through a sharp decline in form and may not be able to play till 39-40 that the likes of kallis dravid sangakkara tendulkar did .
those players had great compact techniques which helped them extend their career .
even if he retires at 35-36 he will have amassed 12000 runs which puts him at atg batsmen .
if he can still maintain average of 60 that will be phenomenal .
giving good parking spaces is waaaaay more convenient than the pesky task of healing someone or preventing their eternal damnation .
that was a bizarre and bad choice for a song .
i liked the idea of biqtch 's smoke but we totally lost the girls in it .

chris christie said tuesday that president trump 's son-in-law and senior adviser jared kushner deserves the scrutiny '' he 's received from special counsel robert mueller 's team in the ongoing russia probe .
because he was involved in the transition and involved in meetings that call into question his role '' christie said on msnbc 's deadline white house . ''
if he 's innocent of that then that will come out as mueller examines all the facts and if he 's not that will come out too '' added christie a former federal prosecutor .
everybody by the way who was involved in that transition post the election ... all the leadership is going to be questioned and i think has been questioned . ''
kushner has faced scrutiny from mueller 's team for his contacts with foreign leaders as the special counsel investigates ties between trump campaign officials and russia .
kushner reportedly told trump 's former national security adviser michael flynn to contact russian officials before trump took office .
flynn pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the fbi while mueller 's team has brought charges against three other former trump campaign officials .
mueller 's team has also reportedly looked into a meeting kushner attended at trump tower in the summer of 2016 with other trump campaign staff members and a russian lawyer who promised dirt on democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton .
christie said tuesday it 's important for mueller not to prejudge '' anything in his investigation until all the facts come out .
whether kushner deserves scrutiny or not he 's getting it .
and the facts will determine that ultimately '' christie said .
christie and kushner have clashed in the past with the outgoing new jersey governor saying in an interview last month that he believes the president 's son-in-law was responsible for christie 's ouster from the transition team .
trump 's team announced shortly after the election that mike pence then the vice president-elect would replace christie in leading the transition team .
the funny part was when he put the gun away hux is afraid of kylo and that 's what made it funny ...
this hand of mine glows with an awesome power !

in combat we do n't measure things in minutes but in rounds .
a 'round ' is each character doing three actions a major move and minor .
the time a round takes is n't really set in stone but i 'd have to guess they 'd be a few seconds at most .
so with regards to your semblance i 'd change it to lasting semblance rounds possibly semblance/2 if mods think it 's a tad too strong .
a thing to consider with the maximum amount of them being summoned is that you can do a move action as your major so a turn with her could summon two walls without needing the stacking part of the semblance .
if you want to keep it being able to stack for one action i 'd limit it with a social stat/2 .
and also give it a range limit probably within presence yards .
blue touched on this a lot but your backstory is kinda edgy .
mostly the details about her and a few others randomly killing bystanders pushes it .
about the appearance and one of the merits she 's got a tail as her faunus feature but does that really help her hear things ?
the other thing is that a hunter 's uniform is meant to really pop .
just a sweater seems kinda bland and her only real defining features are the odd hairstyle and scars .
if you want to keep her outfit more on the down-low then i 'd change the hairstyle since that 'd stand out like a sore thumb in a crowd .
though that 's more my opinion and the design is yours to come up with .
i do think it 's pretty cute how she tries to look bigger which is something you should keep .
as a recommendation going for punk/delinquent styled clothing would give her a definite style that fits with her overall theme .
uh well like about 6 feet maybe 150-160 short blondish hair .

in a humidor the cigars are dry to start with and your packs are just to remove the tiny bit of humidity from the air exchange whenever you open the humidor .
in a curing chamber you are placing literally kilos of moisture saturated meat and expecting it to dry .
the packs are n't designed to absorb that much moisture .
now if you were talking a place you stored finished products and you wanted to keep the air at a specific humidity so that the meats do n't rehydrate then sure they 'd work since that is their actual purpose even with cigars .
but as the primary means of removing moisture it wo n't work .

a new game every year creates an unstable and inconsistant competitve fanbase .
why do you think the game from a competitive standpoint never really grew after bo2 because jetpacks almost killed it nobody enjoyed them .
if every player got into competitive at some point like you said i 'd garuntee you right now cod would be the largest esports in the world by a mile .
the game does n't appeal from a competitve standpoint to the much much larger scene in cod that is the casual gamer .

i like how you started out with seemingly honest question then just completely degenerated into a ragefest

arroyo has fucking 24 homers in 5 professional seasons .
he 's basically a fucking backup infielder at best .
his 2016 was spent entirely in double a and he could n't even post an ops above .700 .
i know he 's young but he has n't shown anything .
plus the rays currently have brad miller matt duffy arroyo top 30 prospect wily adames hechavarria and young guy daniel robertson .
and they only have 3 spots in the infield for them unless they want to play miller consistently at 1st which would be the dumbest idea of all time .

i 'm graduating from college and just now getting my driver 's license and first car since my job in may will require it for the commute .
my parents are paying for it upfront so i 'm mostly worried about repair costs gas mileage safety and how easy it is to drive – especially for an inexperienced/new driver .
we 're looking at a family friend 's car who 's moving back to china and is willing to sell his mercedes ml350 for 8,400 .
i know nothing about cars but it drove well and he said there 's been no maintenance issues except for a brake issue that the 400 in the 8400 accounts for .
my research online showed a lot of concern about this model 's maintenance issues past 100k miles and i 'm worried that as a new driver i 'll be sort of clueless with how to go about identifying them .
is it a good idea to go for this considering those concerns ?
mostly i 'm just looking for input from anyone who is familiar with mercedes cars past 100k miles regarding the hassle of maintenance .
right now sole survivor is a very underused perk and righfully so unless you are doing the niche loadout of ooo ss it has very little use .
i believe it could be used less as an encroaching stealth passive and more as a brief respite ability based on how many survivors are alive .
sole survivor you know what it takes to stay alive you are able to momentarily sever your link with the entity .
while inside a locker or crouching press the activate ability button to gain immunity to the killer's detection and aura reading abilities .
standing during this perk 's effects will end it prematurely .
the duration is affected by the remaining survivors in a trial .
this effect can only be triggered once every 90/80/70 seconds .
every survivor killed or sacrificed during a trial reduces the cooldown by 5/10/15 minimum cooldown of 77/56/39 seconds
a nurse 's calling only if the person being healed is crouching can only be done when another survivor is healing you

i bought a 3 pack ll120 rgb that has the hub and node pro included .
installed it connected the fans to the hub sequentially connected the hub to the node pro connected the node pro to the mb and connected both np and hub to sata power .
when i turned on my pc and boot up corsair link i updated the firmware .
1 added one fan that is automatically named fan 1-1 ''
3 both fan 1 and fan 2 changed to the settings i choose for fan 1-1 ''
4 at this time my third fan is not lighting up .
then i added another fan on the configure window it is automatically named fan 1-2 '' .
1 configuring for fan 1-2 '' will change the led of my third fan .
2 fan 1 and fan 2 is still messed up the led on those two fans seem to be mixed together will show in pic
i have checked the connections multiple times uninstall and reinstall cl multiple times same thing happened .
right now i am guessing that my hub is defective .
if anyone can come up with a suggestion or solution that would be awesome .
okay this is extremely silly.. but i do not know what to say to him .
i 'm working full time at the moment and go to school full time .
we split washing the dishes like this i cook he cleans and vice versa .
he comes home and starts doing them shortly after .
i come into the kitchen see he 's still working on them and decide to dry the cutlery and put it away .
i walk away and he gets upset because i 'm not drying the rest of the dishes .
he says well why would n't you finish the rest ?
it makes no sense to dry a few things and then walk away . ''
i 'm a little confused why this is such a big deal .
he does n't help me when i do the dishes .
it 's our anniversary today and i want to fix this but he does n't want to talk .
should i let it slide or force him to talk about it ?
tl dr boyfriend upset cause i helped dry dishes for a minute and walked away when it was his turn to do them .
claims it 's silly to dry a few and not finish them for him and is now ignoring me .
i 'm sorry if this has been discussed many times before .
but i ca n't help but notice that toriyama has simply reduced the character of goku to the point being a man-child who is merely obsessed with getting stronger .
if we look at the z era heck even the dragonball era goku was simply wiser '' .
he was not selfish in only wanting to battle stronger opponents .
it is true that he was trying to win against piccolo as if it were a tournament for victory '' he took pride on that victory after getting blasted by piccolo through his chest .
but it was also clear that it was not his obsession .
he was on a mission from kami to prevent piccolo from returning to dominate the world .
he was again on a mission to save his friends and child .
he cared about his friends to the point of becoming super saiyan upon krillin 's death .
he avenged yamcha 's chaotzu 's and tien 's death when he battled nappa .
during the buu saga and even cell he made sure to prepare the next generation to be the earth 's protectors .
this is something he realized after witnessing the limit of his own power and the potential of the next generation in gohan during the cell saga .
this is also why he did n't defeat fat buu when he could actually do it in super saiyan 3 .
he explicitly stated that he wanted to leave the next generation to protect the world a theme he again touched when he decided to train uub out of his own initiatives .
but above all goku in the z era was simply merciful .
he did n't simply let vegeta live just so that he could battle him one day .
he was being merciful to one who could no longer fight .
this is the same mercy he showed to frieza and even to reecome and captain ginyu on namek .
even when he tried to kill buu he wished that he be reincarnated again .
even the manga changed the reason for his training uub from one of his own concern and goodwill to being a reccomendation of dende .
goku in super was his early dragonball era persona prior to his training with master roshi a child who is not concerned with anything but becoming stronger .
he has lost the protectice care for the world he has saved many times .
he becomes a flat 2-dimentional character without any complexity nor display of seriousness .
in the z era he was funny when the situation allowed him .
with android 16 he was trying to be friendly with the old kai he negotiated a deal on nude pictures e walss also funny when he lost the earring when facing super buu .
perhaps the situation did n't demand him perhaps the the level of threat was so low but even in the zamasu saga he did n't display any of the other traits above .
no mercy no wisdom no care for the world .
the z era goku would have been very concerned with the state of the world at the threat of zamasu .
he would be excited to battle him yes but he would also make more serious preparation to ensure that zamasu was eliminated .
this is not only bad writing it was an insult to goku 's character .
goku was indeed reckless but even in his recklessness for example in pitting gohan against cell he knew he was right .
goku now simply becomes a joke character who does n't care about his own kid .
in the z era it was merely hinted at .
goku was an interesting and lovable character because he was somewhat a caring person for the world especially who was wise in some aspects and who knew mercy and evil when he sees one .
i am very disappointed in his character development '' .

i am looking for a fellow writer that at least enjoys writing from the submissive point of view .
i am posting a vague title like this so that maybe we can chat a little and see if we have some interests that match up .
i am not dead set on any one prompt and i do n't want the title of one prompt to convince someone to pass on by .
i have various interests that can make a story very dirty or very romantic .
just because a story has romance in it does not mean it ca n't be kinky and fun as well .
most of the stories that i prefer to write have to do with d/s themes .
normally i like the ddlg themes but i am not committed to them .
my main goal with this post is to convince at least one of us to have a chat about our likes/dislikes in and out of the kinks world .
pictures for character ideas are always nice but i also enjoy detailed descriptions as well .
if this post interests you or maybe there is a prompt you already have in mind that you want to try and i strike you as a good partner ... please send me a message .
i am always looking forward to writing with new people ! !
if it does n't interest you ... have a great day anyways !

you can read the responses directly from this link https www.reddit.com/r/raiblocks/comments/7ko5l7/colin_lemahieu_founder_and_lead_developer_of
both in developing areas itself and in terms of integration ?
these basically need to happen in a sequence because each item is n't useful unless the previous one is complete .
do you have any plans to have your source code peer reviewed ?
by peer review i mean sending your source code down to mit for testing and review .
where do you see raiblocks 5-10 years from now ?
for instance do you envision people using a raiblocks mobile phone app to transfer value between each other or buy stuff at the store ?
we definitely need peer and code reviews and we 're open to anyone doing this .
we have ideas for people in universities that want to analyze the whitepaper or code so we 'll see what comes of that .
in my opinion code security guarantees can only be given with eyes time and we need both .
i 'd like to see raiblocks adopted as an internet rfc and basically become an ubiquitous background technology like http .
i think you 're probably right and a mobile app would be the most user-friendly way to do this so people do n't need to carry around extra cards in their wallet etc .
is there a list of the team readily available ?
are there firm plans to expand and if so in which directions ?
the roadmap indicated a website redesign scheduled for november 2017 .
we have about 12 people in the core team about half are code and half are business developers .
on the redesigned website we 're going to include bios for sure no one in our team is anonymous .
i think we have pretty good coverage of what we need right now we could always use more people capable of contributing to the core code .
the website design is well underway we wanted to streamline and add some more things to it so it took longer than originally estimated .
it 'll looking like after the new year we 'll have it ready .
would you ever consider renaming the coin to simply rai '' or any other simplified form other than raiblocks ?
what marketing strategy do you think will push xrb forward from now on as a fully working product .
instant and free the green coin it just works '' coin etc ?
regarding security is quantum-proofing '' a big concern at the moment and how do you guys plan to approach this when the time comes .
and how possible would it be for bad actors to successfully implement a 51 attack .
yea there are a few difficulties people have pointed out with our name .
people do n't know if it 's ray '' or rye '' .
blocks '' does n't have a meaning to a lot of people and the name reference might be too esoteric to be meaningful .
i 'm not prideful so i 'm not stuck on a particular name we 'll take a look at what our marketing and business developers say peoples ' impressions are and if they have any naming recommendations .
our marketing strategy is to focus on complete simplicity .
instant and free resonates with enthusiasts and mass adoption will only come when using xrb is absolutely the same experience as using a banking or other payment app .
people are n't going to tolerate jargon or confusing workflows when sending or receiving payments .
quantum computing is going to be an amazing leap for humanity but it 's also going to cause a lot of flux in cryptography .
the plan i see is the similar to what i did in selecting the cryptographic algorithms we 're using right now look for leaders in academia and industry that have proven implementations and use those as they recommend migration based on computing capability .
quantum vulnerabilities can be an issue in the future but a vulnerable implementation would be an issue right now .
hi colin lately xrb has been getting frequently compared to and contrasted with iota .
i was hoping that you could give us your thoughts on the differences between the two and what your general vision for the future of raiblocks is .
it 's flattering to be compared to iota they have a very talented team building ambitious technology .
when looking at design goals i think one thing we 're not attempting to approach is transferring a data payload we 're only looking to be a transfer of value .
there are lots of ideas and technology to be developed in the cryptocurrency space and i want raiblocks to solve one section of that industry the transfer of value .
i think the best success would be if raiblocks was adopted as the global standard for this and crypto efforts could move to non-value-transfer use-cases .
do you see xrb becoming the new payment method for commerce .
do you have plans for combating the hodl mentality so this currency can actually be used in the future of buying and selling ?
being a direct transactional payment method is our goal and we 're trying to build software that 's accessible to everyone to make that happen .
i see holding as a speculative tactic anticipating future increases and you 're right it 's not in line with day-to-day transactions .
i think as market cap levels off to a more consistent value the reason for holding and speculating goes away and people can instead focus on using it as a value exchange .
are you planning to expand the raiblocks team over the next 12 months ?
if so what types of positions are you hoping to fill ?
right now we have about 12 people half core and half business developers .
i think this count is good for working on what we 're doing right now which is getting wallets and exchanges worked on .
ideally people outside our team will start developing technology around xrb taking advantage of the network effect to build more technology faster than we could internally .
that being said we 're going to look in a few months to see if there 's anything out there people are n't developing that should be and we 'll see what people we need to make it happen .
at what point did you make the decision to make raiblocks your full time job ?
it was after the week where the core team met here in austin to brainstorm our next steps .
i saw how much enthusiasm there was from crypto-veterans with having a working system capable of being scaled up to what 's needed for massive adoption and it seemed the risk needed to be taken .
it was hard decision to make working in the crypto and finance is rough and i like using my leisure time to work on inventions .
of all the projects ideas i have this one seemed to have a high chance of success and the benefits of having a working decentralized currency would be huge .
hi colin what prevents great cryptos like xrb from being listed on bigger exchanges ?
it 's good to understand where the biggest headaches for exchanges lie support tickets operations and development .
if a technology is different from what they already have that takes development time .
if the software is new and not widely run that 's potential operations time to fix it which results in support tickets and community backlash .
adding bitcoin clones or ethereum ico coins is easy because they do n't have these associated risks or costs .
what can the average raiblocks-fan do to help xrb getting adopted growing expanding ?
i think the best thing an average fan could do is word of mouth and telling people about raiblocks .
more people being aware of it means there 's the possibility someone who 's never heard of it before would be interested in contributing as a vendor developer exchange etc .
good advertising or marketing will never be able to reach everyone as well as someone reaching out within their own network .
it comes from https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rai_stones lots of people do n't know the answer though
are you looking at incorperating a datamarket like iota in the future ?
given the speed of the network a data exchange for highly accurate sensors could be a game changer .
further more are there any plans to increase the dev team in the future ?
i read on the faq you 'd like raiblocks to be somewhat of a protocol which is a huge ambition .
a dev from say the mozilla foundation or other could further cement this ambitious project .
transmitting data payloads is something we probably wo n't pursue .
the concern is adding more features like this could cause us to make decisions that compromise the primary focus points of low-cost and speed for transferring value .
we can add people to the dev team though i think we 'll get the most traction by teaching teams in these other organization how to use raiblocks so they can be the experts on the subject in their companies .
does the actual raiblocks version require each node in the network must be aware of all transactions as they occur '' part ?
this was in the old white paper and is asked here
if a node wants to independently know the balances of all accounts in the system it must at a minimum have storage to hold accounts and all their balances .
in order to know all balances it must either listen to transactions as they 're happening or bootstrap from someone else to catch up as what happens on startup .
some people will do it because it is cheap as fuck as i read an raspberry pie can run it .
but i think not many people will do it .
how important are the nodes in terms of further scaling ?
on which network conditions where the 7000 transactions met ?
what happens if the transactions per day tenfolds but the nodes do n't ?
how much better will rai scale if someone sets up lets say 100 nodes with awesome hardware and network ?
how many nodes could be enough for visa level scaling ?
which further improvements can be made for rai if there needs to be other improvements than setting up new nodes ?
are there other concepts like 2nd layer solutions planned ?
but since there a also large attacks on high cap coins on which people invest millions of to congest a network..is it possible that the rai network will be unusable for several days because of this ?
i think the out-of-protocol incentives to running a node are under-referenced yet i see them as the primary driving factor for participating as a whole .
node rewards come at the expense of other network participants and in this closed loop the incentives are n't enough to keep a cryptocurrency alive .
long-term there needs to be a system-level comparative advantage to what people are already using for a transfer of value .
if someone is using xrb and it saves them hundreds or thousands of dollars per month in fees and customer irritation in delayed payments they have a direct monetary incentive to using xrb and a monetary incentive in the health of the system .
2 the 7k tps was a profile how fast commodity hardware could eat transactions .
all of the real-world limits are going to be something hardware related either bandwidth io or cpu .
3 the scaling is more related to the hardware the nodes are using rather than the node count .
if there was 10x increase in transactions it would use 10x the bandwidth and io as nodes observe transactions happening .
4 if someone made 100 representative nodes the network would be far more decentralized though the tx throughput would be unchanged since that 's a per-node requirement .
5 scaling to visa will have high bandwidth and io requirements on representatives associated with doing 10k iops .
datacenter and business class hardware will have to be enough to handle the load .
6 second layer solutions are always an option and i think a lot of people will use them for fraud protection and insurance .
our primary focus is to make the 1st layer as efficient and high speed as possible so a 2nd layer is n't needed for daily transactions .
7 defending against network attacks will be an ongoing thing people like breaking the network for lulz or monetary gain i.e .
if there are attacks we have n't defended against or considered it 'll be a matter of getting capable people to fix issues .
i 'm open to it people get confused on ray/rye pronunciation not the greatest first impression .
as far as timing i think marketing works best after a more user friendly wallet and integration in to more exchanges otherwise we 're sending traffic to something people ca n't use .
we 're going to start by focusing on the initial adopters which will likely be enthusiasts and going forward work on the next set of users that are n't enthusiasts but want to drive savings for their business through lower payment processing costs .
could this be a case with testing the scalability of raiblocks as well and in reality we would n't come close to 7000tx/s ?
i think he 's definitely right a lot of the tps numbers are synthetic benchmarks usually on one system .
the biggest thing hindering tps are protocol-specific limits like hard caps or high contention design .
the next biggest thing will be bandwidth and then disk io .
some of these limits can be improved by profiling and fixing code instead of actual limits in the hardware .
we want to get better real world numbers but our general opinion is that the raiblocks protocol is going to be limited by hardware rather than design .
are you planning to add a fiat gateway to the main website and mobile wallet ?
if we can make it happen for sure that seems like a very user-focused feature people would want .
the difficulty at least in the us is the money-transmitter licenses which are hard to obtain .
more than likely if this functionality was added it 'd be a partnership with an established financial company that has procedures in place to operate within countries ' regulations .
i saw a post on r/iota that claims that their quantum resistance is a main benefit over raiblocks .
explain any plans you have to let xrb persevere through upcoming quatum revolution ?
i think everyone with cryptography in their programs is keeping an eye on quantum cryptography because we 're all in the same boat .
i do n't have cryptanalysis credentials so i did n't feel comfortable building an implementation and instead chose to use one off-the-shelf from someone with assuring credentials .
there are some big companies that have made small mistakes that blow up the usefulness of the entire algorithm it 's incredibly easy to do .
hello colin is any security audit to the source code planned ?
we do n't have one contracted though both internally and externally this is an important thing people want completed .
do you have plans to radically change the interface of the desktop wallet and to develop a universal cross-platform clean and simple ux design for the wallet ?
this will be huge for mass adoption in my humble opinion
i completely agree we do plan on completely redoing the desktop wallet both from a ux standpoint and maintainability so ui code does n't need to be in c .
this could also remove out dependency on qt which is the least permissive license in the code right now .
it seems like raiblocks is aiming to be a true currency with it 's lacking of transaction fees and fast confirmation times which is great !
if raiblocks can add some kind of support for privacy then i think it got the whole picture figured out in terms of being digital cash '' .
do you currently have any plans to implement privacy features into raiblocks ?
if raiblocks is unable to do this it will still be a straight improvement over things like ltc which are currently being used as currency but i do n't think it will be able to become the cryptocurrency without privacy features .
i love the concept of privacy in the network and it 's a hard thing to do right .
any solution used would need to be compatible with our balance-weighted-voting method which means at least we 'd have to know how much weight a representative has even if we 're hiding actual account balances .
to be fully anonymous it would have to be hide accounts amounts endpoints and also timing information with advanced network analysis the timing is the hardest thing to hide .
hopefully some day we can figure out an efficient privacy solution though the immediate problem we can solve is making a transactional cryptocurrency so we 're focusing on that .
could you provide an analysis on the flaws of raiblocks ?
is it in any way shape or form at a disadvantage compared to a blockchain based ledger like bitcoin ?
there has to be drawbacks but i have n't found any .
do you plan on expanding the dev team and establishing a foundation ?
also how much money is in the development pool ?
one drawback is to handle is our chain-per-account model and asynchronous updates it takes more code and design .
this means instead of one top-block hash for everything there 's one for each account .
this gives us the power of wait-free asynchronous transactions at the cost of simplicity .
after we finish up things like the wallet website and exchange integration we 'll be looking at seeing what dev resources we need to build tech if no one else is already working on a particular thing .
we have about 6 million xrb right now so we 've made the existing dev funds go a long way .
if something expensive to build came along and dev funds would n't cut it we could look at some sort of external funding .
how big of a problem is pow for exchanges and what are potential solutions ?
considering how much exchanges stand to make through commission i do n't see the cost as a barrier it 's just an abnormal technology request compared to other cryptocurrencies .
we 're working on providing a service exchanges can use in the interim until they set up their own infrastructure to generate the work .
other options are containers people can use on cloud services to get the infrastructure they need until they want to invest in their own .
it 's my understanding that since everything works asynchronously in the case of double spending there is a chance a merchant would receive the block that would be later invalidated and have it shown in it 's wallet even if a little later 1 minute ?
the amount would correct when the delegates vote that block invalid .
maybe tag the transactions in the wallet as confirming '' and then confirmed '' after that minute ?
is there actually any certain way for a wallet to know in a deterministic/programable way at what moment a transaction is 100 legit ?
for example if the delegates are dos'ed i guess that minute could be much longer .
i know this is an improbable case but still ...
yea you 're hitting a good point the consensus algorithm in the node is designed to wait for the incoming transaction to settle before accepting it in to the local chain for the exact reason you listed if their transaction were to be rolled back the local account would be rolled back as well .
we can trend the current weight of all representatives that are online and voting and make sure we have 50 of the vote weight accounted for before considering it settled .
hey colin will you eventually have support for a trezor or other hard wallet ?
yea we 'll definitely work with companies like trezor that are interested in being a hardware wallet for xrb .
it 's just a matter of making sure they support the signing algorithms and integrating with their api .
recently started watching this with my girlfriend and while at first i was n't sure about it it definitely grew on me .
just looking for a general discussion on the show but i also have a question .
did the creators change the direction of the show after season one ?
at first the show seems like its going to simply focus on anna farris ' character getting sober and dealing with her kids and mom who also is getting sober .
and while the other seasons definitely do have those elements the show grew into a deeper show that deals with addiction suicide child abandonment and other serious issues .
the show also seems to rotate cast members in and out with most dealing with the support group some dealing with the children some dealing with the protagonist 's ex-husband and so on .
it just feels like the show changed directions from being a simple one-note sitcom to being a much more involved show that 's actually pretty damn good .
i am angery my dad is such an asshole he 's done so many things i 'm just gon na list two
so whenever i get depressed which is all the time now he forces me to go out and do things which just pisses me off and gets me more depressed and i tell him that and he says that 's what helps me but just 10 minutes ago i told him about a friend and he said that 's not my kid you and him are different people like mf what
and then also he 's so fucking passive aggressive all the damn time i wan na fucking die cuz i cant say anything back or he takes away everything for way to fucking long which is stupid idfk that he takes the shot away its that he does so often
i 've been at 20hours of just farming legendary cores .
i 've had everything else but i 've never seen kosmos and i 've never seen her silhouette .
there some stupid thing i have to do to add her to the pool ?
so i 've been tinkering with the idea of crafting a no/super low fantasy post apocalypse setting with a focus on crew mechanics survival and gritty combat .
i was originally going to use the degenesis system however shipping it from germany is incredibly expensive and coriolis happens to be offered physically at my local game store .
while i find the setting super interesting i prefer to craft my own settings .
i was mostly wondering just how possible or wield-y the system is to homebrew and jerry rigging ?
i 've given the genesys and gurps systems a look and while they are great systems they appeal more to engineer style of dms who want to put in much much more work .
in your opinions can coriolis be modified to suit the setting ?
is it 's mechanical system fit for a more gritty realism ?
i am 5'7 '' and weigh about 155 lbs .
i try to eat 1500 calories a day but also started working a full-time job after college .
it seems like every day there is some sort of food being brought into the office that i should n't eat but ca n't stop myself from having just a little and end up eating way more than i should .
while i was close to having a low bf a few months ago i 've fallen off the wagon to a degree since starting work .
how do people with low bf 's construct their diets so that they do n't only eat bland food plain chicken veggies rice without being overcome by temptation ?
or is the best way to just avoid it entirely ?
edit clarifying how much of the unhealthy food i ate
i am looking for a gaming headset that has the best quality microphone .
i have used regular mics before but they just annoy me with positioning and all the adjusting .
i am currently using a hyperx cloud stinger set but am looking to upgrade to a more expensive set with better mic quality .
i plugged the power supply back in to the old mobo which lit up .
it 's an old psu but that should n't be a problem right ?
list anything you 've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem .
i went back to micro center and swapped it out and it 's the same problem .
could be 2 doa which would be shitty luck .
looking for some advice on repairing this tarp if possible .
so far my thoughts have been to wrap with tenacious tape and then sew .
but maybe it would be better to do the reverse ?
one of the things that is pretty noticeable is how the sequel trilogy seems to tiptoe around anything contributed by the prequels .
coruscant arguably the center of civilization in the galaxy has not been mentioned once and the dozens of planets introduced in the past have never been revisited except by the extended universe which is dutifully maintained by the creators of the comics and people like dave filoni .
i think the most noticeable example is the lack of alien species shown in the prequels .
the new trilogy has been pretty in-your-face about practical effects aliens which is cool to point but watching the behind the scenes or noticing that the camera spends just a slightly longer than normal amount of time on the new aliens you really get the sense they are trying to assert that the prequels were awful and we will never mention them again and we will demonstrate this by introducing dozens of new alien species and not one alien from the prequels will show up . ''
that kind of turned into a rant by me but that is just one aspect of the prequel denial .
as a prequels child i feel like this is an entirely different galaxy .
i have n't used it since last wednesday but i tried logging in today and my account is gone .
the app takes me to the login screen which does n't recognize my email anymore and there are only paid options when i try to create a new account.
is it possible to have a free account anymore ?
nevermind apparently the registration screen in the browser still registers your account .
if you do n't take any action when they ask you what kind of payment you want to use you can still log into the app .
hey guys so i 'm kinda sick of my towns burning down .
i have plenty of fire stations and helicopters but the fires still rage on .
so 2 questions ... i had natural disasters but hated it so i unsubscribed or whatever deleted it .
it seems like fires have increased though is it just me ?
also i have seen mods in the workshop to stop or slow down fires but does anyone recommend a reliable one ?
however i found one of my girls pg shacking up in little 's home one morning .
she was getting on top of her hut and jumping to get to him .
we fixed this immediately but i have no clue what went on from 10pm and 5am and made sure to write down the date just in case .
my girls are about 6 months old and sisters .
i 've done some research and know that she could be due in the next couple weeks .
i 'm tapped out on money until next month otherwise i would take her to the vet .
her abdomen is n't squishy '' like her sis and yes we have been very gentle but i 'm concerned .
should i keep her in a cage away from her sister ?
would having her away from her sis make her more anxious ?
she 's still only about 60 trusting of me .
is there any way to tell if she is actually pregnant ?
people can be harsh on this thread so please know this was n't planned but i 'm trying to do all i can for the health of my girl and her possible babies .
dumb question but would putting drops of cbd oil on your tongue rather than underneath it sublingually increase the duration of effect of cbd ?
i need it to last me all day at least 6 hours .
i also heard that ingesting it instead of using it sublingually reduces the amount of cbd that enters you because it goes through the liver first or something ?
for me personally it probably has to be e-pro or sexx laws as they both set the mood for their respective albums .
just put 4.5k in a few hours ago hoping i can at least get something small out of it anything really .
i wo n't receive it for 8 days the waiting is too painful i 'm definitely backing out of this system once it all comes back .
i 'd really like to know if there 's anyone who genuinely believes bch is going to crash sucks or is generally just bad who are n't the ones who got fucked when the buy/selling options for bch messed up and resulted in them losing money .
i do n't plan on pulling anytime soon even once i get it all i 'm not worried about money just worried if i 'm wasting emotions on this .
i am here asking why sounds that are unusual sound so fascinating while tripping i 've tripped many of times and each time i like to listen to songs that are ment for tripping for example i meet this amazing artist named sumthin sumthin who makes music for people under the influence of lsd he took me back stage while i was at his show tripping balls and we talked about acid and the amazing abilities of it and his songs are unbelievable and i can not describe the sounds he has created and developed for some reason while tripping sounds make me visualize certain things that i can not explain .
i visualize these crazy objects and formations from these sounds that i listen to i just want to know why that happens and what do these sounds mean under the influence they like speak to me and i am transported into another reality plus everything is made up of sounds and vibrations are body 's are just vessels for our soul and we are nothing but sounds that escape our body when we talk .
i 'm just rambling on but my last trip really made me wonder i 'm just curious if anyone else understands me .
i 'm okay with non-gui prompts too but i do n't know enough about variables arrays or prompts to be as good as i want to at powershell .
i generally access o365 through ps i 'm getting the boatload of the work and i 'd rather script something that teaches them the variables it 's asking for and then letting them put it in but researching issues generally revolves around the gui .
bit of work on my part but worthwhile for people understanding .
the back end is more powerful than the front end why is n't there a list of things that do what do n't involve the gui ?
the two communicate i can get-wtfever and hit exchange admin and see the same domain federation but nosync .
i 'm okay with things not syncing instantly but i have a problem with the lack of command-sync for the two interfaces especially when logging into each with the same account .
has anyone here found a better solution to this than what i 'm doing ?

my posts are too long for the main thread so here 's a mega post of my thoughts on all scripts in the contest excluding of course the believers .
the good news is none of the scripts are bad !
in the previous contest there were a couple scripts i did not enjoy at all .
the real reward for this contest is feedback from such talented writers !
if you want to comment on my thoughts keep it as a reply below the relevant screenplay discussion .
a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist 2017 was they year i got introduced to iota .
since paradox made it so that ai players can increase development it makes it near impossible to take over the world .
good luck players who are trying to take over the world as ryukyu .
do n't you think that in each age there should be an ae modifier that reduces the ae taken do to the fact that the development of provinces increases with each age ?
by the end of my germany campaign paris had a development of 61 and i could n't get it .
i was trying to illustrate to someone that they 've met edda before and they said they could n't remember .
so i flew to my unending journey book only to realize fire in the gloom has no cut-scenes in the unending journey https i.imgur.com/cuqgfgn.png .
so i had to do the next best thing and find a youtube video https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6xr1xtw9izi t=9m50s for it that did n't have someone voicing over it .
i just ported over my living dex after recovering my nnid and pokemon bank after a 2 year leave from pokemon .
this will of course not only give me that shiny charm i need but set me up for the next generation of pokemon as i had done for myself in oras previously .
but if anyone would like to help with my remainder i 'd be very grateful .
of course after completion of the alolan dex i get my shiny charm .
and i can go back to my roots of competitive breeding without feeling bad about potentially missing out on some lucky shinies with that charm in hand .
as with this being the case i more than welcome any one who is willing to help me out to throw out breeds that they would like .
i could use some projects to get back in to the swing of things .
i 'm experienced in ha ball egg moves 5/6v breeding .
i 'm also capable of hp breeding though of course that adds a level of complexity that greatly increases the time a breed will take .
but for anyone willing to help me i 'm more than willing to return the favor !
so without further ado this is what i need ... yes i save the legendaries for last for catching myself in game to maximize the potential of critical captures to make that grind as least grindy as possible !
volcanion a mythic that had evaded me in my oras days
type null or silvally i have a null already that could be evolved
poipole or naganadel i have a poipole that could be evolved
final note i do have some leftover breeds from previous .
these would include 5v breedjects of totodile swablu and bagon .
i also have some 6vs that i might be able to part with .
though i always hold on to a 6v male and female for all of my breeds so if i only have one i 'd have to rebreed .
still need to complete nightfall with 5 minutes left and someone else who has the rat king quest i think
anyone in the same situation or would like to help ? ?
i 've been through multiple sexual assaults in my life and for the most part i believe they have n't had a debilitating impact on my life besides being jaded as most of them were relatively minor .
however when i orgasm from masturbation memories of being humiliated and bullied by my ex after he raped me always pops into my head .
it 's either that memory and/or the memory of my date 's friend putting his hands down my pants and rubbing my vagina when he thought i was sleeping .
after these memories come up i usually begin crying and feeling disgusting and worthless about myself .
i am wondering if they 're flashbacks or just memories .
the reason i think these may be flashbacks is because i seem to have no control over stopping them once i 've reached climax .
yet it could also be that it accidentally popped into my head once and i am now trying to prevent it from happening again .
it 's like the scenario where someone exclaims do n't think of a pink elephant '' and then you think of a pink elephant .
sometimes i think okay do n't think about it this time '' and then it inevitably happens .
i feel like i 've processed and have thought through both of these situations and if i am able to think about them does that mean that they 're just memories and not flashbacks ?
also these memories do n't pop up when i am having sex with someone and reach climax .
i am able to stay in the moment during those times .
these memories that i 've experienced during masturbation are the only reason i began calling those situations assault though .
if so how have you stopped it from happening ?

disclaimer i am an individual diagnosed with ptsd who experiences panic attacks nightly though the frequency and intensity is starting to lessen as i recover .
although what i experienced is within the realm of mental illness i feel like the implication behind it is something that can be held true for mentally healthy individuals .
i know this is dangerously close to rule 4 but hear me out .
if this does n't fit in the sub just remove it .
background the last month and a half has been bad .
my mind had been plagued with irrational paranoid thoughts leaving me constantly on the edge of having a panic attack .
the levels of anxiety i experience waver but the last month and a half has been the most difficult time i 've weathered not including the actual onset of trauma .
i knew at the time that it was simply something i would have to muddle through in the natural course of healing but unbeknownst to me i was reaching a limit .
the meat it was n't the sensation of pins and needles but i had begun to dissociate .
this is the part that i feel relates to everyone .
i was ascending into a fugue as was diagnosed by my psychiatrist but during the journey something rather disturbing occurred .
i slowly began to lose control of my body .
i felt no sensation coming from my nerves unless i absolutely fought my hardest to focus .
at some point while losing phsyical sensation i began to lose control of my muscular system .
then horrifically i began to disconnect from what i thought was me my thoughts .
whatever makes up my consciousness is not the same mechanism that generates my thoughts .
i was stuck for over an hour drifting in and out of paying attention to what my body was doing and in that time i could hear my own thoughts though i was not the one thinking them .
my brain was running everything like a machine without my consciousness needing me to function .
my body was was in every sense a philisophical zombie .
in between the bouts of nothingness i was forced to watch my body clumsily attempt to eat and drink and form coherent thoughts .
it was like a locked in syndrome but only mentally locked in .
implications after a little over an hour i finally reconnected with my body and realized a few things .
i thought my consciousness was composed of my thoughts feelings attitudes and free will .
but if my consciousness can be independent of those things what is it ?
my brain and body are fully capable of performing basic life functions without me .
although it was very clumsy and struggled it was able to drink from a glass of water and was almost able to successfully eat and chew .
more distressing though is that my thoughts were still being generated without me .
and although most of it was broken bits of sentences it was still coherent to the situation without me being the one to create them .
although i 'm fully integrated back into myself i can not forget what it feels like to exist with no connection to my own body .
i feel like i 've experienced something i was n't meant to as if i broke through some barrier .
i feel like a character from flat land experiencing a new element to reality that i never knew was real before .
fugue dissociation is a documented occurence in the psychology community .
am i being held complacent inside of this organic machine being so ignorant of the nature of reality that i ca n't even tell what 's me and what is n't ?
more importantly how many of us have broken our restraints through stress or upset and are forced to watch our bodies continue on living without any free will or input from us ?
this has been a a bit of a jumbled mess but please look past that and give me your thoughts and theories as to what we are .
please do not reference or worry about my mental health state .
i only mentioned it to give context as to how i reached such a level of anxiety .
i am fine and on a healthy road to recovery .
after writing this all out i 'm not even sure if this fits within this sub .
people post pulls then later get deleted lowkey laughing why bother .
i am curious to hear if there is any information about how the blockchain grows over time for raiblocks .
the only coin that i have found so far that has solved this in a good and safe way seems to be pascal coin .

tonpa has been taking and failing the hunter exam for 35 years in row just because he enjoys crushing rookies .
however tonpa 's 46 years old meaning he first took the exam and survived when he was 10 younger than gon killua and ging .
not only that as others have pointed out tonpa would most likely have met and tried to crush ging due to the former 's eye for strong examinees .
35 years is a long fucking time though and most hunters we 've seen are younger than that or at least not much older .
from this we can assume tonpa 's met just about every important character in this
the examiners menchi buhara and ippo they seem to be in their 20 's as well as satotz he seems to be in his 40 's .
morel and knov assuming they 're both in their 40 's at the very oldest .
shoot knuckel and palm since they 're in their 20 's .
all the zodiacs with the exception of botobai the rest are pretty young assuming none of them are on that bisky shit .
everyone who played greed island most notably genthru since you need to have nen to enter and there were n't any old people playing .
and fucking shalnark who is as far as we know is the only phantom troupe member with a hunter license .
conclusion tonpa is an absolute treasure trove of information about everybody important in the entire hxh universe and the main cast were dumb to not seek him out for help and networking .
so is the green meant to be a field of grass for the dragon to stand on or is it a dragon over a simple 2 colour flag

this year was a remarkable year for me because i completed all me games including our favorite game of all time andromeda and all the da games .
now i 'm half way through inquisition and i 've got a question .

so i know the joy you get from completing da series in a whole meeting your favorite character teamleliana but how will it change if you start at inquisiton ?
so as a kid my brother and i would play wrestling '' with the double bed we 'd take the mattress off and have matches on the living room floor and this was in 2000 or something and we just watched summerslam and it was the coolest thing so we always tried to emulate the hardy boyz .
what about you guys was there bunch of wrestlers that you watched which you wanted to emulate ?

quad is one of a handful of exchanges that you can actually get cad from .
when litecoin was dipping last night making a transaction was next to impossible due to the shear amount of transactions .
nearly every exchange is like this at the moment .
no one was expecting the increase in buyers and sellers in the last month .
i understand having hundreds thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars invested makes someone want it to be rock solid .
even gdax and coinbase are being hammered and degraded .
just relax and give quad some time to catch up .

at the start of legion i made about 5million gold in various markets then stopped making gold .
last week i only had 60k left and i thought it‘s time to make some gold again obviously it‘s going to be harder than before because there‘s more competition and people caught up .
after one week i‘m already at 210‘000 with minimal time investements flipping oblit crafting enchantments and food high pop realm eu .
i analysed which market may issue a profit and just invested 55k of my 60k .
so don‘t be afraid to invest a lot of your gold i think alot of people are afraid to buy mats etc .
but if you have a good plan in some diffrent markets f.e .
30 oblit 30 en 30 food you will almost certainly make a profit .
also don‘t panic sell if the market dips wait for the best time in the week to sell for max prices .

hey chrome why firefox remembers to keep oldskin on youtube and you not ?
i get tired of switching back to old skin on youtube and disable auto-play only to have it all reverted back after i open my next browsing session
ps seriously why we cant reopen closed tab in guest browsing '' or incognito mode '' if the the window in question is still open ?
does n't really takes so much iq to figure it as needed feature while the window/my sessions is still up so we can reopen a closed tab if need it
i picked this match because it was a good opportunity to discuss early game advantage with an early power curve so extremely in radiant favour .
i also picked it because the laning phase had some great examples of just picking teh wrong time to trade in one case seeing the death prophet almost die taking almost entirely creep damage from a double creep wave .
i feel i should have discussed item builds more in this video but for the low mmr coaching series i want to keep the focus short in each video so if theres any death prophet spammers reading this please jump in with your thoughts .
also side note i have included the beta version of an into i 'm working on .
you know the reason of your problems but still can not improve at all .
you suffer from fear of success you are scary of being that guy who get what he wants and have an amazing life .
instead you preferred to be alone in your room with a computer .

i initially enjoyed the city building aspect of the game but there is too much stuff to place and no space to put it .
stuff like this gets overlooked when the updates break the whole game so i 'd be interested to see what else people used to enjoy .
thank you for loving me when i did n't think i could be loved again .
what you do n't know is that i do n't think i can ever get past the in a relationship or just dating moment .
i 'm afraid to get any closer due to my failed marriage and my relationship before that ended in drugs as well as cheating .
i can never get involved in such a way that i get hurt again to that extent .
one day this might be our ultimate deal breaker because you may want more than my heart desires .
you may want to move in and perhaps do the marriage scenario plus more .
you 've already talked about this in a way .
i 'll hold steady on my decision and our commitment may end .
it makes me sad just to think about this possibility .
one year one month and hopefully more to come until the road may be broken hearted or mended with understanding .
mihai incearca sa-l convinga pe gigel ca atitudinea lui este gresita .
mihai isi doreste sa traiasca într-o societate mai buna unde depozitarea caruciorului si a bicicletei pe scara blocului nu e privita cu invidie de catre vecinii cei hoti ci asa cum se intampla in vest este apreciata pentru ingeniozitatea .
mihai isi face datoria voteaza conștiincios partidul verde isi face selfie-uri la proteste si a renuntat acum cativa ani la becurile cu filament in favoarea celor economice .
orice schimbare in bine i se datoreaza cel putin in parte lui mihai .
in caz ca taximetristul este surd sau are casti si reuseste sa-l jefuiasca totusi politia il va trata cu cel mai mare respect pe mihai .
in nici un caz nu va incerca sa tergiveseze cazul deoarece pana si polițiștii pot vedea ce om frumos si bun este mihai .
pe mihai nu-l intereseaza ce are de spus gigel doar gigel e nume de copil probabil ca si intelectul lui gigel e la fel cu al unui copil .
gigel trebuie sa creada orice spune mihai fara a verifica sau macar a pune la indoiala .
you think she will have to send a card to herself when she turns 100 ?
i spent a couple of months diving into android programming because my husband who 's a programmer said i could make good money doing it .
let me preface this by saying i do n't even like my smart phone so i do n't know why i let him talk me into this .
why would i build a hobby much less a career around this ?
but there i was a few months sunk in and i realized 1 i hated it 2 i had no good ideas for apps i wanted to make and 3 i resented putting effort into it because what i wanted to be doing was writing music .
won a tablet at work won a gift at bowling and won a raffle at bowling for 160 cash .
fortunately it 's just the katana this new season .
sorry i kinda got excited and forgot to put it in the summon thread .
should i just delete my post and post it in there ?
oils really need a carrier oil like rose hip before they touch the skin .
but in smb you do n't repeat 20 minutes of content when you die .
as said in a previous comment i do not trust factory lube after the panda fiasco .
the reason the prices are higher this time around is actually justified to me .
molds cost a lot of money and zeal had to pay to develop entirely new molds for this switch .
first of all i would recommend you visit the nubian village and buy yourself some spices and a few gifts from there .
as for snacks there are n't many special snacks i could think of that can sustain a plane trip but definitely consider buying yourself some spices a few statues for friends and key chains .
one tip i would recommend is to always bargain and have egyptian currency with you to avoid getting scammed .
i remember when i visited luxor there was a guy who wanted to sell me a statue for 110 egp but i got it for 35 instead .
so definitely bargain and do n't buy from the first shop you see to get the best price .
if you want good bargaining techniques i would recommend the following
1 go down to 25 of the price so you can gradually go up
2 try to manipulate the seller as much as you can by showing uninterest and anger towards his prices
3 do n't be too harsh on the seller and try to reach a compromise
4 tell him you are buying a lot of stuff to get a better price
5 always try to show you are experienced even if you are n't
6 compare his price to cheaper stores to show that you are not interested so he can accept your offer
7 if all fails pretend like you are leaving the shop and then come back after a while .
as for the wifi thing it really depends on the cruise .
i do n't think my cruise had wifi and i really did n't care because i was out all day .
you should be aware of the reduced price for monument visits if you are a student because then you can get a 50 off .
and you should always guard your stuff to not get robbed and keep in mind the high prices of stuff .
also bring some mid season clothing with you and 1 or 2 tshirts and a few hoodies because it does get cold at night
i would n't recommend swimming in the pool because it is disease infested .
lastly buy your supplies and water cruises do n't offer free water from stores when you are visiting the monuments and always bargain !
til dagbladet forteller 25-åringen som ønsker å forbli anonym at hun aldri oppfattet sms-ene fra giske som krenkende .
det eneste upassende og krenkende jeg har opplevd i denne «saken» er at journalister i sin jakt på drittsaker overkjører meg og fratar meg retten til selv å eie og definere min egen historie forteller hun videre .
det er jo akkurat det du gjør nå er det ikke ?
du er så desperat etter en drittsak at du tolker alt i verste mening slik at du kan hevde deg over andre når du før eller siden kommer til å få rett .
det er vel bare idioter som har levd i en hule de siste 20 årene som ikke forstår at hvor er det fest ? ''
i den gitte konteksten er kode for jeg er hypp på deg skal vi pule ?
det er bra at hun har deg da som er så smart at du kan vite hva som egentlig foregår uten å ha vært der eller kjenne noen av personene involvert !
og det etter jeg har fortalt at jeg ikke har vært utsatt for noe .
spesielt fordi det har ført til at folk som er glad i meg faktisk har trodd at jeg har vært utsatt for noe alvorlig sier kvinnen .
hva sier det om deg at du sprer rykter på internett om andre i en sak som ikke angår deg og som du har null peiling på ?
spesielt når kvinnen har sagt at dette er en ikke-sak og at det har vært en belastning for henne at det har blusset opp ?

i do n't like unetbootin i had trouble with it as well .
i created a boot usb with a ton of linux distro 's using https www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator
give that a try i hope it works better and that you 'll succeed .
i liked that mixer so much better than the kitchenaid we had to replace it with .
i like that the bowl spins so you can just stick a spatula along the side as it turns and you can incorporate ingredients while it 's running .
you make smelly french people jokes confident that the french cabbie does not understand you ?
oooh sorry the route d'albert is closed we have to take the long way around .
you get into a cab with an attitude that can jokingly only be explained as american ?
you get ready to be treated with american predjeduces .
and lets not pretend when i enter a restaurant in new york bring my home attitude to tipping on the table you only tip if the restaurant is either missmanaged enough to not pay their wait staff a living wage or if the waiter does excepotional service and do n't leave a 20 tip i get treated any better .
oh the waiters will get slack jawed talking shit about me and how i do n't know jack shit and how i am the reason they wo n't have food ...
and yet i manage to bring myself to the ideal of looking up the cutoms of the place i visit .
if i go to america i will ask beforehand how much tipping is expected .
i will take it in as part of the local colorit .
i will not assume just because tipping is expected the restaurant is shortly before closing forever i know that in some areas it is expected .
mind you as long as i had a minimum of shit like i gave maybe a quarter shit i never had a bad ide in a taxi i never had bad fast food i never had bad service ... .
most people in the service industry are so calloused and broken that the smallest act of k8indness can make them remember why they became service industry professionals .
if you want a personal tip ask a cabbie where you can eat something good you are starving .
you do n't mean something fancy you mean something good .
fair deal the cabbie will most likely have some restaurant that he has a sort of deal with or that he boosts and gets a percentage for free drinks and you will find a place that is n't overrun by tourists like yourself .
plus if you actually value them as humans surprise most taxi drivers will give a shit .

anyways toronto used to have https www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly ? vgnextoid=0be4970aa08c1410vgnvcm10000071d60f89rcr licensing from 1935-1957
failed because this was an overly complex licensing system in a time when a computer database was unavailable .
i am talking about the simple task of putting a number on a bike and linking it to an owner .
there does not seem to be anything here about how it makes a cyclist responsible if the break the rules of the road .
it 's clear what you are talking about is an entirely different thing to what i am talking about and you are getting on a high horse because you think it 's going to be like a drivers license .
switzerland phased out its vignette stickets in 2012 https de.wikipedia.org/wiki/velovignette
i do n't read this language and i do n't have my babel fish in my ear just now but i know this was simply an insurance sticker not a readable identification number linking the owner of the bike to the bike itself .
once again this does not measure any kind of safety increase .
did you just do a quick google and use the first two links you could find .
i ca n't get you links for poland or the netherlands because those phaseout decisions were in the 60s and pre-ww2 .
so both times before any kind of computer database could be built .
i do own some wesco engineer boots and my girlfriend does live about half a block from a ton of gay bars ... hope i 'm not giving off the wrong signal !
dry soda offers a juniper flavor that i think is pretty good .
it lacks any other flavoring agents so it 's not a true gin stand-in but might be useful as a starting point .
it is carbonated whether that is a benefit or a hindrance depends on what you are trying to make with it .
every time someone talks about the handling being shit the only counter point i see is the old it 's not a sim ... '' just because ots not a sim does n't mean they should have went with a mobile-like handling a la asphalt .
theres no grip and all cars have a lot of understeer to compensate the drift you do every time you turn .
seeing that kusyom beck f132 drifting like its nothing is depressing .
all i wanted was a handling like pro street that was n't a sim but it was believable enough and challenging .
you should write 39 of the time '' and send it back to them

no problem keep on asking questions if you do n't know the answer !

it can be easier to sneak in more expensive ingredients if you tell the higher ups that it 's the only kosher option .

if you have 4 shamans that are competent you a huge advantage .
i really do n't need to hear all the people exclaiming '' i beat shamans all the time '' .
the amount of tools in her kit is very overwhelming .
two is a little much but three gets to be too much .
fighting three shamans has a very low low low chance of success .
biggest problems with her kit is range throw distance head butt shove confirm after throw and head butt wall splat .
fighting against this warrior is the biggest fun zapper .
i think there is a problem when a team gets wrecked by shamans then goes back to lobby and picks shamans and then wins .
we were getting to a good spot with balance and then this character came out .
i 'm not sure why they did not play test her but it 's apparent that it was not a priority .
why give this character a majority of the tools from the roster of fighters ?
when i play this game i try to understand the things they do but i just ca n't .
i wanted a street legal dirtbike first but cb 's are so simple and beautiful .

if i were just some dude off the street and purchased the current build pc 1.0 i think i would be pretty happy with how the game looks/feels .
they should just be extremely rare as an exceptional novelty people appreciate as a change of pace .
simple easy solution they were once so people never complained or abandoned matches .
i liked the old style a bit but i can see how it would bug some people .
not sure why everyone 's downvoting you since an option is all you asked for .
maybe the viewership would have been the same with monte there maybe it would have been higher .
no single thing is going to sink the broadcast .
many factors that go into whether a viewer decides to tune in or not casters hosts players and teams the venue tournament format game meta etc .
get enough of these right and people will watch get them wrong and you erode people 's satisfaction with your product .
in a world where there are competing broadcasts optimisation of as many factors as possible will become more important .
loyalty will be huge and the monte/doa fanbase has already proven itself loyal across game titles .
i think monte stimulated a lot of community engagement outside the actual broadcast too .
at ogn he was kind of a gatekeeper of esports .
the first experience of many esports fans was from the starcraft 2 era which transitioned later to league .
on top of that summoning insight was the most watched league talk/analysis show outside of anything riot produced .
he has a large personal following which further extends his reach .
he was even an ex coach and team owner nobody else had his unique experience and broad perspective on league .
there 's a lot of intangible factors at play but i think monte is easily worth every penny in terms of what he has to offer a broadcast .
i did all the corrections in camera raw in photoshop to bring back the clarity and vibrance you were missing .

i 'll judge the ending same way regardless of who writes it .
but within the logic of the show the ending is n't bad by any means .
the point is the show clearly was n't about mystery or action or plot twists so expecting rat to take on the taisen organisation or some other super-shocking twist was n't on the table .
it just was n't going to happen and people said this again and again .
why expect the show to suddenly change its tune when it hit the last episode ?
best pick right there if you do n't have it imo .
boost on armor is always preferrable and the unique attached to it is n't total trash .

assumptions you view yourself as 7-8 on the attractive scale get a good amount of attention by your preferred gender s do not have a lot of performance pressure because of financial security likely provided to you by others .
have you just recently started taking it and feel that adderall is n't doing what you expected it would do ?
it could be an outlet of self-validation because your current means assessing your own self-worth is tied to your physical appearance .
you need to be reassured and make yourself feel like your asset is still valuable .
it 's like checking inventory '' to make sure you still have a product to sell .
your sense of pride and conceited behavior may be compensating for a fear that you 're not successful probably in other ways that have a larger and more long-term benefit like skills or academics or professional accomplishments .
this is an asset you know has a depreciating value and a time limit .
an expression of insecurity for the future by obsessing over a temporary state that has no deep meaning ?
possibly even an evasive behavior if you 're doing this as a distraction when you plan to study if you 're not getting the grades you expect .
i could also totally be wrong i do n't know h/i personality types too well .
if i 'm on track so far then i have a lot of other ideas .

it stays the same until that player gets a new upgrade .
so wagner 's club wo n't become bayern unless he gets a new special card .
new shiny toy that people want they might really be searching for an excuse to upgrade and when a replacement comes up they might not be satisfied with their current phone 's performance .
owners of last years model or people who have n't upgraded or someone owning an iphone 4 ?
i 'd bet searches for existing problems increase around the time any new product is close to release .
ca n't just look at it from one angle .
it might be the right angle it might not .
nothing in this act shall prohibit a non-resident from transporting a concealed firearm within his or her vehicle in illinois if the concealed firearm remains within his or her vehicle and the non-resident
1 is not prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm under federal law
2 is eligible to carry a firearm in public under the laws of his or her state or territory of residence as evidenced by the possession of a concealed carry license or permit issued by his or her state of residence if applicable and
3 is not in possession of a license under this act .
if the non-resident leaves his or her vehicle unattended he or she shall store the firearm within a locked vehicle or locked container within the vehicle in accordance with subsection b of section 65 of this act .
that 's a pretty big thing to lie about .
it certainly puts a different spin on the 'poor pitiful jen who ca n't have a baby ' angle the tabloids seem to love to run with .
if the market cap is 526m with 99m bnb circulating and binance eventually burns 89m bnb .

they are leaving in the lobby though before the match even starts .
also leaving in pubg and ow is very different as there is no downsides to a player leaving in pubg other than less action .
for many the fog is unplayable because of bad frames and rain is never played by me or my friends because the sound makes us insane .
they have stated they will add a better solotion where you can choose which map you want etc until then i 'll leave if i 'm not happy .
and also 'both ways ' regardless of what colour the light happens to be .
it seems like they did n't care to squash any of the bugs

determine the market as a whole for the company you 're investing in .
look for internal forecasts within the report check for dividends too .
fit is a passing fancy and although they have spent majority of their earnings in r d this past year they will need an innovative miracle to consider it a good semi-long term investment .
i suggest tossing 100 at whatever stocks you 'd like after researching your choices this will help you become attuned to the process .
a good analysis should hopefully should not have you admitting you were wrong .
sometimes when the market reacts in a knee jerk fashion i hold strong i trust my insights .
spend lots of time reading financial reports and learn about accounting .
good work out regimen and diet plan provided by a trained and professional coach .
dude is natty and he is far from a monster '' .
look at any high school football player or wrestler and you will see similar physiques .
i mean do any of you even try to deduce shit or do you just go 'he has muscles .
coinbase for example so i can get eth to binance to buy tron missed the train already to trying to catch the next one
what happens now that it 's set to private ?
is everyone locked out or is it still available to it 's members if so how do you become a member ?

challenger 2 although that 's largely based on it being a british military registration number .
my parents ' rule was that friends/family did n't knock .
they come in and put on a pot of coffee .
even though i play a lot i ca n't always finish the chapters this season while before i had completed all but at least the reward is n't as great but i doubt someone that plays more casually will manage .
the power up at least is easy to exploit as oz vs bots but still annoying .
if they are n't painful she might not care how they look .
a lot of people put surgery off for a myriad of reasons .
without any communication from their side apart the ridiculous status page saying as of yesterday that it might take up to 5 days .
honestly i doubt they are conning us but i think their customer service is abysmal..
in any other business they would be gone since a long time .
it would be so easy to send out an email to all affected users and tell them what the status is..
i will not be using coinbase anymore in the future..
shayna is solid unit in whatever you want to do but currently i 'd still prioritize higher defensive power .
shayna 's full potential comes through her leader skill so the more water you use the better .
in def i find full one element teams the easiest to counter so i 'd put her aside for that and spread it to multiple elements .
if you did n't have selena i 'd definitely throw shayna in there .
i got my copy of kiwami on black friday at best buy for around the same price .
this image was taken on an airport when i was returning home after a very hectic semester of college .
as soon as i reached the airport i felt a sigh of relief which made me feel great .
therefore i took out my oneplus 5t to test its camera as i did n't have any time earlier because of my schedule .
going home to meet my family after a long time is already very exciting .
i will miss my friends for a long time but who cares when you get affection from your family leaving the shitty mess food for some time is the best thing that could happen to a hostelite .
also i left 2hrs early to share a cab with one of the hottest girl of my college but she sat in front seat put on earphones and i could n't help buy laugh at my fate .
someone took my stuff once and then built a fort 5-6 stories high .
i may have edited the tile out from under him and he may have died ...
i felt a little bad but that was my purple rocket launcher !
how about getting rid of the idea that just because a person leaves islam it does n't automatically make them an atheist .
thanks man i 'm just not in the mood tonight and i have a short temper currently .
i 'm sure poopy-little-slut is cool with it cool with most stuff .
in particular at base he can take a hit from fomortiis and with a speedwing and garm he does n't get doubled by fomortiis .

if they now come and say peeps we dont support ios anymore '' i will laugh .
yes like the world they accidentally went to one time in bad guys '' iirc
so many people were upset about canning the eu but the fact was it was soooo overburdened with many smaller works contradicting one thing or another .
it would have been impossible to write an original sequel trilogy apart from the eu .
there are many good things from it many people still personally believe is canon and thats fine but for the sake of official storytelling they had to do it .
i 'd bet they did n't expect they 'd be in this quandry .
except for performance in more than 10 inches of snow and a lack of air conditioning these are excellent vehicles .
more fun facts some of the later models were built on the ford ranger frame .
can you tell me what should i do if i want to minor in cs ?
i have registered cs 159 for spring 2018 and i noticed in the course description that one can not get credits from both cs159 and 180 while school of ece does not accept 180 as a substitute .
or can i just take it even though the credits exceed 18 hours for i wo n't get credits anyway .
do you know what we could do with that ?
it does n't matter if it 's in your hand or in your debit card you still have it and need it to purchase things .
this is n't the same thing as what is referred to in revelation .
do n't get caught up in the hand part of it .
idk why jeff goldblum popped in my head but there it is
ooo ahhh and then there 's test bitting and running .
i have had this issue quite a bit since i use maya mostly as well .
while i have not gotten a consistent fix for maya sometimes i make sure to change the scale after the model is imported using the window preferences or use 3d builder built into windows 10 to fix the scaling .
i also tend to use the stl acii format rather than 3mf .
however you are absolutely right that you can scale it in the slicer no problem .
i would recommend putting the model into your slicer first and seeing if your recommend scaling factor works properly .
also some slicers use different scaling units as well which can be confusing .
kinda funny that both times this happened it was against hutton .
but i figured everyone would just have an epiphany .
i play 4-1-2-1-2 2 ingame with cr7 and alessandrini up front and rui cam

pointing out that there 's no need to hate on him for telling his wins and hours ?
what 's going on to the left in the background near the end of the gif ?
the ranks are a vary vague system to go by .
you will alot of koreans and japanese have hit the blue ranks but that might more to do with how much more players are playing in there region .
more players means wider distribution and more points available to reach higher ranks .
this insider trading on the biggest bitcoin exchange is fine is whats hurting crypto imho we 're trying to get away from corrupt insitutions .
the minute han was killed in ep vii i just felt weird about this franchise going forward with anything 'legacy . '
i know having the familiar characters return for this new trilogy is a huge ticket seller for disney but the ending of rotj was so happy-ending-like that to see all my childhood favorites fall on hard times and even die horrible deaths felt depressing .
i 'm sure they could have started a new universe and still sold a shitake-ton of tix .
having the old characters return was only going to upset people no matter the direction ...
maybe you can make a kit of some nice highlighters pens different colors post-it notes and other things to help with his bible studying .
there 's even page tabs for each book of the bible so that he can flip right to one of the books instead of searching through pages i found some at barnes and noble .
being a bible thumper myself i got ta say i love orderly notes and the aforementioned supplies really help .
if he 's really a bible nerd maybe a copy of strong 's concordance .
that 's a book of every hebrew word used in the old testament and every greek word used in the new testament and their translations according to meaning and context .
scholars use this to ensure they have the correct understanding of the use of any word in scripture to make sure they do n't misinterpret anything .
for the cold weather in case of snow perhaps a nice retractable shovel to keep in his car just in case you can probably find one in a military surplus store or maybe some nice gloves .
that 's all the ideas i got i hope this helps !
i got a sky blue hexphase and a decryptor .
that 's a shitty thing to do but you and your brother are n't entitled to a free college education .
in fact having to pay for it yourself and/or having to work a shitty job will make you appreciate the education much more .
sure but we are not saying that we do n't deserve to be called a culture because of it .
cbs is going to get a lot of hate mail about this reunion .
why does this look like an old before the 🅱️an r/dankmemes post ... 🅱️etard
slott also wrote shattered dimensions and that game was pretty good .
i ca n't stand the majority of slott 's run on asm and nobody 's happier than i am to see him go but it 's not fair to act as if everything he touches is shit .
create a layer for each button and have it so when you hold one of those two buttons it switches to that new layer where the other button triggers the keyboard key .
action layer 1 only changes the start button to f5 and action layer 2 only changes the back button to f5 .
on the default layer go to the back button and press y to enable multi-button and select the layer change button .
do the same for the start button and layer 2 .
it 's fun for now but if lonzo does n't become a star then it 's gon na fade quickly .
after awhile it 's just a gimmick if all there 's left is lavar 's personality .
i just do n't see the investment if lonzo does n't make it big and even if he does cuban is already in the business of making money off nba players .
because when they are n't in uniform you do n't know they 're soldiers .
he seems to have flown off the deep end just a few days ago arguing with ari cohn .
i think policy-wise we need someone other than paul ryan .
i 'm never ever going to invest more than i 'd be sad to lose .
it 's far easier to perform unemotionally in the market if you wo n't miss it and therefore you 'll perform much better .
difference is women/feminists who say they dont need no man they are basically lying to themselves by a false sense of pride and bitterness coming from a feeling of inadequacy .
while saying men dont need women for anything other than sex and reproduction is a fact sex is technically not a need in itself other than to procreate but soon we will have artificial wombs and then we really dont need them for anything but women will still need men for resources and protection .
clams please sent you pm yday not sure if worked thank you
so glad for that 2 seconds we talked to lauren before another commercial .
could you imagine if journalism without journalists sensationalizing everything ?
your username reminds me of a recent convo i had with my anatomy teacher who used to work for monsanto .
i asked him if monsanto really was an evil corporation .
he told me my homework for the night was to watch the movie soylent green and left it at that .
i 've had the mavic pro for about 2 weeks and about 20 flights so far .
but very experienced it 's my 5th drone have had a phantom 3 pro for 2 years
i 've run only the 1.04.0100 firmware and have had no real issues .
i have had the app crash in two situations running on a samsung s7 active with latest os updates .
i 've made the following changes and it seems to run clean now .
one crash happened just after an unrelated app updated over wifi because i was in my back yard .
i got the message that something successfully updated while i had the drone in the air then the app crashed .
this frees max memory and keeps other apps from interfering .
3 turn off the video caching on the phone .
this seems to be a biggie and i 've heard others report needing to do this .
the app would crash multiple times per flight until i got that figured out
4 make sure you run the dji go 4 app .
i 'm told the original dji go app will work with the mavic pro but can be unstable .
i would n't have a concern updating the firmware .
stay close to the ground in an open area while you learn how to fly .
and if it ever gets flaky or the app crashes get the app back up it will automatically reconnect and get the drone back and safely on the ground and then try to figure out what 's going on .
a lot of the how i lost my drone '' videos start with something acting kind of weird with the craft before it goes bonkers .
many times just abandoning the flight early and getting the aircraft home is the right answer .
tfa after the return of the jedi i bet some crazy awesome stuff happens with the force !
tfa episode iv redux with no jedi and the empire is in control again for no reason .
tlj okay well we did n't get any new cool force stuff ... but something cool has to happen with the force in the last jedi right ?
tlj oh come on they 're killing all the old characters just to sell penguin plushies at disney .

not developed yet but my lot backs up to a tract of farm land along northshore and i 'm dreading the day i see a sign go up .
from what i understand there 's two neighboring farms that are related and i should be safe as long as one or the other family member is still around .
a lot of apartments but mostly families so it 's pretty quiet and very safe .
walking distance to the danforth about 10-15 minutes at a brisk pace and there 's a lot of stores and restaurants nearby .
there are also quite a few apartments along that stretch of the danforth or broadview ave which would be closer to the subway and stores but you might find them a bit pricier .
shoot him with an arrow to halt the regen use stasis on an iceblock and knock it back at him .
for being a rivalry game '' it felt like a real one .
i did also but it was best for both sides to go their separate ways
well the bitcoin client that existed before the 1mb block cap still works with bch but not btc .
they the republican party in this instance has shown time and time again that they are well equiped in building financial plans that look good in the short term but then hurt us after about ... 4 years-8 years .
for which they then like to blame the pain on the person who just came into office when it 's not a republican .
they 've been using this same tactic time and time again .
it 's a super tragic and illegal activity to leave people locked in a room they decided to lock themselves in .
it 's also super illegal for them to not let the cops come help them out .
it 's likely why the cops showed up anyway .
just a simple welfare call to see if people were tragically locking themselves in bathrooms .
can you answer my question now or do you just want to talk smart ?
same thing here getting ready to start my second bottle !
but i also remember both old and new anime having characters with 1.5m long legs so 2 lalas would make up 1 of those anime legs .

so i just watched the movie and what in the actual fuck ?
dialogue was horrendous in about 70 of it a lot of the scenes with humor felt forced and completely out of place i felt like i was watching a marvel movie certain transitions from scene to scene were god awful i literally could n't give a shit about any of the new characters especially that asian girl her whole existence was meaningless to me .
the villains oh the villains lord have mercy kylo ren still looks and acts like a angsty emo teen with family issues .
this guy is light years away from a sith lord .
the whole first order feels like a army of play pretend wannabe bad guys .
no one knows who that guy really is where he came from his motives were non existent it 's like he 's the big bad guy for the sake of being the big bad guy .
since he is now dead i really feel that he was just a make ends meet character .
in the end this whole movie felt pointless it did n't add anything to the series it just took a serious step back .
and you 've only ever been revived in that scenario ?
the challenges have been so much better towards the end of this season .
one false move and they could loose parts of japan '' ... .hmmm
i think there are bucket shops that might pit your order against other clients but a reputable broker will actually buy and sell the currencies you intended at the current marking price at the time of your order .
liquidity comes from their market maker so it is possible that there is n't enough cash for your order to execute at the limit/stop price you specified .

manufacturing cars is a solved problem with the only way to lower the price is to move to a low cost labor market .
he acts like designing a car for ease of manufacture is new wisdom when its been standard practice for 50 plus years .

musk is an asshole that takes pride in ignorance .
his quote about never hiring from the detroit auto industry except maybe aston martin .

h264 does n't work in a way that allows bit-shaving .
when snoke is n't a sith but people treat him like he is so you just give up and let it happen .

she seems terrified of the prospect and rightfully so but i grew up in a family with two siblings and would love for my children to have the same .

only in areas with ridiculously high taxes as you can still deduct up to 10,000 .
i live in mo own a million dollar commercial building and a house in the fanciest part of town and i do n't think i even pay that much in property tax although it 's close .
those in states that have voted to tax the crap out of themselves now have to pay a price for those choices .
they 've been riding on the backs of those of us in middle america for years .
those residents of those states allowed and a majority outright fought for high taxes .

in the meantime to meet your ranked hoops dropshot and snow day needs there are some communities dedicated to alternative gamemodes you could join !
rankedhoops is a community for hoops duh that organizes weekly tournaments !
as for dropshot ranked dropshot is a discord server for dropshot lovers !
we have a lot of in-house private matches being played all the time including 2v2 dropshot and had our first and very successful !
rocket hockey league hosts snow day tournaments including hockeyxrumble pumble and has a whole league play format championships series going on right now !
apart from that it must 've been one of the coolest and most welcoming rl communities i 've joined as well .
main goal of these communities is to show psyonix there 's still interest in alternative gamemodes and maybe score a ranked playlist this way but also to provide players with better quality matches and to shorten queue times see you there !
amnesty international has repeatedly criticized europe including germany for not taking enough refugees in .
especially in germany 's case who took in by far the largest amount it 's ridiculous .
it 's quite typical for the loony part of the far-left who think there should be unlimited refugee intake and migration in general into europe basically open borders .
during the height of the refugee crisis amnesty international repeatedly engaged in propaganda by using pictures of women and children while actually over 70 of the migrants were men at the time mostly military aged males .
that too is very typical behavior for the far-left these days .
the current catholic pope washes and kisses muslim migrant feet https i.imgur.com/qsilq0l.jpg .
i 've heard conservative catholics say that they 're embarrassed by him and his behavior multiple times .
catholic churches all over europe want more muslim migrant intake .
in germany there were many cases of catholic and protestant churches skirting the law and giving kirchenasyl '' church asylum yes that 's a thing i do n't know why ... to african or muslim migrants .
pushing for more and more migrant and refugee intake is a typical far-left cause certainly not a conservative or right-wing one you ca n't deny that .
it 's quite absurd that our birth rates are so low that our politicians are pushing for replacement migration from the 3rd world while european woman are allowed to happily kill their children for what boils down to basically egoistical reasons and hedonism .
i do n't know much about human rights watch but horowitz is a jew and a zionist so ... not surprised that there are organizations listed that criticize israel .

it 's quite surprising how close to the statistics this is .

he seemed very surprised when the saber ignites so i doubt he expecting they also show his body just to hammer the point that he is dead and isnt returning

5'4 '' 24 f at a bmi of 25 i have a 31 '' waist .
i feel like that large makes sense to me ... yet when i go shopping all the tops i end up buying are smalls .
i mean if you measure by waist to height and the average height female in the us is 64 '' tall then it makes sense to me at a waist over 32 '' would put most women in the overweight/obese category .
that sounds like a reasonable but not necessarily the best or most reasonable large to me .
i meant to say at this point i definitely feel like i should be large but in most brands i 'm not .
29 '' sounds like the brand runs a little small but keep in mind too that measuring clothes is finicky .
there 's not a size for every measurement when your sizes are letters instead of numbers .
a size cut for a 29 '' waist will also fit an inch or so in either direction .
it sounds a tad small but not unreasonable imo .

i just turned 21 and received my cpl so i am looking to buy my first conceal carry pistol !
i have fired a kimber 1911 45 and a glock 19 gen 3 previously both felt good in my hands while shooting i have large hands .
i am not a fan of 1911 's for conceal carrying .
i have heard a lot about glock 's reliability which is something that matters a lot for my preference .
i am also in favor of .45 i know i know the endless debate .
also i am not a fan of external safety 's .
this process of elimination leads me to the glock 21 .
it is quite large for a conceal carrying but i am 6'2 '' 185 lbs .
any recommendations for carrying a glock 21 as far as carry position and holsters ?
what you have used personally that makes carrying it better or worse ?

when i was eight or nine i lived in a small trailer park .
i had a few friends there and we 'd often spend time near a large house made at some point in the 1800 's .
the house itself was blocked off to public however there was a tire-swing just outside the gate which is where me and my friends would often hang out over there .
one fall day me and my friends let 's call them claire and quinn decided to spend our day by the tire-swing and good off the way we usually did .
quinn sat on the tire-swing and was goofing off when she noticed a light was on in one of the rooms inside the house .
since no one was allowed in the home we 'd figured the lights did n't work but apparently we were wrong .
soon the light went off and we brushed it off and assumed it was some idiot kids trespassing .
a few minutes later another light on the lower floor came on .
the lights continuously shut on and off and me claire and quinn were thoroughly confused .
i looked at what she was staring at so intently .
in the second floor window a man as white as a sheet stood looking at us .
i do n't know how i know but the feeling from looking at him told me that he or it was n't human .
quinn looked pale and claire tugged on quinn 's shirt to get her attention .
the lights shut off and all three of us sprinted out of there .
i have n't seen or heard about anything like that happening there ever since and quite frankly i hope i never do .
granted we do n't know who or what that was we all could tell that whatever it was was n't safe and certainly not normal

so i have been arguing between some alt-coins and ripple seems like a great one to me but i ca n't make my mind up .
it has gone up and up the past week and i ca n't seem to figure out if it will hit a settle point soon and maybe correct a bit .
so i want to hear what you guys target on ripple is ?
many people have good things to say about it but it is currently the coin with the 4th highest market cap so how far can it actually go right now compared to others ?
i know there is n't a right or wrong answer to this but i want to hear some different peoples take on it .

very occasionally i get close to what i want but it usually only lasts for half an hour or so .
my vibrato is usually way too tight and rushed probably 8 hz with a low amplitude .
sometimes it 's easier when i 'm more mentally and emotionally relaxed .
i originally learned to sing with vibrato by imitation and never learned the proper '' way to develop it .

hey so i think i 'm looking for advice in a twofold sense here .
we 're both in our twenites he 's early twenties i 'm late twenties .
i 've had a small number of sexual partners before but due to some personal issues i 'm not actually that sexually experienced sex has traditionally been very painful and uncomfortable for me and i 've not had a great relationship with it .
i 've recently come out of sex therapy and surgery to fix some of my issues and the pain and i 'm a lot more confident about sex now in the sense that i feel like i have a healthy relationship with it and i 'm no longer scared or intimidated by it .
the guy i 'm currently has been saving himself '' for the right woman and he has decided that that woman is me .
we 're very loving and caring towards each other and have had a few conversations about what we can expect when he/we are actually ready .
we 're in a long distance thing at the moment which is due to change next year and while we 've done a bit of petting and done a lot of sexting/camming obviously i 'm expecting actual sex to be quite different .
i 've historically been very nervous in the past about all sex and i 'm naturally a sub whereas even as a virgin he 's naturally a dom .
the way he talks to me he oozes confidence and he 's incredibly good at getting the both of us into a pleasurable state but i do n't want to take this for granted in real life with each other .
he 's told me he 's not nervous at all at the idea of his first time but i also know from experience that how you feel beforehand and how you actually can feel in the moment can be very different i 've made it clear to him that regardless of how well our sexual exploration has gone so far i do n't have any expectations of him in the bedroom in that way because i know he 'll be new at it .
i also want his first time to be you know nice special .
however from reading around it seems like we should expect the first time to be awkward and kind of bad .
so i guess my questions are what makes for bad '' sex for a first timer for a guy ?
all the other guys i 've been with were not virgins and kind of knew what they were doing .
is there anything he/we can do to prepare for this ?
from my perspective i do n't mind if it is 'bad ' or awkward or whatever .
i just want him to have a good time .
i want me to have a good time too obviously but i 'm honestly not as concerned about that for the first time .
seeing as sex is a big and important deal to him ... what can i do ?

update so i went to my local game store and tried a few different sets .
after some back and forth i ended up going with the hyper x clouds .
the sound was good but what sold me was the comfort .
man these things are comfortable as all get out !

each have 4 opteron cpu 's 256gb ram and an ibm/intel 520-da2 10gbe card along with i believe an ibm serveraid m5015 sas controller with 2 450gb 15k 6gb sas drives attached .
i 'll find out what cpu 's are in them one i get to testing them .
supermicro stack 2x 2022g-urf4 4x 2042-6rf and a 12 bay supermicro chassis no mb does n't appear to have ever been used .
except for the 12 bay chassis they have all their cpu sockets populated opteron 6000 series with the 2042-6rf 's having 128gb ram have n't booted/opened the 2022 's yet to verify installed .
now i get to spend a few days booting them all up making sure they work fine .
excited about it it 's the best part of homelabbing .
i 've been wanting to get the game for ages now especially after seeing all the neebs gaming videos on it i love those bastards 3 it 's on sale for just 35 bucks on the psn store but i 'm not sure if i should get it since i remember the game had a really rocky launch on console .
how many major schools of thought or parties do you have ?
im 16 i live an hr from my boyfriend we have been together almost 5 months .
i went to him and his moms house has 19 abt 2 weeks ago i told him a friend of mine was going to his town and i 'm going with to go see him i did n't show up till later abt 8 or so and when i did finally show up he was kinda drunk .
i try to visit him for a couple hours a few times a month bc my friends bf lives by me and takes me there when he sees his gf .
so that night when i showed up after like 10 minutes he asks me to have sex of course i agree and we go to his bathroom .
after a few minutes i notice has being much rougher then usually so i tell him but he did n't seem to care .
he then pulled out and tried to do anal .
i told him not to i do n't like it he keep telling me it 's fine has gunna do it .
i pulled away and he apologized and then we continued and finished ... well after that we hung out in his living room ... i asked him if we could go lay in bed and cuddle i was feeling sad after what happened he said yes but when we got in there and undressed to lay with each other he decided he wanted to have sex again i kept telling him no i did n't want to i just want to cuddle he kept asking and telling me he really wants it and doing everything to make me feel bad until i just say fine and agree ... . after confronting him about it a few days later he said he feels like he raped me ... .my 2 best friends and brother agreed ... .but if so what am i supposed to do ... in suppose to move in next month ... .i love him but am scared it 'll happen again ... i told him this and he said well if it happens again my family will help u ... .idk what to do anymore ... .i do n't wan na leave him he 's made me so happy and so much better ... .but i do n't want hurt
i find it interesting that if you try to challenge or present information that does not support the teachings of legislative curriculum or social acceptance then the information is quickly categorised as either being a myth conspiracy false information or just crazy talk !
is it a symptom of a mental health condition to be challenging the legitimacy of the information provided by authorities governments institutions education ministers etc .
if these questions and statements do not support the ideas of authoritarian teaching and social acceptance ?
i believe a quick stamp and branding of crazy '' to the forehead could be a major deterrent for the real people that are challenging the information that should not be challenged in life .
i 've just had another producer take what my client and i have been working on this week and what i thought was a solid final product and turn it into something totally not what i had in mind and much different than what we discussed during initial mixdown .
additional instruments were added to the overall mix and to me take away from the vibe of the composition .
i want what the artist likes in the end to be sure .
how far do you guys go to stand up for what you think works best ?
the artist has n't yet gotten back to me his thoughts on the end result .
i 've seen this advice around and given it myself .
but it occurs to me i do n't know if it 's at all helpful .
i 'd like to hear people 's thoughts on this if they feel like sharing any .
i also love watching the show rwby from rooster teeth .
i just love anything to do with animations and fight choreography .
my favorite thing is sliced cucumbers mixed with tuna .
i 've been trying to find a guild that raid times i can actually attend but i 've been unsuccessful so far .
i 'm wondering if anyone else has the same issue and is interested in starting a guild .
preferably after 7:00/7:30pm pst during the week or sunday .
if this sounds good to you leave a message here or contact me in game fayynne .
i need someone to draw my human paladin/warlock diero salazar !
as a former paladin of tyr he sought to bring justice .
after a traumatic event caused him to lose faith tyr chose to bind himself to diero 's quarterstaff to try and keep him on the good path .
in an act of desperation diero turned to a demon lord and made a pact to try and free himself .
now he hears both voices arguing over his soul .
at first look you may not know him as a paladin or warlock but perhaps a merchant or trader .
that quarterstaff he carries around everywhere sticks out like a sore thumb .
he has done an amazing role recently off the bench providing that offensive spark plug guys like frank doug and koq cant provide because of his ability to shoot off the dribble .
he is looking like a legit 6moty candidate for us because of that .
and its a good reminder that he 's only 28 years old .
thats younger than guys like derrick rose steph curry and kevin durant .
resigning him to a 16m 2 yr deal with a team option for 3rd seems like a good move going forward .
having someone who has the ability to score 30 off the bench is invaluable to us especially in the playoffs .
it 's sort of a dream job for me .
it 's the exact right size company i want in exactly the right role i want .
i had my second interview today and met with the team did a presentation and the whole dog and pony show .
i have a call with the hiring manager tomorrow at 10am .
i really wish i could shut my brain up but i know that i 'll be happier to be not hungover come good news or bad tomorrow morning .

crockpot pork and green chili stew you can get the mild or hot chilies ... pick based on preference
the turkish lettuce wraps use leftover grilled ribeye or freshly grilled if you like
coconut curry grilled chicken i have n't tried it but i bet you can just broil this for a bit instead of grilling
lemon walnut stuffed avocados this suggests soaking and dehydrating the nuts .
for the people who have a hard time digesting nuts this can help a lot but for everyone else i would n't bother with it too much .
☐ five 3-pound chickens backbones removed chickens cut into 8 pieces each
☐ 1 pound very thinly sliced leftover grilled rib eye
☐ 2 cans ro-tel tomatoes with mild green chiles be sure to get mild unless you really like hot food !
☐ 1 head of garlic cloves peeled and coarsely chopped
☐ 1/2 cup chopped walnuts soak and dehydrate for better digestion
crockpot recipe for pork and green chile stew nefi 's green chile stew
2 cans ro-tel tomatoes with mild green chiles be sure to get mild unless you really like hot food !
trim all visible fat from the pork chops and cut into cubes not bigger than 1 inch square .
heat 1 t olive oil in a large heavy frying pan and cook the pork until it 's well browned about 8-10 minutes seasoning with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste .
you may need to brown the meat in 2 batches if your pan is n't big enough to cook it without the pieces of meat being crowded .
put browned meat into crockpot and add 1/2 cup water to the pan scraping off browned bits from the bottom then pour the liquid over the meat in crockpot .
wipe out the frying pan with a paper towel then heat 1 t olive oil add chopped onions and saute until they start to brown about 5 minutes .
add minced garlic and saute 1-2 minutes more then add the ground cumin and oregano and saute 1 minute more .
add 2 cans ro-tel tomatoes with mild green chiles and the can of diced green anaheim chiles and simmer 5-10 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated .
stir in 2 t fresh-squeezed lime juice and let cook on low for 4-6 hours or until pork is tender and flavors are well blended .
serve hot with sour cream to top it if desired .
in a small bowl whisk the yogurt with the tahini half of the garlic and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice .
whisk in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and season with salt .
in another bowl toss the carrots with the cilantro cumin paprika and the remaining garlic 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of olive oil .
arrange the lettuce leaves on a very large platter and spoon a small dollop of the sesame yogurt in the centers .
top with the beef and the carrot slaw and serve right away .
five 3-pound chickens backbones removed chickens cut into 8 pieces each
in a food processor combine the garlic serranos coriander turmeric curry powder and salt .
add the fish sauce and process to a paste about 30 seconds .
season the chicken with salt and pepper and rub the pieces with 6 tablespoons of the spice paste .
transfer the chicken parts to 4 large sturdy resealable plastic bags .
whisk the coconut milk into the remaining spice paste in the bowl .
pour the spiced coconut milk into the bags of chicken gently squeeze out the air in the bags and seal .
set the bags on a baking sheet and refrigerate overnight .
remove the chicken from the bags discard the marinade .
arrange the chicken on 3 large rimmed baking sheets skin side up keeping all of the breast pieces together on the same sheet .
roast the chicken in batches until browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the meat registers 165° about 25 minutes for white meat and 35 to 40 minutes for dark meat .
if oven space allows roast two sheets at once increase the cooking time by 10 minutes for both the white and dark meat .
remove the chicken from the oven and let rest while you roast the rest .
grill the chicken skin side down over moderate heat until heated through and the skin is crisp .
pmpnote this originally contained some sugar in the curry mix .
i 've removed it but if you feel it lacks sweetness you can add some honey
1/2 cup chopped walnuts soak and dehydrate for better digestion
in a small bowl mix lemon oil basil garlic and salt
let flavors mingle for a few hours before serving the longer the better
i want to get into civ but one of my favorite victory conditions in endless legend 2 is playing as the roving clans and making money .

heyo so i got a new lava lamp called a groovy lamp and was wndering if it would be a decent idea to get a timer and have it set to about 20 mins on and off and start it up once it is fully working .
it seems that cex.io has become a fly by night operation recently .
trusting the reviews i used them before receiving my id verification .
they let you deposit and make trades just fine without id verification but they do n't let you withdraw .
this would be fine if their 24 hour verification '' was honest advertising .
around 12 hours in i received an email saying it may take longer than usual .
36 hours in i sent an email asking for a status .
i received a form reply that the ticket will take a while to receive an actual reply around 12 hours later .
it is now nearly 2 weeks later and i have no follow up on my support ticket my follow up to the ticket or verification .
in addition they have nasty fine print about us sellers they do not make it easy to find that you will have a hell of a time withdrawing even if they verify you .
i 'm guessing his e was slow enough that he reached the wall right as the knockback animation ended .
is that the case or does azir ult not even cancel rek'sai e ?
i 've read so many ppl complaining about the grind and i agree .
would n't 2k want to see everyone maxed out and battleting out ?
your sharp 99 vs shot creator 99 or 99 slasher vs 99 rim protectors ! !
would n't skill be a factor if everyone is maxed ?
i 've played with low 70s players and you really feel the difference in what they are able to do ...
i could lay off on defence and still catch up go for steal or block .
it really feels that most player wo n't hit 99 before 2k19 ... .even when they did the survey that was the highest answer .
if i was designing the game would n't that be on the board .
make sure you have finish '' the game before the next one .
maybe i 'm crazy but 99 vs 99 is what i would like to see .
because ucf only likes it when you follow their degree schedule exactly i 'm only able to enroll in 2 of my game design classes since the other classes are n't available in spring or have pre-reqs .
so in order to have a 4 course schedule this semester i have to take my restricted electives .
what restricted electives do you guys recommend for digital media bas ?
i 've been looking at a few courses but a lot of them have prs i ca n't fill .
i 'm planning on taking evolution of video games since that doesnt have requirements .
i rescued a 3 week old i think puppy from a bad situation long story short owner of mom gave away most of the litter she was left and they abandoned her .
i gave her infant formula from a bottle and saucer though she ate less than 50ml .
she 's gotten a lot of snuggles and now she 's sleeping in a blanket with a water bottle .
how do i keep her alive until i can bring her to the nearest shelter ?
so essentially i can run the game at 120 fps on mostly high settings but whenever i turn or at random intervals my framerate will suddenly and i 'm not sure how to describe this but it either drops to about 1-5 fps or freezes for a second .

i 'm in waterloo during christmas and planning to do some cs projects or even learn some new languages until the school starts again .
i just realized my macbook 's speakers messed up and since i have applecare i want to give it to service .
i was planning to continue my work with the computers on dc/dp libraries but also realized they are closed during christmas holiday .
if i wo n't give the laptop to service now i will have no time to give in-term period since i 'm taking 3 cs course in winter .
it 's only my freshman year in high school and my life has already turned into an episode of degrassi .
so this kid is really introverted and cynical and does n't have many friends so my friend and i decided to talk to him one day .
a month later he was getting kind of clingy and i had to study for finals so i stopped talking to him as much after school and went to the library at lunch .
he asked my other friend what he did wrong and why i was ignoring him i was still talking to him every 2 days or so .
my friend told me he was crying at lunch .
then he took off his sweatshirt that he always wears and i saw cuts on his arm .
there were only 3 they were definitely fresh and very shallow .
i do n't want to jump to conclusions but i feel like he did this for attention .
i felt really bad for him so i started trying to get him to open up he never tells anyone anything even his therapist .
he started asking me if i had a crush and he would not let me get off the hook .
i told him i 'm not into dating right now and asked him if he was interested in anyone .
so then he sends me a google doc on my school account that is filled with 5 pages of poems about me and then he told me he loved me .
i told him i do n't feel the same way and that if he feels this strongly that maybe we should take a break from being friends .
he then started to spam my snapchat with messages about how he loves and appreciates me and i was getting kind of disturbed so i blocked him on impulse .
he will not take the hint that i do n't want to really have contact anymore .
he got me expensive gifts for my birthday and christmas .
tbh i am really uncomfortable and creeped out by all this but i feel like such an asshole !
i ca n't help it but every instinct in my body wants to run away from this kid .
tldr this kid has a massive crush on me and is being so nice that it is creeping me out .
he cut himself and i 'm afraid of telling him i do n't want to be around him anymore .
i feel like everything is my fault what do i do ?

i 've spent around 12 hours since purchasing vorpx just fiddling with the vorpx settings .
this is because none of the games i want to play in vr work .
– skyrim se i uninstalled vanilla to see if se would work it did not
most of these titles should automatically open up in vr and run fairly well providing you follow the correct instructions on how to configure .
however i have followed instructions for each game and nothing will open up in vr .
i configure the profiles then optimise them for the game i want to play then i go to my library and open it up .
but when i click ‘play ' the game will only open on my desktop not inside my vive .
vorpx should convert these games into my headset but it is not .
if i am missing a step which one is that ?
i 've spent so long trying to get games to work somebody please tell me what i 'm doing wrong here .

so awhile ago i decided to start reading on the current run of dc comics and i found a reading order starting with an issue from flash ?
i have never read the new 52 comics and all i know about the current run is wally went missing or something and it involves watchmen .
so i 've decided to get back into it do i need to read the other comics or can i just start with the current run of batman ones and if so which do i start with ?
so i cant draw but would like to provide my players with a good visual for their home base for our upcoming campaign .
i need a tavern map built inside a tree trunk .
the idea of the campaign is that they are small fey creatures that live alongside the real world who borrow '' recources from the giants that roam the land inspired by secret world of arriety '' .
they are going to upgrade this tavern so an empty one would be great .
i also would prefer a three story map with a basement like area but a ground floor only map will suffice .
anyone know of anywere i can find such a map ?
i know it is kinda specific but i thought i might as well try .
ok you know you want to show off that stunt stick of yours .
or better yet you want to show off all five of your skate bananas .
line 'em up on the living room carpet or prop them against the closet door in your dorm and take the blurriest goddamn cell phone picture you can then post it here where nobody cares .
or maybe somebody does care and you can talk about which banana is best .
honestly though if you have a rad quiver and you want to show it off or maybe you just bought your first full set-up or you 're stoked on a new pair of goggles or whatever post 'em here .

frank saved him from the concrete pit but he was never seen in the show after that .
during the episode it seemed like the writers were trying to develop him as a character seems weird that they just got rid of him .
hopefully there 's some big plot twist where he returns or some shit in season 2 .
br2049 was a good sequel to the original blade runner which is a miracle but the original one is fucking masterpiece status .
there 's maybe 100-150 movies ever made that are better than the original the scope is a lot smaller but everything it does is close to perfect .
i just watched it in black and white and it was mind blowing .
also i hope denis villeneuve does n't get stuck making sci-fi movies for the rest of his career i liked sicario and prisoners better than br2049

i made a goal in late october to go social media free for a year facebook instagram twitter snapchat etc and found myself cheating with facebook ... so i deleted it about a week ago delete not deactivate and i feel so liberated and free .
8 years of nearly daily use and idk man feels so good and freeing .
i did n't include reddit on my social media free list because i use it maybe 2-3 hours a week so i did n't see it as a problem site ... which begins my questions and the discussion .
does anyone else have periods of time where they go social media free ?
have you ever deleted a social media account and not looked back ?

after working for 3 years and performing very well with my company i have finally settled on a date .
as of march 1 2018 i am leaving my job and starting my year long solo trip to south america .
ok past few days i 've been waiting for transactions to confirm .
previously it 'd confirm within hours after reattaching a few times .
i 'm trying to grasp my head on how the concept of confirming actually works what are transactions bundles even and maybe use the https github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js api to create something like http www.reattach.online an automated reattaching tool .
bundle a series of transactions as a single address may not have sufficient iota or has too many iotas and needs to transfer the remainder to a fresh address
transfer the process of creating a bundle to move x iota to a specified address
after a bundle is proposed is it that for each transaction within the bundle confirmation of two other transactions on the tangle network is performed ?
3 how does this 'promote ' relate to it ?
4 is reattaching just adding additional branches and hoping that they get confirmed by future transactions ?
5 ideally reattaching should n't even be necessary so does reattaching clog up the network ?
well really beyond this point would be my speculation so i was wondering if anyone could provide an answer or resources to find out .
tldr ca n't figure out how transfers work maybe make a tool to help get transactions confirmed sooner ?
edit i found this doc to be very useful on providing a glossary of terms getting started with the api and anatomy of a transfer .
according to his linkedin he is apparently an expert in 'fin legal it politic ' sic .

and this mike used to work at the front desk of our office building and she 's perfectly nice but a little rough around the edges .
because i 've been here the longest and know the job like the back of my hand i get the glorious job of training new folks .
the first day actually training and going over the system mike spends it yawning loudly complaining about being tired and dicking around on her phone .
then she would ask random non-sequitur questions like why do you have three monitors ?
why do you have a lightening port if you do n't own an iphone ?
people in my pictures just random ass stuff not work related etc ...
and i mean it 's mostly normal but she 'll ask these questions while we are working on stuff and trying to focus .
then when i have clients on speaker phone she 'll yawn loudly make noises etc .
yesterday she tried to correct me on my job .
because she 's buddies with the other office mike mika who is also on my shit list but for other reasons .
mike will go back to mika and ask her for help on things i trained her on and things that do n't make sense to her ... and i 'm just thinking to myself because i like my job and want to keep it why are you asking for help from not the person who is training you but the person who is known for consistently fucking up ? ? ? ? ''
also she 'll start up random conversations about stuff like alcohol consumption .
and i 'm by no means a prude i do drink .
and we started talking about what we liked and did n't like .
your so must be mad because it makes you horny . ''
also in the middle of working a case she just up and left to take a personal call and disappeared for like half an hour .
and i 'm not a boss or a baby sitter .
my boss is out of the office until thursday .
update i just threw mike and mika under the bus with my boss ' boss out go to because our boss is out .
edit fyi i 'm a female and mike is a female .

i 'm willing to show off my girlfriend for the most part just to give you an idea just do n't be too picky ...

i just love the verbal humiliation and the part where you clearly show me you 're better than me .
primarily what 's a ship that you love to play can do consistently well in but just ca n't seem to get a win in ?
for me it 's the hindenburg i average over 100k damage in that ship love the hell out of it .
but the past few weeks i have n't been able to buy a win in it .
last night for example i did 176,000 damage with 3 kills but still lost .
i now have at least 172000000 experience points in the constitution skill .
perhaps give it a special attack of 2 fishing boost lower than dragon harpoon to keep the harpoon relevant .
this could perhaps be a reward from raids 2 ?
so i was looking over the backgrounds for a new character in dnd beyond and the haunted one seemed a little op .

who has to work for how long and how productive do you intend on being ?
careful you do n't pronounce the r at the end of words when it 's er .
there are a few exception but otherwise it 's e
if you are correctly pronouncing the r there should n't be much difficulty actually .
are you pronouncing it like the r in rua '' ?
it 's not a rolled r it 's a dry throaty r right ?
because if you are rolling the tongue then yes it 's super difficult !
otherwise i just tell my students the consonants separately .
try trente trois '' it 's a classic for feeling throat vibration .
when you 're later confronted with more difficult combos such as arbre '' you go through the same process of decomposing the syllables
you have all the knowledge already coming from portuguese pronunciation .
also drink water or you 'll irritate your throat quickly hahaha
her dad is a jedi that has no respect for the boring old jedi crap and has no problem bending the rule book .
that 's why i think her dad is yoda .
and i ca n't wait until yoda appears to her and explain why he did n't use protection .
so i understand the importance of realizing there is a world outside your bubble and you need to accept the accounts of others .
however at what point does the media narrative become so divorced from anything you can even find in the real world if you were actively searching that you go i think these people might be full of shit ... '' ?
how many people do you know who live in states where the state government did n't explicitly block the medicare expansion ?
iirc you 're a slightly older professional who makes a lot of money .

that 's not what we 're talking about here .
there is only one well within the context of any given tradition that is .
if there are two then it 's by definition not god .
you 're edging up to the line of animism .
worshiping a thing as a deity might not actually meet most definitional requirements for a god but rather for an idol .
a much simpler definition and one that i use is an omnipotent being ...
i do n't think that the more monotheistic strains of hinduism would even consider the assertion of god 's omnipotence to be logically coherent .
it would be a bit like saying that a city can build anything .
it 's the people in the city that do things .
if i understand correctly this is synonymous with everything '' .
most things are not an embodiment of a force ...
i 'm not sure how you would come to think that .
well i cited my sources how about you cite yours ...
also to add to this if you want the canvas to be higher resolution '' while you 're sculpting you need to use document zoom to zoom out of the canvas so the whole resolution of it scales into the canvas size .
this is a nice way to get some anti-aliasing in zbrush but it can slow things down considerably as you get into the millions of polys if you 're doing double resolution .

my imagination initially had it that as some sort of weird respect everyone has for leia they call a ceasefire .
kylo goes to the funeral and of course everyone is shocked that he 's there and start wondering if its a trap .
kylo pays his respects and then makes an announcement that the first order will no longer be holding back in their fights which puts everyone on edge because the past few battles with the first order have not been easy .
turns out kylo is indeed telling the truth and the war becomes more brutal .
it seems that the death of leia has fully released kylo from whatever emotional bonds he has left for his family .
he 's not a pump and dumper mate i 'm in his group .
he calls trades every now and then and posts videos about the market ... never has he pumped and dumped a coin in his group and i have been in it from the start .
i 'm australian and have no horse in this race and the science that i believe in is there with some support of his claim .
that is a rage boost just like the ones gohan used to get .
not 'rage blue ' like it 's a new form .

you know what else is predictable in these comments ?
virtue signallers who display their level of compassion as if it was some sort of pissing contest .
people who chastise others for having a less compassionate but reasonable opinion .
a bunch of people want '' to watch addicts die .
you are right that addiction is a disease but in the same way type 2 diabetes or aids are diseases there is some aspect of personal responsibility that comes with it .
it 's not a disease like the flu or cancer .
there are real-time personal decisions that were made that led them to this addiction and it could have been avoided .

so please look at the bigger picture and tell me how this tax reform is a good idea .

it 's just the newest and shittiest version of the tax policy that has been harmful to the middle class for the past three and a half decades or so .
what made that show great and what makes it better than friends in my opinion was that it had an over arching narrative throughout the show .

we-the-fans were always going to wonder who rey was and there was always going to be absolutely rampant speculation about her parentage simply because of the fact she 's a force user so naturally she must be related to another force user .
if the movie had n't made a mention of who is she ? ''
then it would have seemed at least slightly a conspicuous absence .
so instead the movie teases ever-so-slightly at it and let 's be fucking honest it was pretty fucking light until it got dissected to hell and back .
well now that the question is raised either in the movie or just by the fanbase we need an answer because just ignoring the question is worse .
it 's got ta be someone from the movies because basing it on a character from the clone wars series a book or a comic is just going to be too obscure to connect and have impact for general audiences .
so that leaves us with a pretty narrow selection to work with .
would any of these made sense and carried much impact ?
the response to all of these is either well okay but ... so what ? ''
or huh that ... does n't really make sense . ''
i really do n't see how her relation to any of those characters would actually mean much for the story .
the only other answer and one that does carry an impact is that she 's not descended from anyone important after all .
not only is that unexpected '' but it carries the message that anyone can be important and be a hero and that the force is not a matter of noble blood but of life the universe and everything .
sure it does n't turn the buildup '' which again honestly was n't that much into an important answer but it makes sense and it gives us an impact simply by being unexpected .
the only other follow-up i can see to this would be that her parents are n't just nobodies '' but literally nobody .
as in she never had any parents at all just manifested directly out of the force like anakin 's immaculate conception but a step further .
and they 'd ... really need to build a good foundation for that not to seem stupid as fuck .
tl dr who rey is '' never mattered should never have been a question of consequence and we got the only answer we deserved .
i 'm not really active about boycotting things but after he said that shit i 've gotten dominos when i 'd normally get papa johns .
gon na keep doing it so long as he 's on the board .
if you 're gon na be that much of a jackass your pizza better be fucking fire .
yes but he shipped in all his boyfriends to sway the vote .
that 's what is so concerning about people thinking bg could be preparing his next prey there so many places to hike in indiana .
a friend of mine wants to go hiking and i am not longer comfortable being with just one other person ... that being said we will probably have to be in a group of 4 for me to feel at ease
i see that kind of focus definitely lets you add more personality and flavor to the image than a packed group photo would .
both have their merits but maybe the arc 26 meeting really would n't work that well in an image format .
your explanations are always so insightful feels like i 'm learning so much about the thought process that goes into making these works of art with all these details to consider even before a single pixel is drawn !
thank you for taking the time to discuss it with us
to be quite honest with you it looks waaay better than the first i made .
yes almost everybody hates these things which makes it s perfect setting to talk to people you normally do n't talk to .
if they say no you agree and ask where they would rather be .
if they say yes ask them how they do it ? you know enjoy a party like this .
yeah it 's really crummy to have to forget '' everything i 've learned in the expanded universe over the past 25 years .

you wo n't be able to file a lien on his home for multiple reasons
2 your lawsuit would be with the company not him personally .
instead you file a lien on the company and then show up with the sheriffs department and seize enough equipment etc .
to be approximately the same value as what you are owed .
oh and i recommend seizing server and networking equipment first .
that will have the biggest impact on day to day operations

correct me if i 'm wrong but given the at-will employment are n't the employees free to leave and work elsewhere if they 're not happy with the deal on the table ?
are we supposed to distort the market so much that we ca n't even let individuals signal what matters to them ?
i really do n't agree with any of that sentence but the white part
jesus a 60/40 blend at 6mg of nic is no way to start vaping .
more pg more throat hit and more nicotine more throat hit .
if you 're really interested in vaping but want a smoother experience try and 80/20 or even 90/10 vg to pg juice with 3 to 0mg of nicotine .
also do n't take hits like you 're smoking a cigarette .
for the majority of atomizers you 're gon na want to hit it like a bong .
if that is n't 100 clear to you just inhale directly into your lungs then exhale the vapor .

i think ultimately my perspective comes from the fact that i view alibaba very differently than i view an ecommerce site .
it 's a grocery store vs. a restaurant store or a boutique vs. a tj maxx a place like alibaba is very utilitarian .
like those examples i know i 'm going to need to do a lot of work and vetting on my own .
i wo n't turn down something because the initial display looks off and frankly this is what i think most buyers on alibaba are like .
none of us would make a purchasing decision based just on photos alibaba has a lot of other criteria that informs this decision .
the effort of taking beautiful photos and presenting them is down to me .
because my customer is discerning and is picking between individuals based on value and brand .
whereas my requirements are very different photo trust would n't do it for me as a bulk buyer .
but in any case it 's just my opinion on why we do n't see very much of this .
also i 've found that factories are willing to send more/better photos if you ask for them .
and you know if factories started committing to making better photos a common practice i would be into it .
i kind of just assumed it was the helmet itself ?
but it directly points out that you 're basically an unkillable puppet for the traveler attempting xenocide on the servants of a rival god there 're tons of puppets just like you throughout the entire system and how the whole situation is actually pretty fucked up .
the simplicity and bluntness you see in the tab actually makes it one of my favorite bits of flavor text/lore in d2 .
yeah that would have been a good time to quietly reintroduce the kentucky fraud chickens in the background

yeah this is n't the sort of thing i normally think about so it was a loose stab in the dark for me for sure xd .

i would totally agree up until this week i 've had better luck recently executing orders on the first try ! ! !
maybe i 'm just lucky but i hope it 's true .
they have so many options and could crush coinbase if they straighten up .
meh i was on board with a lot of complaints about the film and still am but i do not find it to be the worst movie of the franchise .
i dislike the casino scene and some of the choices .
however i found the character development to be good .
kylo went from whiney and conflicted to taking a spot as a slightly less whiny definitive villain .
and i do n't think he died from exertion of the projection but consciously choose to join the force .
plus it is the middle movie in the trilogy .
but without the return of the jedi right after it there would be a lot of problems and what the hell moments on how it ended .
it 's a movie that needs to be judged in terms of what came before and after it .
i think this will also be how the last jedi is .
perhaps not amazing on its own but better when looked at within the framework of the trilogy .
holy shit i saw a car with lashes at a starbucks drive thru the other day and i could n't figure out what kind of branding it was for .
i honestly ca n't decide if this is broken or not .
on one hand you have to get to max level on rubick who is mostly a support but on the other killing someone with one button is absurd .

he should be running linux with system specs that low .
my only complaint/suggestion is the lack of dynasty warriors support .
the warriors franchise does n't really have a significant historical divergence and so even if someone wanted to create a new dw jump it would end up overlapping significantly with this one .
personally i recommend kof14 i think it 's a very fun game and have been long time fan of it .
can someone loop it so its just her booty ?
i think overwatch is good enough to be a full priced game even if they completely removed all progression and unlockable aesthetics .
them giving lootboxes so i can play to unlock anything at all is a bonus

i wanted to see more 'how bout this game ? '
technically your post did fill the parameters but the parameters were n't specifically what i meant .
i just did n't think that there would be a fic like this .
i meant more for a self insert typical akatsuki member .
the other options were an oral dose of the medication which is already proving ineffective surgical removal of the thyroid and supplementation the cat would likely not survive anesthesia or injection with radioactive iodine which would theoretically accumulate in the thyroid and ablate it from the inside requiring a specialized clinic and weeks of observation to ensure radioactive urine and feces are n't being spread .
i look forward to meeting the new cat next christmas .
it 's not that the cat is n't being fed if anything he 's eating more than usual due to the hyperthyroidism .

the payout for this bowl is 1.2m per team iirc .
as to the ncaa 's incompetence..let 's just say this is not surprising to any of us that have watched this sport for awhile .
since the 1.0 update i have this problem with the red dot sight and the holographic sight .
i did n't find a red dot in time i just quickly joined a match to take screenshots but it 's basically a giant pixelated square instead of a dot .
the strange thing is that when i place the red dot sight on a pistol it looks normal .
i really do n't understand what 's going on .
it 's only on rifles and the kar98 and such that i have this problem .
i did notice that the new scrolling your zoom '' feature reduces/increases the pixelation but it remains pretty much unplayable .
this pretty much makes the game unplayable in short range .
i have no idea what 's causing this and it 's very frustrating .
i 've tried different resolutions from the lowest to 1080p to windowed fullscreen which i used to play on before the patch different settings from very low to ultra in every combination .
my remaining launch options are the following useallavailablecores malloc=system maxmem=13000 but i doubt any of these are causing it .
please guys i beg of you does anyone have a fix for this ?
i really want to enjoy the game but this makes it impossible as i ca n't use ads like this only on pistols does it look like it should ...
land rover thing in the uk but mainly defenders or series .

the green one with sliverfall is probably the most op .
so whenever a sliver both card and token enters you trigger the host effect for each sliver creature you control .
you can also use noodles 1 to make your opponent a sliver .
next turn after your attack 3 noodles giving defender to all slivers .
under un-set rules your opponent ca n't attack during their combat .
you replied to a post instead of starting a new post .

this is part of why i love taiwanese dramas .
almost every one has a second lead that has their own love interest frequently the other second lead .
it 's worth watching just for the supportive lady friendships .
i mean the bromances are there too but the lady friendships stand out so much more because they are so rare in comparison to kdramas .
every time there 's a secondary couple i probably rate that kdrama higher just because it has something standard in taiwanese dramas .
and when taiwanese dramas do n't have one i bitch and complain that it 's too much like a kdrama .
they still have their evil secondary characters but it feels better to have that extra couple to soften the blow .
i think all of their players secretly had two sticks .
they were all over the place all night it was crazy .

perhaps if the mls makes them agree to only making ford field a temporary solution that would be good enough .
they have by far the richest ownership group and a large desirable media/metro market .
the longer it drags out the more it feels like the mls either wants them all the bids to fall apart or just sacramento and cinicnnati so they can select detroit under the premise of 'last man standing . '

in '' context spoilers for hxh let me preface this by saying hxh is one of my top 3 animes and probably 1 on most days .
the context for the picture above is that gon goes to a very dark place after learning that his friend was killed by a super powerful catlady who is really an ant and also one of the three kings guard to the king of the ants .

i generally disagree that you can just call something a word and therefore it is .
yes you should get him out of your life .
it 's a hard lesson to learn in your twenties that some people just kind of never stop being teenagers who expect people to pay for life for them .
their parents did it and then they sort of turn their friends into those figures rather than face adulthood .

i do n't really think it needs to be something so hidden away .
i 've actually often thought about prostitution but with stds the risk of pregnancy the risk of being maimed or murdered the mass amounts of corruption and rampant abuse in the industry and the legal situation it 's a no go .
i do get a bit weirderd out by family oriented stuff but that 's because my family does n't even hug each other really so the idea of being open about sexuality with them is just so far from left field i ca n't process it .
but i 'd totally take a job as a hotel accommodation if the free use universe was real .
now it may be good to note that i 'm in an essentially sexless marriage we 're working on it and so i may be more sex starved than most and the sex we do have is n't great and it does n't generate an emotional connection .
so my perspective as a woman may be different than others that have had emotionally or sexually fulfilling relationships .
so i ca n't think it 's a reach if i do n't value him as a 1st ?
of course elway is n't gon na think he 's reaching as he 'll end up drafting him where he has him valued .
but if i think he 's a second rounder and we draft him in the 1st i consider that a reach .
sure elway wo n't and he 's obviously more qualified but that does n't mean its not a reach in my book if i think hes a 2nd .

i 'll let pc keep running but otherwise it 's time to wrap presents and do christmas shit .
these patriots should never have to fight for a home as long as we exist .
i 'm not using that as an insult i 'm straight up telling you i think you have a problem and need to seek help .
are you sure you are responding to the right person ?
are you talking about crypto only or your mothers pubic hairs ?
what i mean is that is takes about half an hour to scrape 10k .
i played the first map default 100 days a few times and it always shows up at day 91-92 .
it amounts to the same thing with a side of user freedom .
i laugh because i no longer know what else to do .
it 's scary how much the mass public cares about celebrities and how little they care about history and politics .
thought it was gon na be called no ball because there were more than 2 fielders outside the inner oval so he slashed at it and got 6 .
turns out the first 10 overs had already passed so it was n't actually a no ball so he played a really risky shot .
chazz is the one that drops despair from the dark .
and he can get at least one of the other two just by leveling up bonz .
removed and i bet you 've already been banned from the sub .
he ignored everyone was sulky rude and just brought the entire group down with his attitude .
he tried to sneak away without paying me the remaining 50 and i had to catch up to him and ask him for the rest of the money which he ended up throwing at me before storming off angrily .
i actually used to pay for his food and alcohol a lot but my wife made me stop .
why associate with someone like this at all to begin with ?
to prevent spam and scams your account must be older than 2 months to post here .
i am a bot and this action was performed automatically .
please contact the moderators of this subreddit message/compose ? to=/r/steambotmarket if you have any questions or concerns .
i 'm wondering if he spoke about it a bit more in depth and said something that clarifies that he 's talking about bch .
and the board in charge of enforcing these wide-ranging and stupidly strict rules somehow became composed mostly of power-hungry gossip-mongers who have too much time on their hands ?
the scenes with the wand made it feel so powerful on my surround sound lol i just wish we got to see more magic and less bang bang stab stab .
simmons is not that good but he has potential to be great
that 's why i list gold and silver and oil/gas because those currencies '' do actually have physical properties and practicality in real life .
if you start a replay of this game at 11:59:59 pm on new year 's eve at midnight you can hear espn start jerking it to josh allen .
about interceptors superior power named nullification there is few methods to quickly delete ceptor gang from gate stop complaining about ceptors nullification its fine
if we could have nullification module for ship that could work like panic button on rorqual it would give u 30 seconds of nullification then module is destroyed vanishes from med slot
the cost of module would be 50-100m but in price of saving your cargo from bubble its worth and combined impel with warp core stabs and nullification module could get you going and not complain about bubbles .
there would be thousands of killmails of people trying the nullification moduleon their carriers dreads rorquals and supers/titans
there would be only one t1 version of this module one t2 one faction and one officer variant t1 version nullification effect would last 20 seconds on t2 30 seconds faction 35 seconds officer 40 with skills up to one minute on officer 55 on faction 50 on t2 and 45 on t1 the skill would be named
nullification module could be stopped only by hic focused warp scrambling script .
and nullification array would take 50m3 of cargo so you could have limited amount of backup parts
around here it 's the night before christmas https youtu.be/ztfmwe08y3s '' !
we love turning the lights down and listing to a reading of it .
something timeless about it ... kind of neat you feel connected to all the other families that have celebrated christmas over the past 100 years !

also what are some songs u were surprised they hit no 1 only to find out they hit it bubbling under ?
i bought cossacks 3 this week and i have no sound .

it has been mentioned several times through out the games that adam is its own measurement .
ryan has said things like 300 adam for the man or woman who kills the intruder '' and you receive adam in the form of 200 adam '' or some other number .
my question is if there is a conversion for adam to cm^2 or something like that .
it 's definitely time i got serious about some weight loss goals .
i have tried variations of diets a few times in the past and have trouble making the transition .
since xmas at my house is n't too difficult to eat okay focus on meat and veggies leave the goodies for everyone else i 'm going to use that as day one and start then !
my question is in that first week cravings are generally very bad for me and so i am hoping to find some good and especially tasty little recipes to make during this first week that you all think would keep me on the right path ?
i plan on doing alot with ground beef eventually but i am a bit uh grossed out by the prospect of just eating a pile of ground beef starting out .
hey guys i 've been trying to look into how i could create a means of creating the trends in zabbix and emailing them to admin accounts around every 1 month mark .
i have n't seen anything in the documentation directly related to this and no straightforward forum posts that really answer the questions .
this seems like a pretty standard feature though so just asking if there 's a simple means of doing this .
edit so to clarify here 's the post i made to r/sysadmin as this is what i 'd like to accomplish
hey guys just asking about the following with zabbix the network monitoring tool .
is it possible to set up zabbix to send triggers in aggregate every hour instead of one at a time as well as is it possible to configure zabbix to email a summary of average resource usage over a 1-month period as well as showing all major triggers during that period ?
help would be much appreciated as i 'm pretty new to zabbix and i really want it to set it up properly because it will be deployed on a large scale for our customers down the line .
for us who dont have many btc transactions they take high percentage i want to invest in ada but dont know if its worth it since transfering btc to binance gon na cost me another 35 ... should i wait till bitcoin price goes up ?

so out family dog charlie is a golden retriever and because he was able to jump over the gate this summer and have free reign over the entire house for a day we made the mudroom his room .
he hates it in there and we only put him in there at night or when he 's bad but lately he 's been biting the walls and even made a hole in one part of it .
it 's gotten to the point where any option for where we put him would be a bad idea so how should we get him to stop ?
so this problem has acquired recently and i suspect windows 10 for it .
i am getting low fps on games such as cs go .
while having low cpu and memory usage and a high usage on the gpu which was always this way .
i dont see any technical reasons for this only a windows 10 update .
ask me anything you need to know to solve this problem .
i want to play mgs 3 snake eater for the 1st time .
i 've read that i can use ps2 port on pc .
but i 've seen on youtube there 's a normal version ps2 hd and ps3 hd right ?
can you tell me if i can run this game 's ps3 hd verion on pc ?
i know piracy is bad but i guess there 's no official port on pc of mgs3 right ?
i really have no experience of using this kind of thing i mean emulators .
i know i can find some guides how to emulate but can you just tell me where can i download this game with the best graphic which is ps3 hd i suppose ?
i checked the pirate bay torrent but there 's only non-hd version ... and sorry for my poor english i 'm not a native english speaker .
currently running big spell priest but not a big fan of it .
so with emma 's new faction starting out strong with sam witwer and andreyko does anyone else find it kind of dumb that she just ignored jason inman after he basically asked to join after he became champion ?
i thought any manager would be honored to have a champion join their team especially a good guy like inman .
mil immediately started in with her stupid stories where she 's the heroine and everything is just sooooo glamorous .
bitch if we were n't paying on the condo you live in you 'd be on the street .
by yesterday morning i was already done with it .
she said do you want to hear the story about my flannel ? ''
i was trying to deal with my kid and i glanced at her and said no not really . ''
you know that wordless whine kids do when they do n't get what they want ?
twice yesterday she did this new thing instead of being a normal person and saying something like 'hey that looks good may i try that ? '
she does this thing where she looks at the object one a food item the other a glass of wine then gives the little flirty begging eyes with this almost creepy smile on her face .
when she did it a second time last night i was short with her if you 'd like some just ask ! ''
i got my ass out for coffee alone reaaaallllly early this morning .
should i name my mil the prattler '' or the bec queen '' ?
because after dear bippy 's revelation yesterday re fucking linda my mil is nowhere on the scale and there will likely never be a story that comes even close to that sort of heinousness .
hey owuniversity today i bring you a vod review i did for ineedpeeling !

several businesses accept '' bitcoin cash via shapeshift integration this really should n't be considered bch acceptance for multiple reasons .
firstly all you 're doing is selling your bch for btc and then they receive the btc .
secondly and more importantly you still have to pay the btc transaction fee so it is still not economically feasible to pay with bch via shapeshift .
could we update the acceptbitcoin.cash initiative to remove the bch support note for sites that merely have shapeshift integration ?
like the title says.i feel like i ca n't take care of myself .
that i need them in my life to survive .
and when they leave it feels like i 'm being cut from my life source .
i get upset that my fp ca n't read my mind and buy me freaking flowers
i found an article some years ago about an artist who illustrated what modern animals would look like using the methods they use for predicting what dinosaurs looked like based purely on skeleton .
basically the whole point of the article/exercise was to point out that we do n't know for sure the fat and muscle distribution of these animals based only on their skeletons and hat they could look wildly different .
i ca n't find the article again and do n't know what to search to find it .
one of my biggest fantasies is the idea of giving my body to someone to protect my family .
whether it 's my son 's bully my husband 's boss or even my son 's teacher the idea of protecting them by giving their tormentor my body really gets me going .
the scenario that 's always been in the back of my mind and has come back full force this season is santa .
as silly as that sounds it really really gets me going .
either it 's a mall santa being a creep and touching me during the picture ending with me bent over in an alley panties bunched up around my ankles as he plows into me .
or if you 're in the christmas spirit it 's the real santa .
he 's come down from the north pole to inform me my son is on the naughty list and getting coal .
but with my help i can get him back on the nice list .
my kinks are doggy style cum play gangbang hair pulling spanking name calling and rough sex .

the hangover trilogy is one of my most favourite comedy trilogies.so if you fellas know some movies like it please let me know.though i know the hangover is one of a kind .
i was hoping to do a roleplay involving one of you fucking my mom .
i mean what guy did n't imagine fucking his mates mom when they were growing up .
imagine being able to lord that over your mate .
it can be a number of ways you can be staying at mine and she catches you showering maybe it is on holiday and she invited you with us maybe she comes to visit me at college maybe we are a nudist family and she encourages you to join in .
i 'd love to watch it for the roleplay but if not we can play out you telling me what went down .
hope to hear from you also any hot gifs of what you would do to her would be great !
she kind of looks a bit like the pornstar chanel preston if that helps any mental images .
i think this is one reason why i have sa .
i 've always felt unwanted weird and that my family only loves me because i have their blood in me .
i found out that my almost 2 year old son loves the magic flute opera .
since then i 've been trying to show him youtube clips of easy listening classical music .
all i found is relaxing lullabies for babies and some disney/wb bits which are nice but the slapstick in them are terrifying him .
so basically i 'm looking for nice calm animation with famous classical music bits .

hi as someone who just bought a lp120 i am currently on the lookout for an amp and speakers .
upon looking online i found many price ranges of amps some from 30 just containing 1 volume knob some from 80 appearing like a normal amp and much more expensive ones .
is there much of difference as in does it affect sound quality ?
any suggestions for good speakers to connect to this would be helpful as well
so my family is kind of unusual and we have a aoe2 lan game atleast one time a year .

hi i 've just recently started using firefox because of quantum .
i was wondering if there was a way to have it not suggest the root of the website unless it 's the most visited .
by this i mean for example if i clear all of my history and then i type in twitch.tv/directory/following/live and press enter .
the next time i type in tw '' and so on it suggests the root of the website twitch.tv instead of the directory/following/live .
i would like it to suggest the most visited url for the characters entered so far regardless of whether it is the root of the website or not .
apologies for the explanation if this question already exists not exactly sure how to word it .
the new brawl mode is fun but for the last 4 matches i 've played people are only selecting warlord and raider and lawbringer just to ledge people it 's to the point where my last match was only me trying to dodge being thrown by raider and warlord i did n't get one actual fight the entire match .
i 'm not one to hate on how people enjoy their game but if you play this way go fuck yourself .
edit and as i was typing this comment still in the game i baited the warlord into ledging himself while i stood on the glitch spot this is the first time i 'm using it i needed a break from the gb spam i got disconnected for inactivity for somehow when i was barely on the thing for 10 seconds guess that 's what i get lol .

i 've been dealing with this throat issue for the past 3 months now with little improvement .
my major symptoms are throat tightness discomfort and shortness of breath .
i burned my throat a year ago due to minocycline pill getting stuck in there .
was in major pain for 3 months but recovered .
then in sept i started getting my current symptoms .
doctors think it may be asthma and gerd acid reflux .
i 've been on nexium and prevacid proton pump inhibitors since then .
i recently had an allergy test and found i was allergic to cats dust mites and histamine .
the blotch on my skin was quite large according to the nurse .
my current theory is my previous burn made my throat very sensitive to histamine causing inflammation thus the feeling of tightness .
i 've tried zyrtec anti-histamine but those only seem to help a little .
i might be really sensitive to histamine in general the skin on my legs is generally dry and itchy .
i 've been in misery for the past 3 months and just want some relief .
does anyone else experience the most fear with the sound of people vomiting ?

suck '' i say extending my thumb to your mouth .
you look up at me with your gorgeous brown eyes and nod your head .
yes master '' you say before taking my thumb into your mouth and sucking obediently .
you 've been my slave long enough to know that when i tell you to suck you suck .
i look down at you and smile my free hand stroking your hair almost sweetly .
my cock is hard enough to be straining through my jeans but i 'm in no rush .
it 's nicer when a black bitch has to work for it i think .
my hand grips your hair as i notice the mess you have failed to clean up on the kitchen counter .
i take my thumb out of your mouth and slap you across the face backhanded .
i pull you up by your hair and point to the counter .
the metal leash on your collar makes a loud clanking sound as it knocks against the sink .
what 's the point in having a black cunt like you as a slave if you do n't clean up after yourself ? ''
i slap you across the face again hard enough to leave a red mark against your black skin .
is this any way to treat your master ? ''
as you can tell i am quite into raceplay as well as pain humiliation misogyny body shaming and more traditional bdsm .
i would love to play this or a related prompt and i 'm happy starting from earlier in the story and breaking you down until you 're my docile little slave .
i also enjoy just chatting if that 's more your speed .
congrats 2015 i wish our team even need an honest answer .

hello brethren i 'm getting a bluetooth speaker for christmas and i 'd like to get something preferably around 25 but i 'm open to a tad bit more to add bluetooth functionality to my battlestation .
i 'd prefer pcie but if that 's not possible a usb device is doable so long as the range is decent .
so i am currently living on guam and as far as i know there is only 1 piano store on the entire island a yamaha store if that matters .
i went to check it out with the intention of getting an acoustic piano or a digital piano that 's better than the one i have now .
when i went there to test out the acoustic pianos they were all out of tune .
the manager came up to me and asked me if i needed help .
i told him that i wanted to get a piano but they are all out of tune .
he assured me that they tune them after they are purchased and before they deliver them .
my issue is that i do n't want to buy a piano unless i know it sounds good first .
when i asked if he could tune it before a purchase he said i 'd have to pay for it to be tuned .
do n't get me wrong i loved the sq42 demo just that when the player character stealth killed those guards i couldnt help but wish for non lethal take down options .
im sure these are planned would have just been good to see .
whilst im at it i hope we can also drag/hide the bodies too .
so i 'm new to reddit but a long time summoners war player who has recently started devoting more time and energy into rta .
in fact in between bouts of rage and tears i had a moment of inspiration .
i needed a way to cope with the stress of rta preferably an alternative to injuring my phone rip phone .
my brilliant idea is this stress balls with the face of the mons i most hate to encounter in rta .
this way the stress is diverted into something less breakable again rip phone .
currently i 'm planning on making ones for orion theo and gany but i 'm sure i 'll find more soon .
would anyone else be interested if they were made available ?
also what additional mons would you like to see printed ?
they were together for 37 years but never married .
she just found out that he made a will 40 years ago that gave everything to his brother .
they did n't have much but now that she already paid for the funeral she 's in debts .
she does n't know if his brother is even going to pay for the funeral .
that made me think of how many women and men out there do n't have any idea about their spouse finances and if they have a will .
i think that maybe for some of you it 's time for that uncomfortable discussion .
i can almost never say hey insert name what 's up ?
i just want to try it since you are n't allowed run around on your own in the maps .

i have a monthly data cap of 475gb and i already push that to it 's limit every month that 's why i 'm asking .
i came across this little gem on steam today that reminds me of rastan .
i was just given a betta as a secret santa present .
i have a cycled 75 gallon at home i can put him in .
i 've never had bettas before so i 'm totally new .
they also gave me some betta pellets and a moss ball with him .
the betta was actually from my sister who had forgotten to get me a gift .
knowing i liked fish she gave me her betta which had previously been living in less than half a gallon of water with no filter heater or light .
she has had the betta for about a year and has only done 3 water changes each when she had moved house .
when she gave me the moss ball she said here get this too .
the water she poured into the bag i brought him home in was literally pink .
i was prescribed 60mg of pred after being diagnosed with uc at the end of summer and have finally weened off of the steroid following a very long tapering session .
i gradually brought the dosage down 5mg per week before stopping 2 weeks ago .
since stopping i 've had severe joint pain i had some joint pain while taking it mostly in my knees but i notice this most in my hands now its worse after just waking up but persists as a dull ache throughout the day .
i also get very stiff when i stand up even if i 've only been sitting for a couple of minutes i feel like i have to hobble around a little bit before the pain in my legs goes away .
i 'm relatively young 28 but i feel like this experience has aged me by 20years .
i know prednisone is commonly prescribed temporarily for conditions like ours and was wondering if anyone else experienced this after coming off of it and any suggestions to deal with this ?
it 's mentally exhausting to deal with an n-parent or n-family over the holidays .
growing up i was constantly walking on eggshells since any comment would result in a 3-hour blow-up and lecture .
yet i still find myself visiting them over holidays and breaks .
i do n't know why but i feel like i have no strength and power to say no to them .
maybe because it 's not bad all the time and those rare moments that everyone is smiling and getting along ...
i just crave the normal family experience that my friends have .
and i wo n't lie things are good for the first few hours but then after that.. someone picks a fight my sexist n-dad starts to bellow about how i 'm acting like a woman '' and i 'm female my mother starts to cry and my brother curses everyone and storms out .
i guess what prompted me to write this is this my boyfriend expressed what wonderful time he is having with his parents these holidays and i so badly want to relate to him .
i just want to talk to someone about how hard it 's been at home and i feel like i ca n't tell him as it 'll bring him down .
it 's exhausting to leave an n-family get together and still have to put on a happy face and pretend everything is okay .
so little late but we 're doing a discord hangout at 1:30pm gmt !
or are we gon na just talk about maths and politics again ?
if you have any problems coming on ask me here
raoaers i am off of work until january 2nd and am super excited to spend time with my husband and young daughter .
this is the longest time my husband and i have both had off of work together in several years !
to come up with ideas i 'm hosting my first contest and asking my trusted raoa family to tell me where to go !
i want to keep my total cost around 200ish not including hotel stay or food and to stay around ohio northern kentucky western west virginia eastern indiana southern michigan areas .
whoever gives the idea that we decide to try will get 15 worth of item s off their wishlist !
i 've got an 8 kilo turkey ‘brining ' ala nigella and a gammon joint soaking i do n't like the salty ness .
at least 10 of them i do n't particularly like so i guess being stuck in a kitchen is not the worst that could happen ?
before i buy i 'd like to ask some questions .
firstly i 'm a huge fan of the souls series and titles like salt and sanctuary .
however i 'm not a big fan of rougelikes and metroidvanias .
to me it feels like i can only get so far and that i do n't make that much progress .
with metroidvanias i 'm bad at finding things/back tracking is kind of boring .
i picked up enter the gungeon a while back and while i loved the game and its artsyle i just stopped because i could n't unlock the checkpoints and i could n't get past the third or so floor .
same goes with binding of issac as the farthest i got was to the devil on a really lucky run .
what progress do you make after runs and how good '' do you have to be to make progress and beat bosses although i should be significantly better at this then gungeon cuz i 'm not so good with bullet hells ?
basically i 'm worried that i wo n't be able to progress because i have to start a new run each time i die to a boss and that the new run requires me to go through all the bosses and floors i 've beaten already .
i 'm too used to shady practices from ea and the recent era of no communication after a product is released see destiny battelrite .

i 'm a coinbase user and before the frenzy of these days i opened a ticket for suspect hacking as i had an outgoing transaction in coinomi wallet which i did n't authorize and i wanted to check the eth address in coinbase to see if the transaction was directed to that address..
but that address had a loading bug so i opened the ticket .
what i received was an automate response that said my account was locked for my security and to answer the mail when i 'd be sure the account was safe .
i answered the same day as i found out that the problem was on coinomi and was also already resolved .
from that mail nobody never answered my account is still locked from the 07/12 and i have money to send to my wallet !
is there any way to contact some living person of the support to just unlock my account ?
my only thought would be to get a cheap router with wps capability and set it to the same ssid and password as my main network .
connect it via wps and then turn that router off and the client device should connect to the existing access points ?
however i 'm not sure if that 's how a wps connection operates or not .
my assumption is that connecting and reconnecting acts as normal and that wps is simply a way to bypass ssid password authentication .
if you are a regular trader you can disregard this i 'm breaking it down for newbies .
if you were n't aware most traders do not use usd or eur to measure the current price of their alt coins they use btc pairings in the markets which only shows the price of their alt coin in relation to the current price of bitcoin .
currently eth for example is trading at 0.047 btc .
what that means is that one eth is worth 4.7 of a bitcoin .
let 's say a bunch of traders put in sell orders '' at 0.055 btc 0.060 btc 0.065 btc etc. so they can take some profits when eth hits new all time highs and then we start lowering the price of bitcoin .
it 's going to start systematically triggering all of those limit orders for everyone using the btc pairing regardless of the price of eth at the time .
massive selloffs like that cause the price of eth to lower and continue to go down as btc goes down triggering sell orders along the way .
you can use that same example with any alt coin as they all have btc pairings .
the only way around that is to use a different measurement to decide on the price of alt coins .
as of right now a majority of traders use btc as that measurement so this will continue to happen everytime btc price changes .
when you see a sea of red next time btc is down do n't panic and freak out like the world is ending .
just remember that all alt coins are currently linked to the price of btc until traders start using a different measurement .
i see that ripple has extremely fast transaction rates compared to other blockchains bch ether btc etc etc ... but is this because ripple is currently centralized ?
wo n't the transactionspeed suffer once ripple becomes more decentralised.. ?

i 've enabled cloud sync both in game and in the steam client opened and closed both multiple times and actually have the little syncing saves '' message whenever i exit the game .
and yet i do n't have my laptop saves on my pc
i do n't want to manually copy the saves folder whenever i switch

now i 've started playing against only cheaters in mm .
it 's really sad that it went this far .
i had to make a new account and surprisingly i 'm only facing legit players .

yeah in all honesty this case i bought an moc and bunker and 1 fully upgraded rh8
i then proceeded to gain over 40mil soon after the cannon glitch .
and i wasted all that money on everything besides the cars i had which i still want but now i 'm grinding away at normal stuff for money ... rockstar gave a special promotion for me to buy an mc and then do 3 mc missions for 500k bonus money ... however it costs much more than that to even start lol
such a lame move by r at least give me 2 mil or something let me get more than what i paid to start it or what 's the point ?
i also got a loading screen message today about my account having money managed by r because it was glitched and if it happens again i could lose my account and stuff ... fair enough because i pretty much got all the crazy stuff i want lol now i can just play normally with treats every now and then like buying a lambo each time i get enough

you have not defined it you have compared it to another phrase .
actually if you looked it up you could find a definition for a hate train too .
the reason i asked you is because i did and they do n't compare like you think they do .
i want you to type out what you think a hate train '' is tell me how its applicable to this situation and now i 'm honestly curious how you think it compares to a karma train '' .

fortunately it 's extremely hard to rig an election in this country .
our elections rely on thousands of independent entities to count votes and certify totals and on top of that you have tens of thousands of people both citizens and foreign nationals including representatives from the organization of american states who observe our elections to make sure the votes are recorded fairly .
falsifying vote totals here is n't totally impossible but it 's really really really hard to do .
what 's relatively easy to do in this country is hijack the narrative and make people think an election is fraudulent and i fully expect the russians will pull out all stops in 2018 to do just that .
you 're gon na see both rose twitter and the alt-right posting all kinds of shit that supposedly proves '' the election is rigged ... do n't fall for it .

that 's not really something i can do but if this is more than just a sarcastic comment there 's a whole industry based off of analyzing charts and it 's more than possible to make high probability educated guesses .
i would definitely recommend looking into it even if it 's just slightly interesting to you cause there 's a lot to be gained from even the basic knowledge .
i did n't mean to say that everyone should be trading their btc everytime the price moves up 500 just that if there is a strong overall trend it 's ridiculous to continue with this hodl mindset .

this poly/open relationships start with transparent communication and set boundaries .
they entered another relationship before talking to you about it .
it 's a betrayal to you and the relationship .
betrayal can also happen in poly/open relationships i hope you do n't think that this can be a quick fix to her cheating on you .
if you want this you must also ask yourself why you 're willing to do this ?
how do you feel about being in an open relationship ?
you considering it for the sake of her experiencing other things because she did n't really date much is not a convincing excuse to be ok with her sleeping with other people it 's a lifestyle that only works when both people genuinely and truly are into it .
in successful poly/open relationships there are boundaries set that are respected by both partners transparency and constant communication some may think otherwise .

at rush hours the intersection of coburg and robie is very busy and frequently backed up here to seymour especially when there is a bus stopped there just past where this barrier is .
now factor in pedestrians crossing at the robie and coburg intersection a very busy pedestrian crossing .
the left turn lane only gets 1 or 2 cars through every light cycle due to pedestrians and traffic .
now the currently straight lane which in this proposed park idea becomes a straight and turn right lane .
now we run into the situation where only a couple of cars can get through either lane per light .
anyone going straight no longer has a clear go and has to wait for the people turning to get out of the way .

i really could need a 4 hero lineup to work towards to atm to beat the campaign .
kind of lost '' as to what to do .
im sure its because im new and i have to fully wrap my head around the game first but still i dont wan na blow any chances i currently have on heroes that wont help me progress .

after richard nixon left office congress passed a statute stating that a sitting president can not directly fire a special investigator .
that 's because being able to fire such an investigator would allow for a gross abuse of power .
that is congress by statute may limit removal powers of the executive as long as the limitation is limited to an office where independence from potus is desirable e.g .
such special investigations are under the doj which is part of the executive branch .

something to help filter the bad attitudes and help find the people that make the game a real good time .
maybe some things the dev 's can consider going forward ? ...
toxic players were and are a problem they feel they have no check or repercussion and the worst in themselves comes out unfiltered .

i do n't think bitcoin is ever going to have a global impact like the real estate crash of 2008 it seemed sketchy to me from the get-go more like the dot-com bubble .
wow i have their app which is honestly my favorite app after reddit that i do n't feel like i use enough .
not so obvious to 90 of the game 's playerbase .
it is super good advice to be remembered at all times in all games .
good to know you 're consulting with someone better .
if you ever buy something at costco and the price goes down return the old one even a year of two later and exchange it for a new one .
i used to feel guilty but they literally encourage this .
madrid should 've put this away in the first half oh well
from what i 've seen he just got out of the mold of dbfz .
while many of the other characters just rock a complete rushdown style he does n't seem like a very good brawler .
you could say he plays like he acts in the source material patiently waiting for their opponent 's actions before his own and that could actually be good/great for learning .
he also seem like a very grounded character so that might cut you some slack from getting overwhelmed from aerial movement and you 'll even borrow some experience of footsies of those other games you played .

a discussion of god in platonism would probably focus on the necessary attributes of god .
platonists would assume the necessary attributes are universal and there is an ideal universal form of godness but this clearly is n't the case since there are widely differing mutually exclusive claims about what god is .
i could say the same about the shape of the earth tho .
some people think it 's round others think it 's flat .
so clearly there is n't a necessary and universal shape of the earth .
otherwise why are there widely differing and mutually exclusive claims about what the shape is ?
there i kinda disagree with you there is a shape of a circle .
i have to be honest tho and i kinda missed your other explanation ?
but my intuition is that there is such a thing as a circle .
but i feel like if there are no circles in the whole universe and if no one is thinking of a circle anywhere in the world do circles still exist ?
it 's like that thing if a tree falls in the ground in a forest and no one hears it does it make a sound ?
i mean us philosophers could argue all day that chairs do n't exist .
maybe there are cases in which it 's hard to see if something 's a circle or not .
actually now that i think about it if the circle did n't objectively exist as possibility how could we ever think about it ?
sorry that i did n't understand your last examples .
half this sub is on a 2minute delay and it 's confusing the fuck out of me
i agree with what you 've said to a point and i am a little biased being that tl is my favourite team and piglet was my boy but with that said he was nothing like gg .
gg was a waste of time energy and resources .
he was nothing but below average the whole time he was on tl .
piglet was a great player and was always a top three na adc since his inception .
people seem to only look at his off games which really sucks as when he did go off he really really did pop off .
there was a period where i believed matt and piglet were easily top 2 bottom lanes na if not no .
1 and it did show before matt went mega tilt mode for a few months .
really sucks to see him go as i 've watched him for so long and followed the org since curse .
i believe the quas and piglet era was easily one of the strongest teams this org has had .
yeah i realised that when the video was uploaded and thought to take it down but it was already getting views so i did n't

but provided nobody takes a stance you could in 10 years use this nonsensical argument that yea but 60 eur games work with lootboxes if you 'd remove them now they 'd break ! '' .
gwent can definitely be made without the random loot and just fair in game currency that can be earned and can be used to purchase exactly that what you pay for .
i understand that you think it 's arrogant to repost .
but i really did not agree with this post getting locked previously .
so i did the exact same thing i did before i try to have the debate flow again through one means or another .
i remember seeing this on game grumps of all places .
science is studying the obvious '' things because you want future data and the accompanied conclusions to be well-founded .
conflict exist between people who are even very similar and come from similar backgrounds .
let 's create a hypothetical scenario we know the world of 2138 that momonga comes from his shit and lets say instead of logging out herohero stayed with him and was transported to the new world in the same time frame .
in this hypothetical scenario momonga is happy to have a friend with him but is still curious as to if the other supreme beings made it over with them and begins to work to find this out similarly yet slightly different to what we know already .
on the other hand herohero is relieved to not have to go back to his high stress job and slightly overwhelmed by the god-like admiration that he inspires within not only solution epsilon and the homunculus maids he created or had a hand in creating but the rest of the npcs as well the general relief of this world and being waited on hand in foot begin to sink in .
now still speaking in hypotheticals momonga sets out a operation to spread the name of nazarick to the world to help find other players and possible supreme beings but consults herohero on how he feels about this herohero has grown lazy as a god to these beings he sees no reason why he should have to worry over things and leaves all the work to momonga after seeing momonga general sway and use of npcs he used to use for his own whims being forced out to do things other than wait on him herohero slowly begins to undermine momongas plan realizing he does not want to share this power with anyone else .
thus leading to a civil war or out right back stabbing of momonga .
granted in this scenario i have not accounted for all things just a general quick if this happened maybe scenario .
do i want ainz to find other supreme beings in the new world .
honestly it depends on how they are written in and what they contribute to the writing do i think he would have meet a few players and supreme beings in the original 50 plus books worth of ideas the author said he had ideas for yes but we will probably never know .
interesting that you do n't like the display case back .

that the husband/boyfriend who has no history of being violent must have been abusive and either killed the person in question or is the reason they ran away .
it is suggested way too much often with very little if any evidence to back it up .
rarely is the female partner/spouse suspected of being abusive though .

unfortunately this might work exactly like that people show up sit down start to discuss what they want enter arguments difference in opinions .
this is exactly the situation where session zero is the most important .
if the players have such varied expectations that they would spend an entire session arguing about it would you rather you discover it upfront during the first session ?

that 30k restriction is preventing that big mover from killing the market instantly .
these exchanges can not afford to actually cash out all the bitcoin they have .
think of it like this if i give you 10 for a bitcoin and then 1 second later its now valued at 20 how do you pay me if i want to exchange it 1 second after that ?
this is why people are saying it 's ponzi scheme .
you need to funnel money into the exchange to have the big movers be able to cash out .
in our previous example if i convince someone to buy 20 in coin you well you still have the 10 i gave you initially and i get to cash out my 20 .
well i was the same but the btc transaction costs are crazy now .
i have a variety of crypto but mostly in eth .

last time i got it cut short was just before i started high school .

when i saw a ton of other boys with long hair i started growing it back immediately it was fully grown again by the end of the year and it 's been like that ever since .
i feel my long brown locks are who i am .
but that is because i can only go afternoon and i go every day .
i do n't focus on either gi or no-gi i just want to learn by rolling as much as i can .
yeah they work nicely to get accustomed to the game but warn them the combat tutorials are harder than actual combat in the game !

i would think the insurance company would require the moat then .
it 's tough to say why it is but here 's how it looks to me after reading here religiously for about 2.5 years .
most ll '' men do n't have low libidos .
they do n't want to fuck their wives and are sexually satisfying themselves in their preferred ways through masturbation and/or cheating .
so it 's not a problem with their sex drive but rather their sexual preferences and those are unlikely to change .
when ll women stop wanting to fuck their husbands they are more likely to have lose interest in sex in general .
so it really is a problem with their libido .
if their sexual interest can be rekindled they want their husbands again .
also hlfs appear to be more likely to leave the relationship than hlms .
for one thing hlfs mostly know they can easily find a new partner while many hlms are so beaten down that they believe no other woman would want them .
so hlms hang in there longer trying to fix the relationship .
that 's the very simplified version as i see it .

i woke up on monday and decided to max out at 1 singular drink if any at all at night .
i 've now cleaned my house gotten to work on time folded.laundry played games with my kids and talked rationally to the boyfriend about everything .
i have no idea why i was doing what i was and it just embarrasses me .

but i 'm not sure which is the right one i 'd guess the ciggiesworld.ch would be the fake on out of both of them .
somtimes you can get things through customs without duty but somtimes you have to pay .
i do n't know where they are coming from .
the this post https www.reddit.com/r/cigarettes/comments/6p9xu2 would indicate that some of them are coming from the uk as they are the old pre plain packaging health warnings .
i just read this and wanted to give a review .
for those that do n't know iclassics is an iphone app that adapts the work of various authors such as poe wilde and lovecraft with vivid and detailed illustrations as well as an engaging soundtrack .
their first ilovecraft collection was comprised of 'the hound ' 'the window ' and 'dagon ' and i quite enjoyed it .
they recently released a sequel titled ilovecraft2 which is comprised of only one lovecraft work although the worm in question is 'the colour out of space ' a relatively long work .
i quite enjoyed their rendition of a lovecraft classic to be honest and they built up the atmosphere quite well with the soundtrack and alien depictions of the changing landscape surrounding the gardener house .
the work cost £2.99 on the uk apple store so i think that 's about 4 ?
despite the cost i think it was worth it and would recommend it to any lovecraft fans who want to retread 'the colour out of space ' with a unique immersive feel to it .

my name is dwayne and first i 'd like to thank you for your time .
to put this bluntly i 'm raising money because i need help with making sure my dog gets better .
this holiday season my fiancee and i noticed that king our dog was limping really badly and even refusing to put weight on his leg in the first place .
needless to say since we noticed this the day prior to payday we scheduled an appointment to get him looked at .
now we had budgeted for this visit and a rough estimate as to what it would cost to get him medications or other remedies however we got blindsided by the sheer cost and duration of his recovery along with the cost of the medications for this time roughly two months .
we 've paid all that we can however there 's still more to pay just for the bare minimum cost of care .
we still need to pay for his x-rays to see if its a major or minor break we still need to buy seven more weeks of medications and we need to start setting aside money for a potential surgery .
my so and i have done all that we can to try and pay this off ourselves however we are out of options without outside help .
we 've pushed back our wedding plans we 've sold nearly everything that has remote value that we own aside from the bare necessities but it has n't been enough .
i apologize for this sad news in the peak of the holiday season but we do n't have any more places to go neither of our families will help we do n't qualify for the pay off in installments '' plan that our vet offers and it kills me inside listening to him whine all night because he 's in pain and ca n't get comfortable .
i just want to get him better and for that i need help .
the only people who are spanish are those from spain .
constantly i hear people using it as a race .
last time i checked not many spanish people lived in north america .
these people are referring to south and central americans as spanish .
the people they refer to are mostly mestizo a mix of european and indigenous blood from years race mixing during colonial times .
when people say hispanic it 's the same thing .
there 's black hispanics white hispanics and mixed white black indigenous hispanics .
hispanic is a person from a spanish speaking nation of any race .
it 's more accurate but they tend to think that pure black or white people ca n't be hispanic .
worse is when it 's to do with black people .
people that are obviously black are n't seen as being of african origin or black but spanish '' .
my girlfriend was telling me about her sisters boyfriend and said he was spanish .
i looked and he had the black type of hair the lips etc .
i told her that he 's black and she seemed so confused .
the sad part is that some black hispanics especially from dominican republic hate being referred to as black .
look at people like david ortiz ronaldo ronaldinho juelz sanata etc .
i was in an abusive relationship that lasted about a year .
he told me he did n't find me attractive .
he said he would marry me one day if he decided he did n't want anything exciting '' .
he told me i was his end goal '' and that he just needed to mature .
it was all very manipulative but it ended in me being crazy about him .
i used to write him notes and draw him pictures during class .
i signed myself up for secret santa got a stranger a gift but in my likes and interests '' i wrote about everything that he liked so that he could have an extra present for christmas .
i would have trouble falling asleep when we were apart because i did n't want to miss a text from him asking me to come over .
it 's over now i know that it was abusive but i ca n't help but feel like i will never love someone with the intensity and passion that i loved him .
i do n't know if i could ever love someone who is n't abusive .
i do n't know if i 'll ever meet someone who makes me feel so on top of the world .
i am afraid of feeling almost in love with someone else and settling .
is it possible that my brain is n't made to love in a healthy way ?
biggest secret i will go days not eating intermittent fasting and plan my meal windows around guys that i hope to fall for so that i might associate them with that rush of endorphins and fall for them .

ebay pinterest etsy and some other sites have many people listing these items as 'depression glass ' or 'vintage depression glass . '
someone went so far as to speculate that the numbers on some of the items corresponded with the year that they were produced .
youtube has an ad for the fortecrisa line of glassware dating to the early 1980 's .
does anyone know when this line of glassware was originally produced ?
so lbry has sparked my interest after signing up and forgeting about it for a while it was buggy and laggy last time i visited .
is lbry supposed to be something like youtube or twitch ?
if so i think it will help a lot and make navigating it easier if there was a categories section .

so i have been told that livestreams are great for channels because they bring in quite a bit of viewers .
making as many playlists as possible is also great because there 's no harm in making them .
now keeping livestreams is also a must because it 's something that 's up that takes no more effort in terms of editing and such .
i 'm wondering if i should put my livestreams in playlists or not .
the reason being when i livestream i tend to play other game modes in between the main series or at the end i 'll switch games completely .
how can i put a livestream into a playlist when it switches games ?
should i end my streams whenever i switch games or should i just not put them in playlists ?
it 's nitpicky questions i know but i 'm just curious as to what you guys all do .
i 've read in a few places that the gti comes with a drawer under the drivers seat .
however in the 2016 gti autobahn edition it does not seem to have this storage .
is it removable and when it was sold back to the dealership would someone possibly taken it and sold it ?
the exact model of my car is a us 2016 gti autobahn edition with the performance package and 6 spd manual

i never heard of this designer before until i was gifted this fragrance by my girlfriend for christmas ... and i 'm very impressed !
is a fragrance that does n't really suit it 's name .
would 've been a much better fit as this is a soothing blend of vanilla patchouli woods and spices .
longevity is amazing 10 hours with moderate projection throughout .
has anyone else gotten their nose on this yet ?
i 've been talking with folks involved with the process .
one who knows as he is involved at upper levels has told me that fema is spending 6 million per day .
you can see fema and contractors flowing through the airport constantly .
as usual with any government agency i 've wirjed wildland fires before it took them a whil3 to get momentum justblike a big ship .
my friend is doing house inspections for a contractor .
he 's working 12 hour days seven days a week most weeks .
one contractor doing oil and fuel supplies and repairs in different stuff called cat 5 has over 500 trucks here .
con edison has iirc over 50 electric repair trucks .
in the meantime undereducated idiots are defacing walls with stencils saying in spanish fema is the disaster .
maxed it out and it feels like 50 vertical .
i can not play any game with a restricted console style fov .
so with everything going on in my last post from today i just felt like sharing a unicorn that just came in .
this couple is here visiting the dad because he 's undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital and they had roaches in the last historic '' motel these local motels have been open for about 100 years and are awful i 've stayed at the one they 're talking about so they left .
very friendly and sweet couple with a little service pet have n't heard a peep from the pet since they went to visit her dad .
they come downstairs and she has some boxes and she comes up and asks if i 've ever had a hispanic dessert .
i told her a few because my aunt is from puerto rico so she makes alot of hispanic foods at family gatherings i love her food .
so she hands me a box and says i 'm going to love this it 's an almond boxes dessert called delaviuda turron blando .

fans spin up but no leds turn on on the mobo .
i have tried reseating the gpu memory and cpu and i checked all connections to the board .
i think the mobo might just be doa but i wanted to get additional opinions .
edit just to clarify the psu and gpu were in the old build so they should n't be the problem .
he 's been a as far as i know healthy scratch a bunch of times since he got to phoenix .
is it just that they 're trying to lose games/develop the young guys ?
not trying to push my views or anything but i 'm just trying to understand society 's reasoning behind it .
just to pose a simple example if a woman is given large breasts it 's viewed as being overly sexualized .
but if it 's a shirtless guy with bulky muscles they do n't receive that same label .
both can be arousing to the opposite sex but seemingly it 's only an issue when it 's a man being aroused by a woman .
to me in both instances it 's a case of unrealistic '' expectations for physical appearance and should be treated equally .
and if i had to try and answer my own question i can only guess it 's because woman are viewed as being more vulnerable .
and if it 's a man 's eyes preying on a woman she 's just seen as a victim .
if anyone wants to give me the tour i 'd appreciate it .

i 'm going to be giving up my tank .
the fish i have left are getting a little big for the tank i have and i do n't have the space to do a bigger tank .
i have a standard black placo that is about 10 '' long .
a green terror cichlid that is about 6 '' inches .
he can eat a ton if you give it to him .
he 's 5 or 6 '' with big pincers .
he 's bright blue and will shed his shell from time to time .
he eats algae wafers or small fish if he can catch them .
you would have to be reasonably close to litchfield county if you want to take them .
i want them to go to a good home so you also would have to already have an established tank .
i have a nice sun sun canister filter high end heater bubbler as well as tank accessories .
everything is free so long as i know they will be taken care of .
i live in toronto and can not find them anywhere !

hey the ps4 had this same exact problem but does anyone know of a website where i can see what is on the xbox store and at what price ?
the official xbox website is a complete abomination and i 'm not a huge fan of navigating the xbox store on the console although most of the time i just want to browse at work etc so ca n't use the console .
also the xbox app is beyond useless for browsing games to buy .
i 'm just looking for a simple list where i can see the deals etc .

i just won a solo round but did n't quit the game immediately because i took a screenshot and posted it on discord .
when i came back i got the message that the game kicked me to the lobby .
just a warning to you lot and bluehole pls fix .
it would n't be too hard have people select whether they have a mic or not or check whether they use the mic in games and have a vote system for other players to vote whether the person actually is using a mic .
you ca n't just match people together who are just the same rank if people are n't communicating it does n't matter how high individual ranks are you are n't going to win
if people want to play the game without mics thats fine but it 's really depressing when you want to play and win and no one is speaking except one person with a mic so muddy you can barely hear a single word .
tldr please add an option to only play with people who use mics and make it self curated so that if enough people vote in separate games you will be put in groups with people who do do n't use mics to prevent people just saying they use mics when they do n't
edit a better option would be a setting before queueing for matchmaking to only queue with those who use a mic which would hopefully be people who tick that box
as i mentioned in another post i will be in germany for 2 weeks .

a conservative friend of mine once told me that liberals were much less accepting than conservatives .
when a party refuses to allow people who have made mistakes at least publicly to be in leadership you now have a party run by liars .
someone who has made mistakes learned from them and changed is preferable over someone who is hiding theirs or does n't even acknowledge them .
we are all real people we want a party run by real people and we want to vote for real people not this false vision of holier than thou perfection that just makes us intolerant .
the queens all did pretty well in their documentaries '' with mimi akashia and serena being the standouts .
all of them really nailed at least one aspect so it was pleasant to watch to an extent .
after the queens walked the runway in their own style infused drag ru started the judging panel .
after watching your behind the queens videos i 've made some decisions .
your stunningly visual movie in connection with pure innocently funny humor captivated me !
serena chacha comedy is probably your strongest suit this season and i 'm proud to say i 'm proud of you !
you 're safe you may join honey in the back of the stage .
mimi imfurst you came in did your thing and slayed as expected .
akashia this season you 're a force to be reckoned with but will you fall for being the second best yet again ?
mimi imfurst condragulations you 're the winner of this week 's challenge !
mimi did a little victory dance on the stage .
both of you may join the other girls . ''
akashia gave mimi a hug and left the stage with her .
'' i 'm kinda bitter '' she said in the confessional .
'' i 'm always missing out on the wins and there wo n't be many more chances to slay .
i think that michelle 's made it clear in the past stop relying on that body but also on that face .
i 'm sorry my dear but you 're up for elimination .
'' i 've put a lot of work into this and to bomb so hard is really shitty .
the princess even though your video was n't the weakest you got majorly overshadowed by the grand personalities .
nicole paige brooks your dry humor really resonated well with me but everything else fell super flat .
nicole paige brooks i 'm sorry my dear but you 're up for elimination .
however because you still can use your immunity earned in the probation zone do you think it 's time to do so ? ''
nicole seemed to have her mind made up straight away .
sooo do you think the decision really is that easy ?
i 've been following all news about infinity war and i came to one conclusion .
we 'll never know or even understand how this will end .
josh brolin saying thanos will not finish the gauntlet in infinity war yet feige says the two movies are separate .
feige/russo saying that wakanda battle in not the third and final act what élise could we have ?
the different footage from sdcc and the trailer are confusing about when and where and who will fight thanos and what team ups we 'll have .
the infinity stones themselves at play especially the time stone leave the door open for endless possibilities..
my karma is about the same i think but some of my older posts suddenly have been getting downvote .
when i looked again the older posts were back at their original values .
this might be an unpopular opinion here but the whole point of me applying to us universities is getting a better and affordable education without ruining the four years of my life .
too many students from my country have gone to us applying to state schools with 99 acceptance rates yes 99 just because they wanted to enter the country .
and i do n't know one case where they went on to have great jobs or even a better life than what they could 've had in their own country .
they 're attracted to us so much that they ruin their lives basically .
the second part here might apply to us students too .
the whole point of going to college is to get a good education and come out a better person .
so what 's the point if you 're gon na be depressed for 4 years ?
what 's the point if you 're gon na regret going to college at all ?
if you 're going to a place where you think you do n't belong to then a year 's gap wo n't hurt .
in my case i 'm willing take a two year gap if that means going to a good college .
my ecs are n't great and if i lose this year i 'll do a couple of internships and join a few programs and will be ready for next year .
live the rest of your life in debt and with a shitty job or wait a little more to achieve what you want .
this post probably does n't apply to 90 of us people as you 've got great state schools for safeties but for those of you who it does apply to and the internationals do give it a thought .

am i the only one who has an so who out of laziness does n't do something really important ?
a little backstory we took our 7 month old off my insurance to put on to my boyfriends .
we found out that she was dropped from mine a month before i thought she was supposed to be so we 've been rushing getting her onto his so she still has coverage especially because we 've both been sick with bronchitis this year .
well everything was fine i thought she was all signed up until i found out from my boyfriends mom that we needed a particular paper from my insurance saying when she was dropped .
like my boyfriend did n't even tell me this very important piece of information so i could take care of it i found out from his mom .
so i get the paper last wednesday and send it to him and now all we have to do is send payment and she 's covered !
i just asked him where we stood on that and he has still not sent the payment in for literally no reason .
she 's already been without insurance since the end of november what the hell ? ?
ugh sorry for the rant but that just really started my christmas eve off poorly .
you would think that a battle against molag bol would be amazing but nah .
the lead up to the final battle had nothing that really stood out bar the death either
i actually really regret doing that as a fun story ended on a sour note .
at least i got my skill point but blegh .
at least the coldharbour quests leading up to it were mildly amusing .
i understand that combo in mania does n't help and its all about high acc .
how can i have higher combo than those on the top scores .
should n't they have a higher combo than me since they hit everything perfect ?
the long awaited english fan translation of super famicom wars thanks to u/optiroc has just been released https www.romhacking.net/translations/3354 !
almost 20 years after its original japanese release the immediate ancestor to the beloved turn-based tactics game advance wars super famicom wars is finally playable in english .
the game has been fully translated and made playable wholly in english .
when mining the rom some unreachable content has been found which from the looks it is mostly related to debugging and internal playtesting .
some but not all of these things have also been translated .
the patch has been tested on japanese european and american snes/sfc hardware using the sd2snes and super everdrive flash cartridges .
it should also work on most emulators and has been confirmed working via canoe on the snes classic mini .
this is the first public release and while it has been in internal testing for several months it is extremely unlikely that not a single bug or inconsistency has flown under our radars .
please refer to the readme for information on how to submit bug reports and for further details on the translation .
i recently made this cake called a kladdkaka from a recipe that i found on reddit here https www.reddit.com/r/gifrecipes/comments/77sr7c/swedish_sticky_chocolate_cake_kladdkaka
in the comments section there are a couple of people who recommend adding a shot of coffee .
though i 'm not sure what the best way to do so would be .
should i add just add some instant coffee powder in with the flour and cocoa powder ?
or should i brew a cup of coffee let it cool and then add it in at what stage should i do so if that is the correct way to do it ?
also how much should i use in both cases ?
edit the coffee powder that i 've got comes in little 6 gram sachets and the instructions say that one sachet makes 4 cups .
i have belt with 20 increased life recovery rate ''
i have zealoth 's oath so i regenerate 2 of es instead of life
the question does 20 increased life recovery rate '' has any effect on 2 regen ?
i am a young guy in my 20s and i find myself excessively angry for quite a bit of time now and i could use some advice friends .
this has happened just too much and the problem is that some of the offenders are relatives .
this used to happen on a daily basis so i cut them off on a 90 basis retaining a bit because of relations
because of 1 2 it has gotten to the point where i get angry if someone even gives me an odd stare .
the rage i feel burns in me and stays for a few hours and sometimes even days eventually causing me to doubt myself doubt the future and just about every other thing .
it has caused me to cut off a lot of relationships and to be alone quite a bit of time .
the few times that i did bring this up to some people backfired causing them to sometimes even turn on me true story .
i honestly want this to stop and to control this yet at the same time not at the expense of my integrity .
i have little hope that one day i simply wo n't be mentally sick anymore .
i do n't understand what i 'd be working for if not that and if i ca n't reach normal to the point of being on the same plane as everyone else it seems pointless to try at all .
i do n't even see the point in working towards almost-healthy-but-not-really .
i 'm two years out of school never having had a job and i ca n't drive .
i have thousands of halfway finished projects under my belt as well as a school career of slightly-above-average-but-still-mediocre grades .
there 's nothing about what i 've done already to make future progress easier .
there 's nothing about me that could possibly make future progress easier .
sure i 'm a high school graduate but most people graduate from high school .
i 'm lazy i 'm not good at any of my hobbies i have too many fears .
i mean i did n't even join any school clubs for longer than a month .
i had so many opportunities to do all the dumb teenager things everyone does like smoke weed or get drunk on someone 's parents ' alcohol yet i colored inside the lines because going outside of them was too scary .
any perceived risk was too much risk which is ironic considering i 've nearly starved myself to death and regularly eat sushi .
i have exactly two people i considered actual friends .
i have n't talked to either in months probably as a result of my tendency to suck up other people 's life force like cattails to water .
maybe i need therapy but i 've never liked what any therapists have had to tell me .
that desire to starve yourself into nothing is just ocd .
but i did take the medication and it made me feel empty and i 'll take sad but with many dumb ideas over an echo-box of a skull any day .
truth be told sometimes it felt like the implication was that i could n't have a bad thought because all bad thoughts were tied to some disorder or swatted away as being unimportant because other people like me '' manage to live happy lives yet i do n't so it must not be related to the problem i brought up but instead me .
given this i do n't know what to do so i simply do n't .
it feels like my brain is keeping a map and marking off all the ways i ca n't move .
or maybe it 's like the cage i let myself roam keeps getting smaller and smaller .
i can easily see myself dying before i get out if i get out and not necessarily because i tried to kill myself .
i 'm just not looking forward to much else anymore .
this is a very small and mostly inactive sub but if you happen to find yourself in r/creationpub here 's a little history .
creationpub was created at a time when r/creation was still private .
my goal with creationpub was to reproduce the news feed aspect of r/creation while comments and text posts could remain private .
i do n't remember the exact timeline but i believe less than a year later a reddit user made a script that scraped all of r/creation including comments and text posts and posted this content in r/creationexposed .
with it clear that r/creation could not remain truly private the sub was made public but read only .
anyone can view r/creation but only approved users can post and comment .
thanks for reading and feel free to post questions or send a private message .

i started taking bcp when i was a teenager to reduce my symptoms and bleeding i was not diagnosed back then .
it was a strong one and a few years ago i was 21 i stopped taking it slowly by cutting it into 3/4 then 1/2 then 1/4 ... .
i did this over six month but three months after my last little bit of pill all hell broke loose .
i stayed off the pill two years and almost died from the anemia i bleeded a full year without any break every inch of my skin was painful because of cystic acne my cramps were terrible my hair would not stop falling .
i decided to take a birth control pill again a little less strong than the one i had before it 's been a few month and i 'm slowly getting my skin hair and health back .
i was planning on taking the pill all my life because it 's the only way to live a somewhat decent life for me i tried everything else but my doctor says i have to stop taking it when i reach 35 years old !
how do i get doctors to prescribe it to me after this point ?

so if you see a plague doctor with a dragon-headed cane running around it 's probably me lol .
the third episode of life is strange before the storm came out a few days ago and i have n't seen jon mention it anywhere .
at the beginning of this year i decided to quit smoking again .
i started with gas station vuse 's and an icare and i just got done having my morning vape on a peerless se with dual quad core claptons sitting on a battlestar and i could n't have figured this stuff out for the life of me if it was n't for this sub .
thank you to everyone who contributes in the daily questions threads which i have utilized too many times to count thanks to the mods who keep this place in order and set up the amazing sale megathreads thanks to all the vendors with a presence on reddit that stay involved with their customer base thanks to u/mooch315 who i would n't have been able to dive into external battery mods without and everyone else who makes this community so helpful and welcoming .
always like agatha christie but looking for something more recent this time around .
so i take loestrin and never take the white or brown pills just the blue ones .
my mother says she notices emotional changes when i 'm supposed '' to be having my period but i think she 's just looking for something where there is n't anything .
does the negative feedback system with the hormones prevent cyclical emotional fluctuations ?
i am awake at 5am on christmas day and i just heard the bin truck go past .
edit just to say this was a sincere post thanking those who work on public holidays like the garbos .
i bought a friend the eod version of the game for xmas .
though in my absence of mind i was the liquor i bought the russian version .
i got the code emailed to me gave it to him .
he put the code in the activate key section and it worked .
but now he cant get the device id on his email .
through the insane amount of support tickets they have decided he didnt buy the game cause you know i gifted it to him ... .
problem when i sent it they said it was cropped '' and couldnt use it .
i 'm losing patience and about to send them a pitcure of my balls and just refund the thing and give him cash to do as he pleases .
if anyone went through this and has advice please .
nothing we can do to fix his email account getting mail from them .
i need to know how to fix the people at support for this game .
heya folks i 've borrowed my friend 's bass for a couple weeks directly after finding vulfpeck and i ca n't find a tab or notation for cory wong .
also if anyone minds what are the first songs you learned or found ?
china rework seems pretty significant creating new countries like the league of eighth provinces and clarifying the chinese civil war for the sake of greater plausibility .
italy is even more drastic imo flipping the ideologies of the previous two countries and adding several new ones .
what was the motivation of doing that anyway is it because logistically it just makes more sense having a revolutionary state adjacent to the commune of france ?
and maybe because syndicalism is more of an urban workers ' ideology instead of a peasant one ?
i wonder what will happen to any old memes involving the old monarchist italian federation and southern sri maybe there can be ghost old revision polandballs representing game concepts that have been written out of the current timeline .
had a competitive match yesterday where my partner said i have no idea what this guy is doing . ''
i 've had other matches where i feel like i have a good rhythm with my partner .
i 'm trying to figure out if i 'm rotating correctly or screwing everything up .
for context i 'm silver div 3 playing on a macbook pro using the keyboard .
i have a wife and children so i 'm not as good as a college student using a ps controller .
i can quick-double-jump and make contact with every aerial in the all-star practice but ca n't necessarily send the ball in the direction i want .
i 'm terrible at juggling and need to learn to wall-aerial but otherwise reasonably good .
i try to make up for this by being really good at rotating .
in my mind there are two positions forward and support .
if i 'm forward i 'm making a play on the ball and trying to center the ball for my support to knock it in or taking the opportunistic shot if i think i can .
if i miss a touch with the ball and end up forward of the ball my job is to flip-and-burn as quickly as i can back to a support role picking up a boost along the way .
if i 'm in support i try to see if anyone is about to knock the ball back hard to my side of the field .
if not i try to get in position to score off a pass .
if i 'm not playing well i 'm going to miss a lot which means i 'm going to be dropping back each time i miss .
but otherwise in my mind this is how you play .
if i 'm playing with someone who does n't know how to rotate the biggest mistake that happens is that the miss a dribble or a contact with the ball and try to recover by dropping back and making desperate hit again .
meanwhile i think oh they missed i better boost up and hit the ball while they fall back '' .
then we collide because we are both trying to make a play on the ball .
in this case i usually try to default to defense until i see them flip-and-burn back which is sometimes never .
i do n't remember how the game was going with this guy but i felt like there was no rotation we were constantly competing for the ball so i just started handing back and then he starts complaining about me over chat .
any advice on whether i 'm doing this correctly ?
do i have the concept of a doubles-rotation correct ?
i live in turkey idk if it counts as asia or europe
do the npc characters interact with the environment based upon what type of character they are ?
basically i know that some are hostile and attack other creatures/characters while some are friendly and will wave at the player .
but do they interact with the environment in any other way ?
such as if i place a few construction workers in a world will they start building stuff or if it does n't show them building things will buildings just start popping up ?
like are most people on est servers actually est ?
i 'm trying to find a new server to play on and all of the ones i want are the wrong time zone.. not sure if this actually matters .
i have a crapload of ul1015 24 red color wiring .
as well as other types that are 12 to 24 inches long .
had surgery 3 times to remove stones that would n't pass .
i heard squeezing half a lemon in luke warm water first thing when you wake up and drinking it before eating or coffee cures it .
since starting this i have n't had a stone in 3 years .
funny thing also is i was diagnosed with severe acid reflux 30 years ago and have suffered emensly over the years .
since starting the lemon drink my reflux has vanished .

i had a similar thing happen i bought a jacket that shipped from another country so my card had a hold put on it by my bank for a few days .
my first membership did n't go through and when i contacted rooster teeth support the response was basically sorry but you 'll have to pay the new price now '' .

they hacked t-mobile so who knows what information of mine they had .
except you are 2k and nobody should believe what you say .
at least the bucks are n't eliminated from playoff contention .
when the team made their next push and the enemy team dropped back to the point it would be covered in turrets and the possibilities are endless as to how it would 've gone .
they would hire him as an assistant equipment manager or something .
i think it 's more to do with brcokhampton sonically being completely different than anything else in hip-hop right now .
he definitely enjoys musical innovation and exploration which brockhampton have in spades even if you do think their rapping is on the weak side
yup much expected as it 's been on japan version for a very very long time .
please respond with done '' when complete so we can check this one off the list !
the most recent update was by zonic where he said that they would hopefully have dev1ce for the upcoming major '' .
i have never seen more emotion from snell than when bango slapped a venison burger out of his hands .
a few months ago i had gone to lunch with my girlfriend and her grandmother .
near the end of the cracker barrel meal no brad 's wife does n't work there anymore we were all still talking and out of nowhere the grandmother pulls out her credit card hands it to my girlfriend and says go ahead and pay for us two '' meaning gf and grandmother .
i was thinking that 's really nice of her not making me pay for three meals like i was expecting !
grandmother and i kept talking about her career and my upcoming plans .
next day i learned her paying was actually a test that i failed .
i was supposed to stop her and pay for all three .
grandmother became convinced i was cheap and tried to get my gf to break up with me .
my 2.5 yo son has autism and screams like i 'm hurting him when it 's time to brush his teeth .
👌🏻i thought🤔🤔 i 'd give🤗 it a🅰️ shot😲🔫💉 started then remembered how much i hate emojis .
not sure if disappointed or pleased to find out that the sites do n't exist .
yeah she an ugly ass bitch like i do n't know how her own mother could look at her face .
overwatch helps a lot but 3rd party anti-cheats are far superior .
i know they are more intrusive but atleast give people the option to opt in or make punishments worse .
punishing innocent babies for things that adults did is n't good in any way .
how do you know that your god is the right one ?
jesus muhammad krishna zeus there are hundreds of religions that people think are real .
do you think there all real or just yours ?
they might be spewing different dogma/agendas but they are the same .
as far as hillary do you recall why her emails were being investigated ? ?
because the poor bastard in benghazi emailed to evacuate the embassy like every other country did for their embassies and he was completely ignored by the state dept and hillary 's story was she ca n't keep up with all her emails and she was n't sure if she received any ?

the topic is notorious for being highly academic and mostly forgotten but the first book should lead you into the other three if you want to explore it further .
the ui is terrible tiny otherwise the game is great .
also it sucks you need to create another user for local multiplayer

i seem to remember it just allowing me the option i do n't recall doing anything special
he 's being a kind man and helping his community .
i do n't outwardly react but i do internally kinda hurumph .
on the other hand the general ineffectiveness of what happened with the supplies bought with that money got people to be a lot smarter with ngo funds .
it also got bono into more serious activism fwiw .
rift can do perfect roomscale for some time now .
i made this exact post and got shit for it thank you .
she once asked me why the sky was blue so i told her the scientific reason .
30 minutes later she tells me that she thinks it 's blue because it 's reflecting the ocean .
i think you are still missing the point but i also appreciate the effort .

why does candykeys have their leopold fc660c marked for pre-order https www.candykeys.com/product/fc660c-white-topre ?
does this just mean that they are receiving stock soon or this some new special version of the board ?
this version of lakers may be what i hate the most .
even this lakers team bad they annoying as fuck .
much more similar to a polish sausage than a frankfurter .
it 's a paid service that costs 10 usd i think .
why ca n't people admit that genetics are a thing ?
405k people in this sub 83k people in that one .
alt account have a roughly 50 profit after first month on initial investment in pure loyalty not even counting log-in rewards and much needed labor lordcoins library scrolls i 'm sure there is more i 'm forgetting .
but true sniping whatever fine lunarite ect at low cost is also easy gold but alts profits expantionally and it does n't end when you sell the goodies you hoarded early on .
best i could come up with was andre miller .
i honestly would have let it go if he had said something like toni parker who had a mid game but he was even underwhelming from the ft line when he was young .
hard to spend money on anything when everything is costs more and still saving for a house .
any more my response when asked how tall i am is how much do you weigh ? ''
it 's ok for a girl to objectify a man on a physical characteristic but not the other way around ?
bonus fun fact most of theses girls weigh more than a few extra pounds ''
it 's a brutal adaptation of the tryhard tourney longsword or red rust scimitar dragonslayer spear setup that you would probably see occasionally
they take account recovery and personal information changes really seriously .
yeah that can happen but that may not have been packed very well in the first place plus it 's christmas and the volume of boxes going through the postal service machinery is phenomenal .
i 've been receiving packages for decades and never seen a box that mangled .
so i think it 's fair to say this is very very rare .
i think the postal service does an amazing job 99.9 of the time anyway .
what you do n't say is what was inside it and whether or not it was damaged and that after all would be the key thing would n't it ?
really going all out with being a dumb homophobe there dummy
i 'm surprised she 's not looking for an outlet .
i 'm with you there that shield is awesome best one in game imo i like the tomb one too that you get for fighting god
looks like everyone is rooting for the packers tonight .
speed up lag is when the game then tries to catch up from the moments of lagging causing you to not be able to control the game as it goes 2x faster or more
just watching it now totally thought the girl would disappear and blame bull
had a winter coat from there that lasted for years and years .
i 've heard that you 're never supposed to turn a turtle around bc they know where they 're going .
if they always know where they 're going would n't it not matter that they 'd been picked up and turned around ?
i just posted this in a hurry i did n't actually think it would get this much attention hahah
you most likely want to contact the seller more about this issue .
chances are they got the names and addresses mixed up and the package you received was supposed to go to someone else that 's not even in bakersfield .
they should have a digital file of purchases made through their etsy etsy keeps track of buyer info and provides that info upon purchase .
it should n't be hard for the seller to match the name to the correct recipient and message them .
if you 're lucky you can simply ship each other what you were supposed to get .
possibly have the seller pay the shipping fees since it was their fault for the mixup .
no shit everyone knows you need to watch the rlm review too

i am guessing collinsworth is drunk and got the booze for free from packer fans
he has a crazed look that is pretty creepy .
the new map is temporarily at a higher chance of being the map of choice .
seriously everyone gets hard and goes crazy over the new map but now that we 're given enough time and opportunity to actually learn the ins and outs of it people bitch about it .
i 'm getting erangel at probably 1/10 games and that 's fine with me at the moment .
if richie is on your team you want a guy like that to walk in the bar with you or down an alleyway if goons are waiting for you .
i 'm in cbt and therapy already i mentioned above .
ironically i have a few more health issues that make taking medication not possible hence opting for cannabis instead .
i have never heard of progressive desensitization exercises ... extrapolate .
i have a lot of male friends but in fact only one is good with women and he 's actually the one who turned me onto rsd and all of this wonderful stuff .
they havent shown collinsworth and michaels since he said that ... coincidince ?
a few times i 've taken my shirt/sweater off .
she can transpose herself onto the magazine and look back ? !
try downloading live update 6 from msi it will download and install the newest bios over download instead of usb if i remember correctly
i had an uncle who taught wing chun he was a perfectionist and i think that discouraged a lot of his students but he would tell me there is a big difference between doing something with the correct technique and being close enough .
he did n't want to teach slop and that takes more time which most students did n't like .
he learned from a few different people and said the hardest thing about learning wing chun was unlearning what he previously learned before he found the correct way .
so he would probably tell you to find a good teacher so you do n't waste your time .
that guy is proven imo and the raiders would be dumb to get rid of him .

if we get one more touchdown i 'm ok with teddy coming out .
lol a 3 car accident on the freeway with airbags deployed is definitely 911 worthy .
yea i have been sending a lot but not recently since she told me to that sending her messages is n't helping and it 's making her more mad because of how nice i am to her .
when she is back in town from break or christmas maybe ?
i ca n't get over the irony that china manufactures the vast majority of christmas gifts ornaments even cards yet christians are not allowed to freely practice their religion within the country .
ya i 'm guessing the tool inside is the same for ca verses the us .
there was a guy on here a couple of weeks ago in mexico that had a tool that had a knife you could only open with two hands .
which is a modification some countries in europe require .
have heard great things about bonair diving but have n't made it over yet .
bought a place in aruba a few years ago and the dive shop is right next door .
i had a friend almost commit suicide because his gf got an abortion and he wanted the kid .
he was supportive through everything drove her to all the appointments and even paid for it but i could tell he was just dead and empty inside ever since .
the thread i use usually costs around a dollar it depends on how much thread you use and what quality you want as well .
hoops from michael 's and other craft stores are usually between 1 3 .
i would recommend getting one of those starter kits they have at craft stores that come with a small hoop little design thread and needle .
it also comes with a little guidebook usually on basic stitches .
projects generally vary in time given how intricate the design is and how fast your hands are .
when i throw something together it usually takes maybe a total of 2 5 hours depending on the design and my energy levels .
if you have any other questions feel free to reply to this !
hope you enjoy it as much as i do and i hope i helped .
okay i have to ask why so many taxis ?
you can go to times square and 99 of the cars are taxis .
in that one boss battle taxis still keep driving into the battlefield .
did someone on the team have a taxi obsession ?
there is no way to talk them out of their racism their doxing
their intolerance their retaliation against all of america their hatred against all success by americans .
at the top there are people saying 'good pede ... .good ... haha ... so good ... '' they are bound and determined to kill american competitive advantage .
that 's who i 'm talking about with cult db .
from the democrat side it does n't matter what race we are there 's too much shame and people who believe in '' shame as a way to motivate themselves or something
i 'm suspicious of anyone who picks sides '' today and tries to drive a nail between hiiiary and bernie or caters to the idea that one cheated the other .
find bernie 's interview with the u. conn huskies basketball team coach .
this is n't bernie 's bile being thrown around here .
this someone else who believes bile is the way to win '' and does n't see the unrealistic expectations when the candidates campaign simply did n't do all the work they needed to win .
some weird line-ups from brad but bulls are probably a good team to experiment with .
celtics defense was pretty suspect especially in the first half .
liked what i saw from bobby portis dude hustles and bangs .
he could be a nice bench guy on the celtics .
the stat alone is n't great without context but combined with the fact he 's also responsible for the most dropped points in the league due to errors over the last few years it 's clear he 's a pretty poor gk .
even with a shit defense consistently having such a low save percentage means he 's only saving the shots any gk is expected to save .
especially when over the last few years we 've conceded a relatively low amount of shots on target for such a shit defense .
people claim he is a good shot stopper '' but this is pretty damning .
his shot stopping is average at best for s premier league quality keeper .
along with the fact he 's weak in every other area of gking besides penalties it 's unbelievable he 's been with us for this long .
it was clear after the first year here mignolet was n't good enough .
i love this sub but you guys have a weird definition of 'evil ' .
most of this stuff is just cool futuristic/unorthodox design imo .
you will play the new map and by god you will like it !
make sure you have a sitter and do some research .
it 's banned in most if not all states .
i came across this image while surfing along and actuality signed up for this site to see more of you ! !

we need him to find himself in the worst way right now .
yeah hundreds of thousands marched on washington but mlk made it happen .

i 've been reading through a bunch of tutorials and posts but they are all to do with futurerestore ... which i 'm not using .
i opened up one of my blobs for 10.3.1 and scrolled to the bottom ... but i 'm not seeing any number that starts with 0x .
am i looking in the wrong place for the nonce i need ?
i mean hardly the only one but the disengagement from gaza https en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/israeli_disengagement_from_gaza was a big one .
the 3 dlcs each add a nice little region at a couple hours each if you want to 100 it all .
the odachi and tonfa are also apparently a dlc thing so there 's also that .
personally i would say aubameyang and ronaldo for goal scoring .
who has an expiring contact to match and needs a guy bad ?
if there is then yea it 's worth it but i do n't think that scenario exists and only trade we have is taking non expiring contract which is n't worth it
i think when you 're pres you often will end up enacting policy you personally disagree with .
how did you know what work i was avoiding right now ?
vegas goes into the christmas break first place in the west .
i think i picked this game up when i was 9 and did n't really understand the mechanics but i played for hours til i lost due to bankruptcy .
i bought the stark banner targaryen and lannister 😂 i 'm definitely doing this !
i own a 5dii and would rather shoot on my fuji x-e2 300 used than that decade old sensor in the canon .
you can use b/o in the title instead of price
example of a tab i have b/o 15 chaos misc .
as long as you establish a b/o in the tab name first you can have any combination of text afterwards .
to piggyback off your suggestion i have a few tabs with colours specifically mentioned in the tab names i.e .
b/o 5 chaos blue tab or b/o 40 chaos slate tab .
both are valid names for setting a b/o for the entire tab .
it 's 1 am here but the disc installation seems to be at an understandable pace so that 's a good start at least .
my favorite way to close out a game ... aside from twin and win of days past ...
to attune them you bring them to the set crafting station you want them to be .
if you do n't have a 3d printer a lot of libraries offer free 3d printing .
then just buy the required frames/prescription lenses for 9 https www.zennioptical.com/p/metal-alloy-round-eyeglasses/5500 ? skuid=550021 .

it 'd be inconvenient at the very least to try and reconcile the likes of ops coldstore and spectrum with the right to fair trial and due process not least because singaporeans do n't even understand basic concepts like separation of powers .
and how can anyone in government possess the moral authority to talk about fair trial or due process with a straight face given how these were suspended ostensibly in the interest of social order .

so the second thing i did after hanging out with the dog was switch off the ceiling lamp for the table lamps in my bedroom .
this confuses people who visit me back in nyc since they 'll turn on an overhead light then a few minutes later without thinking i 'll turn it off only to turn on a table lamp or something .

you need to call util.prompt_for_user_token only once you 're calling it twice first in line 5 with proper set of parameters you 're not saving the token .
you 're calling it again with the wrong set of parameters in line 12 and saving the token but since the parameters are n't proper the token is not saved and it goes else part .
move the line from line 5 to line 12 and save the result to token like how you 're doing in like 5 it should be fine after that

i think the better question is how does the falcon or tekka being on jakku lead one to believe rey has some special parentage ?

the british ended up giving that plot of land to the jewish in the region to start the country of israel .
it was created through the un 's partition plan for palestine '' which the jews accepted and arabs did not .
it 's lawful to kick people out of their land bulldoze their homes and destroy their way of life ?
they had been living there for countless year and as soon as the land was gifted to the jews the jews proceeded to remove them from their homes .
even if neighboring countries declared war how is it lawful to treat civilians like your enemy ?
it was britain 's land and they had the right to do with it as they wanted .
sure they do does n't mean it 's okay .
giving land to a people that proceed to oppress a people of a particular race and kick them out of their former homes to make room for yours sounds a lot like one of the un 's definition of genocide .
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part . ''
the palestinians fought a war of aggression and ended up losing it .
had they just accepted a minor loss of land they would not have lost so much territory .
but they should n't have to accept anything that directly damages them their people or way of life especially if they said no and are n't an active enemy or threat to anyone .
anytime someone just accepts '' it ends up just getting worse with large more serious demands .
there is a reason that appeasement does n't work .
they fought a war because the palestinians were going to be moved out of their land and all their old land was going to be given to a new group of people .
i really do n't see a point in continuing this conversation .

it 's not those specifically but the page this text is taken from has links to similarly long-lived microorganisms .
microorganisms living under these conditions have developed an extraordinary ability to limit their metabolism to a level that is best measured in geologic time .
most have the ability to remain viable at minuscule to negligible metabolic cost 1 .
it is because of this that the lines between life and death begin to blur .
some microbes remain metabolically dormant for such extended periods of time that is impossible to tell whether a cell is dead or just dormant .
many individuals tend to lose the ability to reproduce after significant periods of dormancy as well 1 .
it is because of these two facts that the classification of living '' or dead '' becomes a relative term when referring to deep subsurface microbes .

propagation times for blocks received by 50th percentile of all nodes
since 2013 block-sizes having increased by 4 times average block propagation times have decreased by more than 3 times .
it is true that block-sizes do have an effect on propagation times link http www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/49318d3f56c1d525aabf7fda78b23fc0/p2p2013_041.pdf but historical trends show that so far the bitcoin network has been able been able to scale more than at lleast 3 times faster than increases in blocksize .
concerning your point about it leading to higher orphan rates
according to orphan block data https blockchain.info/charts/n-orphaned-blocks ? timespan=all daysaveragestring=90 available at blockchain.info during 2014-2016 bitcoin had an orphan block rate of around 1 .
since bitcoin has already survived a long period with 1 orphan rate i 'm assuming that a 1 orphan rate is n't a problem .
considering the last date for with data is available on propagation times for at bitcoinstats 05/04/2017 http bitcoinstats.com/network/propagation/2017/04/05 the average propagation times for blocks reaching 50 of all nodes was 1.818s .
for propagation times of 1.818s you get an expected orphan rate of 0.30 http www.wolframalpha.com/input ? i=1+-+exp 1.818 2f600 in 25 which seems to fit well enough with available data regarding orphan rates at that time .
if we assume 1 to be an appropriate orphan rate we can have avg .
block propagation times of around 6.03s http www.wolframalpha.com/input ? i=1+-+exp 6.03 2f600 in 25 .
since block propagation times increase linearly with block-sizes other variables remaining constant bitcoin could have handled at least 3.19 mb 0.96 6.03/1.82 in april 2017 without increasing orphan rates beyond 1 .
if we follow nielsen 's law we could double that size every 2 years without it affecting orphan rates .
additionaly other improvements such as bip-152 and tools like matt corallo 's fibre has meant that orphan blocks are extremely rare now so i think that a high orphan rate should not be a concern in short-term or mid-term future of bitcoin even if block-sizes were to rise several times .

i 've been playing since january of this year and have been insanely impressed with the devs ' dedication to listening to player input and fixing bugs .
however there 's a huge issue that has probably existed since well before i started playing and still exists even in the stable builds fauna especially leviathans clipping through terrain .
i currently have a rabbit ray stuck in the wall of one of my bases and a ghost ray stuck in the alien containment of my lost river base .
he 's not in the actual chamber he 's stuck in the wall i can not move either of them with the propulsion or repulsion cannons or kill them with my knife .
i would have to deconstruct the whole room they 're stuck in and i 'd really rather not do that .
i also keep having peepers boomerangs and garryfish swimming right through my walls .
just earlier today i got to a very important and very deep part of the game .
i nearly lost my cyclops which most likely would have ended with me dead because one of the leviathans in the area was hidden in the terrain next to me .
i made a post recently about building a base in the caves under the mountain island which i thought was a cool idea because no aggressive creatures spawn there .
the reaper proceeded to clip through the whole mountain and grab me in my seamoth as i was leaving my base .
understanding the areas that the aggressive creatures are in and how to avoid them is incredibly important especially with leviathans .
this must be fixed it 's a huge problem .
it 's one of the best sandbox survival games i 've ever played .
i want it to be the best game it can be when it 's fully released .
devs please please make sure you fix this before release .
if this means you have to delay it more then delay it .
i do n't want your final product to be marred by such a consistent problem .
sincerely a loving fan who ca n't wait to get off this accursed planet !
please use this thread to discuss anything you 'd like !
i assume most of you stay at home just like me and there comes a times when you are not watching porn everything else is boring you do n't have the will to do anything else and you might consider relapse .
well i found out when i opened my windows to get a fresh air it actually helped me to calm down and feel better .
i tried this several times and it worked so i decided to google the benefits .
to sum it up they are good for digestion improves blood pressure and heart rate makes you happier this is very important !
the idea is you breath a used air indoors and when you get fresh air you get all the benefits listed above i encourage you to google the benefits of fresh air .
i hope my little advice helps you merry christmas and stay strong !
i saw the term league winner being thrown out for a bunch of players this season but a lot of them failed to live up to that potential .
who are some players that many people considered a league winner early on or in the last few weeks that simply did n't show up during the fantasy playoffs ?
for example one player that got hot late in the season was keenan allen .
many people on this sub were saying he would be on a lot of championship teams .
he may have helped a lot of teams sneak into the playoffs .
however in the last two weeks he only had 10 and 11 points in ppr .
that 's not too bad but it wo n't carry your team over the top and it 's definitely not league winner numbers .
forgive me if my definition of league winner is off but i 'm curious to see which players failed to live up to expectations during the playoffs .
is it that big of a deal to you to get 100 sync in ac ?
i like to get 100 because it makes me feel i accomplished something what about you ?
on behalf of the moderators for r/ashens i 'd like to wish you all a merry christmas and a happy new year .
may the tat be minimal and the food edible .
for those of you who find yourself in a tough place at this time of year please hang on in there as best as you can .

i 've just picked up a 2009 tiger 1050 after almost 10 years in a car and wanted to pick your brains on how to set it up to suit me better .
my last bikes were sports models yzf and cbr so a lot different to ride than this tank .
it already has oggy knobs dual usb ports heated grips trickle charger and a set of proper triumph side panniers .
i 'm getting a bar mount for an ios device for gps shortly .
i 'm feeling like it 's a tiny bit high.. like i have to scoot over a bit to comfortably put my leg down when stopping .
can it be lowered with a suspension adjustment without purchasing the low rider seat or would that mess up the ride telemetry ?
what else would you suggest for easy adjustment to customise the riding experience ?
i should mention that i 'm planning a long drive of 6000km round trip in a few months all going well .
any tips from the long distance riders out there ?

we all know that rossi is a good learner .
in 2013 he started anew with yamaha and in two years he learned enough to be fighting for the title in 2015 .
since the universal ecu and michelin tyres rossi has been struggling with the bike but do you think two seasons has been enough for rossi and his team to develop a good bike so that he can fight for the title in a serious way ?
in addition to that rossi has learned the new qualifying system so he can qualify in the first two rows for the majority of the races if he has a competitive bike .
i believe it all depends on how strong yamaha will be by the second half of the 2018 season .
considering ducati 's awakening and marc 's potentials and not writing off maverick 2018 will be a difficult season to win .
i 'm just tired of people rightfully complaining about the unfairness of being slut shamed and then in the same breath mocking/condeming someone else for being a virgin .
both of these things seem equally bad and silly to me .
it does n't sit right that one should be taken seriously while the other is n't .
i tend to like sweeter juices but i 'm hearing more against vg than sweeteners lately .

she looks sad lost her eyes dilate near the light reflection as she applies her red lipstick to feel more lively but no not even that .

so i lie there in the dim dreaming of a clandestine hope to be reborn again .

tl dr after two failed attempts at getting a referral im asking for help if you lot
ok so some info i 'm 17 and living in south wales ftm and just old enough to be referred to the adult services instead of child/adolescents .
i went to my old doctor when i had just turned 17 to get a referral .
he did n't know what a gic was and was adamant that he was not able to refer me .
no matter what i showed him he said it was not something he could do .
some stuff happens i change doctors for ease of access and because the old surgery was ignoring my complaints of pain which were bad enough for me to use a waking stick
i went to the new doctor at the start of the month to try again .
said he would have to look over my paper files before referring me .
i have n't heard anything back so i know thats dead in the water .
i do n't know what im supposed to say how much my doctor will know already how much i should expect them not to know .
i need a referral desperately but it seems impossible .
i 'm going to go private for hormones when i 'm 18 with gendergp because im skint but by no means plan to be private forever so that 's some light in the dark .

daenerys to theon and yara greyjoy season 6 ep 9
on behalf of house targaryen i ask for fogiveness for the crimes he committed against your family .
and i ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father .
is n't their survival more important than your pride ?
what kind of a queen am i if i 'm not willing to risk my life to fight them ?
i know what cersei has told you that i 've come to destroy your cities burn down your homes murder you and orphan your children .
i 'm not here to murder and all i want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over the rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the cersei lannisters of the world .
i offer you a choice bend the knee and join me together we will leave the world a better place than when we found it or refuse and die .
i 'm not here to put them in chains .
if that becomes an option many would take it .
i have fewer enemies today than i did yesterday .
you 're not sure how you feel about that ?
we both want to help people and we can only help them in a position of strength and sometimes strength is terrible .
you told me to do nothing before and i listened to you .
wish you had n't done it but i respect it .
if i had trusted you everything would be different .
i can only tell you what i have seen your grace .
i have seen you lean on their experience when your own is lacking and weigh the choices they put before you .
and i have seen you ignore your counselors because there is a better choice one that only you could see .
for what it 's worth i 've been a cynic for as long as i remember .
everyone is always asking me to believe in things family gods kings ... myself .
it was often tempting until i saw where belief got people .
so i said no thank you to belief and yet here i am .

a little background i 've been trying my hand at online dating .
i do get a decent amount of matches but what happens is that they just stop responding after a few texts .
i do n't think i was rude or boring i felt like i made my efforts .
she just stopped talking and it kinda sucks that i had to write so much and get a one line reply and she just bails .
i sound like a 10 year old but i need to fix this part of myself .
back in the day with the old shop system gold was incredibly valuable .
if you spotted a rare or epic card that you used in the shop you could easily gain 50 rares/10 epics .
nowadays i find myself stuck with a huge heap of gold that i do n't use on anything because i do n't want to waste it on cards i do n't use but i also have to wait 32089021932190 days to finally be able to upgrade my next rare card because it takes so damn long to get rare cards now .
and even if i get the cards i want in the shop i can only buy like 15 or so of them for like no gold at all .
so basically it is n't the amount of gold you have but the amount of luck you have .
if you could trade gold for gems it would fix this entire problem .
gems can be used to buy chests in the shop speed up chest cycles enter challenges etc .
gold is used for buying/upgrading cards and that 's pretty much it .

my 7 month old puppy wasnt socialized when he was a younger pup because of injury andailmenrs .

all of the singularity disappeared and the crisis of mankind has passed .
rayshift is frozen and chaldea 's contracted servants have all disappeared except davinci who is chaldea 's deputy director
fou wakes mc up and mc states that xmas has ended or just wishes fou a good morning can choose between either
you are already up and tells you davinci gave you all a holiday/some free time since you went through so much trouble clearing the singularities i think
i think then it 's about yesterday spending time with the servants/staff was the last chance and mashu tells you not to be sad about it and there is some part about leaving chaldea and mashu 's cleanical records and the summoning programm probably wether mashu is still fused with the servant but i 'm not sure sorry
there is some commotion outside and you go take a look
outside there is a chaldea control room staff member and an engineer and they are talking about some party and the new director that should arrive once the blizzard stops the two are called sylvia and duston thans u/belatkuro
the talk shifts to olga marie and that they are glad to get a new director instead of shutting chaldea down
the two notice you and tell you to go around chaldea and make as many memories as you can you wonder why they are not mages and you are explained that there are some non magician staff in chaldea the engineer for example was a physician who was researching cosmic rays ?
he goes on how he wanted to know about the rayshift and was very suspicious at first but it 's been 15 years already and he likes chaldea very much already
control room staff then tells you that he 'll go to london soon perhaps the clock tower ?
and that a new chaldeas model is about to be created
there will be a questioning for master candidates and mc will also be questioned there by the association ?
but as long there is davinci in chaldea there should n't be any problems and the two also tell you they are on your side in case something happens during the questioning
they tell you even if you ca n't give any more information you should tell them you are the master who saved 66 people representing chaldea
you go to davinci who wonders you are not with mashu since the year only has a few more days ?
they talk about the new director again and how the master candidate examination is to be held soon davinci offers to explain about it once more about chaldea and what happened
you get a summary about the abnormaly detected in 2015 how a team of masters a team was made and how everyone died except you and how you saved the world by defeating solomon and rebuild the foundation of humanity
chaldea lost 80 of its staff due to that and ca n't go on like it did so there is new staff sent from outside but there is a questioning team from the un coming as well because there was a change of staff probably romani ?
though the association can see the reason for that it 's just something on a paper for them ...
in short they are just assholes who do n't seem to care about what you had to go through and still consider everything that happened a crime
the meeting should be held to ascertain wether everything that happened was an accident or intentional davinci says from the perspective of the association the former caldea staff are all treated as criminals . ''
so davinci is trying to make a document to prove everything was a misunderstanding/an accident and there were no criminal acts in chaldea as everything was to save humanity
if mc can prove this davinci will be at mc 's service as well
and from the 47 masters who were involved in the rayshift accident to fuyuki only 7 are already unfrozen ?
aka they are a team now and they will be some of the new masters at chaldea seems like all were already unfrozen over the last year and left chaldea only 7 remain to make the a team as new masters of chaldea someone on discord said it 's like that ... do n't remember the username though x.x
davinci says she 'll take care that mc wo n't be labeled as unnecessary till the end of the year and she has prepared nearly 6 months for it
suddenly holmes pops up from somewhere seems he was hiding to surprise mc and davinci
he was n't reported to the association so he 's a secret ?
and will be an ally that 's not visible to the enemy
davinci has a trunk whose contents are as valuable as this earth . ''
and i can not bring it out yet because i have not transferred it yet but i will complete it in 5 days .
it is a calculation that will be in time before we leave caldea let 's tell you about the contents at that time . ''
and holmes says let 's clarify my hidden feats at that time if you become imprisoned ! ''

i am contemplating making my first revite 5 crest set but i do n't know how mino smash would worth with it .
right now here 's what i do if there is a gs which after the christmas sale will now be every base
mike is the first hero dropped since he can withstand the wayfliers for a few seconds and the revite 4 will still allow him to proc with the cupid buff .
however if he 's revite 5 i do n't think i can drop him before dropping mino since he 'd apply his buff to himself and nobody dropped after ...
how does this affect the mike/shield utility vs. wayfliers ?
... or is a revite 4 mike preferable in this case ?

i previously had a couple gfs and i definitely feel attracted to both sexes .
my bf had a gf in the past but did n't enjoy it that much but he likes them also .
i 'd love to invite some trustworthy girl so we can have a nice threesome but i do n't want him to think that i do n't like him or that i need to have woman to enjoy sex .
i feel great with him and i love him i just want to make sex a bit different and enjoy some piv both of us .

i 've recently upgraded to a core i7 8700k gigabyte aorus ultra gaming and 16gb of 3200 mhz g.kill ripjaw ram .
the operating system is windows 10 my gpu is a gt 970 that i 've had for years without issue as well .
just today after about 2 weeks of zero issues am i having constant bsod 's .
since i got home at around 6 pm on wednesday and still today it is just bsod'ing nonstop .
i had the chance to run bluescreenviewer and it was the same 3 culprits
i 've found that if i run in safe mode that it is completely stable and initially i uninstalled the only driver that was there nvidia gpu drivers after a reinstall and it was stable but since there was internet connectivity it auto updated auto installed gpu drivers and thus began the cycle again .
now i seem to not be able to even reinstall windows as when i hit install it bsod 's .
still i can boot into safe mode and happily sit there doing nothing
here is a link to the thread on tomshardware containing links to mem dumps and a history of what i 've tried and what others have suggested .
any help is appreciated im about to just put back in my 4th gen i5 setup as i still have it but would like to find out the root cause so if i have to rma i can do so .
in summary i 've tried to reseat the gpu as a hail mary test out the ram it happens on both sticks and i do not have any other ram to test but its pointing to a driver issue ?
remove all pcie cards just a sound card reinstall windows with no driver installation to follow seemed to be stable before windows auto installed gpu drivers

how good we were together jimmy says sitting next to abby https www.reddit.com/r/wormrp/comments/70igw2/abigail_steiner .
it 's lunch period and abby had fled outside like he usually does trying to find the table with zoe https www.reddit.com/r/wormrp/comments/6tqfhu/zombi .
her friend seems to have been avoiding her lately .
jimmy has her practically pinned a place a hand on her arm .
all abby 's ever been is the shy newcomer with the twin sister and autistic older brother .
she 'd been at kingston when they 'd killed belial .
but as he talks abigail steiner feels herself shrinking under his gaze collapsing under his pressure .
if she did he has friends here at the table with her practically boxing her into the little place where this table was .
they think they 're helping their good noble friend jimmy .
when they speak it 's to tell her to stop being such a huge bitch .
she hates herself as she lets jimmy walk all over her .
she does n't care how much he insists he loves her she 's not getting back with him !
but she 's ... this is hitting all the things that make her weak .
all the things that had turned abigail steiner into a parahuman .
she ca n't believe she let herself get cornered .

i have also not played video games in 8 years .
so i am in way over my head here .
from my understanding i need to get a laptop i want it to be portable with a more powerful graphics card .
which is fine because i have been saving up for a new laptop anyways .
with boxing day deals around the corner i have found two affordable options and hoping for some help from you guys on which one to pick .
both are made by dell i believe the specs are better on the cheaper one from best buy but i am not sure if the alienware brings something to the table i am missing other than brand name .
i do prefer a smaller laptop but if the best buy one is similar i will gladly save 300 .
edit advice on other options is also greatly appreciated .
however i am in canada so these prices are not usd .

let me preface this by saying i do hold bitcoin right now not any cash but looking to progress the crypto community as a whole so i 'm not opposed to owning either .
i am subbed to both r/btc and r/bitcoin so i get to see how both sides talk .
my biggest question is if the cash people think so highly of it why are they trying to ride the coattails of bitcoin ?
why did they fork instead of creating something new ?
to me they 're relying on what work bitcoin did instead of proving to the community they 're a better coin .
i understand the foundation of forking to be able to improve on the flaws and take it in a better direction and not rebuilding a brand new coin .
of course this is all just my stupid opinion and there 's much more to it than just that .
but if they truly want to succeed get off the original bitcoins nuts and beat them on your own .

my computer seems to work fine i had no problem until a couple weeks ago it started with a weird problem .
i share this computer with another person and each of us has a user with a password .
well the problem was that when i turned on the computer i logged in and when i wanted to turn it off it warned me that another person was using my computer and was signed in how could he if i turned on the computer ? .
so i decided to turn off the power input to the computer since then .
it got weird when i decided to try and turn it off with chrome and spotify both still running .
then i turned it on about 5 hours later and chrome youtube had still been watching videos one after each other and when i check my history it indeed had been watching videos related to the one i saw since i turned it off .
tl dr user seems to be active even when turning it off .
might be some ram problem malware i really have no idea or what do you think maybe it is the power supply unit ?

the passenger side lowbeam headlight goes out sometimes in my '01 acura tl .

you managed to make decently wide turns and nice slopes .
usually when someone posts a screenshot with the title something along the lines of yours i expect wonky and way to steep slopes super tight turns or none at all and completely unnecessary connections that are also far too long and just add complexity .

just from the opening scene it 's one of my favourite movies .
he started off as an abusive husband and father so i think it is unsurprising that he remained violent as the story continued .
it was not a tragedy that he tried to kill his family it was quite predictable .
it became the story of a mean man who was mean because he just was .

got the volume one kotkin 's stalin bio for christmas 😍
keep on buying until you feel the sensation of accomplishment burst in your chest or your credit limit maxes out whichever comes first .
i have found that the spinners are a big culprit .
to test this grab a spinner and look at a wall .
place said spinner then observe fps suddenly drop 30-40 fps just by placing it not even spinning it .
that 's what i have found to be a big leak also the lantern/wall lamps also destroy the fps simply by looking at it .
on the server i play on we had a guy go around and build just outside of peoples tc range like 2 walls and covers them with spinners .
it wrecks the fps of that person in the base and makes fighting back a hard time .

it 's when you first set up the computer with a microsoft account in windows 10 it does n't enable admin .
i have to enable it all the time at work .

aye but this was 10 years ago and when it comes down to last minute shopping for your dad then what better present than a free stereo unit ?
all of my previous cars have had none detachable fronts ...
including my current 206 ... first thing i did was get a sony detachable front put in .
bluetooth from the phone or not you need something for that to connect to and replacing the entire unit along with what they snapped out is not cheap .
but a £300 unit is more than half the price of my car at the time .
it was also enough to get a forensics team out at the time but they could n't get shit unfortunately .
killing their master sith lord while hes just sitting there distracted is not an example of a scene playing out great .
not only does it make me think snoke was weak kylo seems weak by default .
but for the record i hated both tfa and tlj for very different reasons .
with your situation you have to go with foles .
ben is highly unlikely to have a big day without using juju as he 'll be the 1 wr .
if ben does bad then juju will as well limits his ceiling at least .
start foles and separate yourself from the steelers game script .
as a person who has many cousins and close friends who are not biologically related to me family is n't just about the blood you share .
great to hear that you are both happy op !
i 'm getting the feeling i 'm not the only one who tried but ended up hitting a wall and plummeting into water and leaving the match .
you can change the settings and bowl around to use it different ways .
i 've been using it like a firewood 4 having a more session style but it 's also really good at extracting really fast so i have also been cranking it up a little/riding the bost and clearing whatever i loaded into it in 1-4 drags .
i ordered antiminer d3 in october and received it recently .
it 's working but dash mining difficulty got increased and roi looks sad now .
sounds like a good idea but it means you 'll have to play elliot for whu 's bgw and he might not play .
we got christmas eve and day and bm was trying to make so feel guilty about him picking her up yesterday .
if she was extremely ill then no we would have just let her stay there but it 's a cold ...
if you are in this position then at least transfer to gdax and transfer to your own addresses for no charge .
marq looked at the empty chair where the master of coin was supposed to sit alas he happened to be unclaimed absent .
considering how unsuccessful marq had been the last time https www.reddit.com/r/sevenkingdoms/comments/7jmff1/event_capital_punishment/dr7ijf3 he wanted to speak with lord penrose it was evident that his plans were foiled .
he did n't try to hide his disappointment bowed stiffly and excused himself with a formal
edit just noticed you u/-kestrels are the new penrose .
do you want to react to the above assuming ronnel is present in the throne room ?
there will always be a steady supply of twelve year old girls for these kinds of people to keep making money from .
feminism is only possible in a civilized society and a civilized society is only possible when men behave in a civilized way .
so you 're welcome feminists everything you have comes from men .

i thought santa was on the cover before i saw that it was a box .
tell that to all the rape victims out there who get ignored .
or the children beaten by their parents without consequence for years .
how about that farmer in texas who murdered the man who he caught in the act raping his 6 year old daughter in the barn that even the state decided was perfectly logical and acceptable ?
you do n't have to be pro-vigilante in every scenario but to not understand that everything has a time and a place is a form of arrogance ignorance and naivete .
but you keep your moral superiority and go on living in your binary ass world .
all the cars i 've owned have never locked the steering wheel before taking the key out .
you have to turn the key 1 notch to get it off but it will not lock up before the key slides out .
so you can turn it to off and then on without it locking up .
and btw if we 're still talking about the bus in the vid they have brakes that are always on '' .
there 's air brakes on busses and trucks which constantly is being pushed up against the drum/disc by springs .
there 's an air compressor and an air tank which holds compressed air .
the air is used to push the brake pads off the drum/disc when the vehicle is on .
so if there 's anything wrong with the brakes it will lock the wheels up .
maybe if you work a deadend job and have no hobbies or relationships lol
probably because it was a cruiser and building missles the size of star destroyers isnt really in the rebel budget .
the first order seems like they can afford it but it looks like building a blaster the size of a star destroyer is preferrable unsurprisingly .

me well at least he is in the nfc west
also me oh yeah we play the nfc west next year .
are you unaware of what took place in october of last year ?
because if one is to follow the narrative pushed since then assange has n't had control of his account for 14 months and wikileaks have been compromised .
and for it to then restart now ignoring the whole spectacle of last year while drawing the same conclusions is just retarded .
how can you be so certain it 's deep state '' this time ?
as last time it was the israeli private intelligence company black cube an extension of mossad for hire .
both was posted last year as proof of life yet discarded by most as fake .
even his appearance on the balcony is explained as fake .

i 'd believe in it anyway but several trillion dollars on a country 50 of americans could n't find on a map when it could have paid for all our healthcare that 's a no brainier bush 's wars made me a strong believer in nationalized healthcare .

seriously though fans who have fallen off with a team that has a very realistic chance at a playoff berth have no resolve .
things are n't all roses at the moment but there are much darker timelines .
yeah but not when you stuff your face to the fullest extent because you lack self control
i highly recommend butcher for your 2d blood soaked platformer needs .

bailey is the only one who put points on the board for dallas today .
not his fault the rest of the team did n't show up .

i wish everyone would stand up to it but not everyone is that brave .
any scientist worth their salt in their respective field knows before pen hits paper that what they 're about to write will be revised at some point in the future .
try as we might our ignorance is much more vast than our knowledge and science is simply the method by which our knowledge encroaches upon our ignorance .
as with any topic of study physics can be approached from two directions top-down and bottom-up .
and just like any other topic of study these two methods do n't line up as nicely as you might hope when they meet up in the middle .
normally one would hope that the messy area in the middle would yield a lot of information to make sense of the problem but ... we 're still working on it .
i 'd say i 'm on the jesus christ mark that 's annoying as fuck '' level in etymology

asking a girl to put on more cloths on the interwebs only on twitch .
if that were the cause the randomization would eventually have everyone winning the same amount .
rng means random some may win more and others may win less .
if one team is worse than another team the better team will win even if the circle favored the bad team .
but in a round where both teams are similarly skilled and the circle favors one over the other then the randomization there is the fault .
should you have positioned better in the previous circle to account for possible future circles ?
how is it even possible for a person to predict the future circle ?
the circle can spawn dead center the top right top left bottom right bottom left or places in between all of those .
i 've played many games where me and my team played the edge instead of going dead center and camping and we won because the circle kept getting smaller on us .
and we also had games where we went dead center and camped and kept moving to the newer circle to the center and we still got screwed over by the last circle .
the game victor is heavily determined by rng there 's no way arguing against that .
there 's a reason this game will never be a serious e-sport .
going into this game i was actually worried we might win top 3 pick ! !
you 're going to stay here and you 're going to like it ! ... pls
from what i remember of my days working with laser diodes i know that i 'd injure myself with this .
i have mine set to middle mouse click which is ok can can make it difficult to cancel cast m1s compared to other abilities .
put it in a comfortable spot you definitely want to use it often .
it can get really icy with chunks falling down on it as things warm later in the day wear a helmet .
i dunno if they require the permits in winter we 've hiked half dome with the cables down but that was decades ago .
it can be quite a mess if there 's snow on them or if they 're frozen down onto the rock .
but there 's been way too little snow this year so who knows ?
still worth a visit there even if half dome is a scratch .
but i 've gotten some compliments and creepy messages from r/ratemeteen so idk

i think the nail in the coffin for the 1917 is the rate of fire and its damage .
if the rate of fire was something like 450 it would be much better .
i 'm buying a 1440p monitor and it will also have freesync or g sync depending on what i get .
so definitely need something to power that at at least 60fps .
to be honest i was actually thinking of expanding it even more .
sort of how nomadlist https nomadlist.com has categories for places to work remotely communities etc. this could have top companies to work for info about locations a lot of posts on this subreddit ask about the best places to live online/offline communities and other things as it grew .
edit and to your original point career paths industries majors etc .
there 's actually a book called the iron dream '' in which hitler emigrates to the us and becomes a trashy pulp sci-fi novelist .
lol i 'm sorry your mom is like that .
i thought it over and felt like i had a lot more fun reading himiko than i did for gundham .
i think from chapter 2 to 5 she 's seriously consistently surprising and fun .
do they have to be stationed in a city or can you just spam recon units until you have a 500 or something stupid faith generation bonus ?
it acts as your proof of owning the game .
most of the game including all the main campaign missions can be played entirely solo if you want to although if you want to play with others you can group with friends or there is optional matchmaking for most things but some end-game stuff does require grouping up and other things are just easier with a group although technically soloable .
i have n't played it in a while really should go back and check out the 1.8 update at some point but back when it released i put in 200h or so mostly solo with occasional matchmade groups .
there 's a free trial available which will give you 6h to check it out which should be enough to get a decent handle on how it plays .
first they were losing close games now they 're winning close games .
pg has been a lot more active the last two games as well .
i knew as soon as him and ingles got into it at the beginning of the last game that he was going to go off .
if they can get pg going early and make him be aggressive they become about ten times harder to beat .
none of the people whining have the self control to make anything happen
how soon after the surgery did you resume treatment ?

im argentine and i speak spanish my phone keeps the auto corrector on even though i disabled it .
well more than 50 of the usa definitely is retarded .
no it 's 2-4 players and an expansion pack can be bought for 5-6 players .
there are also a bunch of other expansions that add more content to the game .
this is the single best piece of chinesism this company makes if ya ask me ... used one for many pistols and still works like the day i got it and it 's pretty damn well built which is more than you can say about every other piece of garbage this company produces .
and watch out if you question why a particular coin even has value because it literally does nothing .
a lynch mob will form in minutes instead of having a civil discussion .
that 's why i think a lot of investors '' in the crypto space are n't really mature and mostly buy/sell on emotion only .
i swear i put in camel armour but whatever .
it works for ballistia elephants because they are their own dedicated unit .
it does n't work for imperial camels because they are a continuation of a current unit .
so we have an upgrade to a unit that makes them have higher hp 2 attack trains 2 seconds faster for whatever reason but make them worse against all anti-cavalry camel attacks to the point where they are worse at dealing with halbs other camels and even buildings then their heavy camel counterparts ?
i do n't know but making any heavy camels be able to straight up counter imperial camels 1v1 just seems like a bad idea no offense .
upgrades to units should never be like this where there are obvious and significant downsides to upgrades and makes the person think if they should get it or not outside of the typical situation .
this is darkest dungeon stalker tiered balancing or like those weird aoe3 church techs that nobody really liked .
i agree that they went a bit overboard with the camels but in this case with imperial camels again there are better ways to nerf them such as making their upgrade more expensive or giving them less hp .
or the fact that they train in 20 seconds as opposed to regular heavy camels 22 seconds .
i brush my teeth and i 'm still losing them
so if i 'm understanding correctly strength nodes will get 4-5 of all fees generated on the network divided amongst them equally ?
i think it 's because authenticity is the new it '' and chance has some of that .
in dave grossman 's book on killing '' great book highly recommend he details the post-wwii research conducted into making people kill .
during wwii only about 10 of soldiers aimed to kill .
the majority of soldiers aimed high pretended to fire or made themselves busy in other ways .
in fact many soldiers will not kill even at the cost of their own lives .
that factoid has been called into serious question if not outright debunked .
true but he made it sound like the channel managers big hunch on marvin but other potentials are care and/or michael and rainer 's parents who himself might be rainer ?
and paul 's mom filled him in on a lot .
earth-chan being disappointed is even worse than her i 'll always love you '' attitude .

you do n't build around anything you just try to fit cards into a curve matching universal deck archetypes aggro midrange control .
its intended deck archetypes are attached to awkward amulets in support cannon and castle in the sky .
every other class has at least one viable deck where you can build around an interesting win condition .
i do n't think ucb gives financial aid to internationals .
as for stanford your chances of getting in are abysmal just like everyone else .
0.14 seconds just sounds so much faster when you take into account how legacy systems work .
the surplus energy kept at all times in case of a power plant tripping is stored as the kinetic energy of turbines .
that means mechanical systems are involved and now we 're talking response times orders of magnitude slower than a chemical system that is a lithium battery .
how in the world does one get hit on in a not sincere way ?

there 's 3 reasons to keep your base at a high pressure .
1 when your base 's air pressure is greater in your base than out of it any leaks will cause you to lose gas instead of letting problematic gases in .
having a high internal pressure helps keep your base clean of contaminants .
2 high pressure helps keep the contaminants that do enter your base out of the way .
if you have have a 300g pressure in your base 10 kg of chlorine will take up a whopping 33.33 tiles of space in your base .
if your base is at 2kg that same chlorine will only take 5 tiles of space in your base .
if your air pressure is low contaminant gasses that would normally be compressed into a tiny area will begin to take over your base .
3 there 's simply no reason not to keep your base at a high pressure .
10kg of oxygen will supply you with 2.5 dup/minutes of oxygen regardless of whether it 's tied up in algae or in the air .
100kg of algae will sustain your dups for the same amount of time whether you release it all now or wait until later .
only if you release it now your base will have fewer problems with vacuums and other invading gas .
also if you 're out of power or ca n't produce more oxygen you have a larger buffer before problems begin to occur if you keep pressure high .
wear a bandaid or a watch to cover it .
it 's just to see that you can physically handle the day to day things you will do .
i had to do a wall sit lift and carry a 30 pound bag properly sit ups and push ups but nothing crazy .
legally they ca n't ask you what the scar is from .
i know a lot of flight attendants that have tattoos on their wrist most of them just wear large band watches .
jp says about the great works of literature if you read a book and you did n't get anything from it the problem is n't the book the problem is you .
there is no known proven cause for pcos in fact it has only been in more recent years after some research that it was discovered after my diagnosis there are actually 4 types of pcos https www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3872139 .
women who have never been fat a day in their lives still get it their pituitary was n't damaged by poor eating habits or insulin resistance .
this is why the assumption that i or anyone else with pcos would be using a disease an excuse or scapegoat needs to stop .
you do n't have to agree but as the one with the illness and it 's struggles including the cancer that robbed me of my fertility at 37 preceded by 3 miscarriages i am asking you and anyone who shares your view to realize that as much as most people love to think so not every issue a fat person has is because they decided to be fat or were too lazy to care or lacked discipline or that anything wrong with them is rooted in their being fat first .
your expressed opinion suggests to me you know very little about how the human body actually works and i wish the aspect of an open mind would come ahead of assumptions and knows-best attitudes .
hormones are n't produced by body fat for one thing but they are stored there especially estrogens and it is just as likely the pituitary irregularities or improper function happened first which caused excess growth hormone in addition to cortisol and others well before puberty causing my weight gain increasing my appetite and without that nutrition as a kid left me in a vicious cycle that was worsened by the onset of puberty .
it would be vital for anyone to learn how hormones are produced and how they affect the body http www.yourhormones.info/glands/pituitary-gland
tl dr there are many ways a fat person may be fat with an associated illness that was n't simply their choosing aka do n't be so quick to blame the fat person and their fat as the culprit every time .
learn more about the body and approach it from a research perspective rather than simply opinion links .
everyone should be free to do as they please .
seeing dale earnhardt in that corvette brings up a what if once dale retired would be go full time sport car racing he was a perfect fit at corvette racing and the team enjoyed having him around .
giving my account i dont want to spent more time in this grindfest/fukchips game .
i was around 5 or 6 when i got this notebook that i started jotting stuff down in .
i got into reading fairly early lol not maths .
you could hardly call it writing but i wrote in that notebook for a long time .
and the ideology 's name is ... . marxism .
at least your 4.0 does n't have the timing chain issue
while they do n't have the greatest storylines something the ys series never really had it does have great gameplay and a fantastic soundtrack .
they 're not in zero g if they 're not in orbit .
if they 're using engines to maintain their position above the planet instead of taking an orbital trajectory gravity will absolutely still pull the bombs down .
it 's not that the unique is low level it 's that it is in a very common tier .
lycosidae is low level as well and yet it 's rare as fuck now .
but we must not forget that everything looked so bad back then because of how lethal real madrid was .
we got worse than the previous seasons over time far from our best .
never forget we also got a lot of disadvantages from referees decisions over the last half a decade at least still do .
they did n't even give us 10 exotics 5000 legendary shards or make me breakfast .
i stated my opinion in response to their opinion .
a few sellers annoyed me by not leaving feedback after i left it for them .
it 's curious that the author admin did not provide a link to the review '' that is the focus of this piece.
removing mid game switching would change the essence of the game .
what i proposed is nothing huge as that it 's just to allow both teams to ban 2 characters out of 26 .
it sound so horrible to play 24 out of 26 characters to make the game less of the same ?
i did not try to disprove your argument by saying you should have done the work .
i was pointing out that you are not following the protocol of how to cite sources .
my conclusion even was that there was a spike though i said it was n't because of the holiday but because of the new content/events which always increase player counts .
i had no idea of your edit because you made it after i saw your post .
but if you claim something and someone asks you for proof then you provide it and not just give general directions to it .
you 'll get thrown out of your course in a heartbeat .
maybe it was the department of the interior and not utahans that thought of this .
they only act that way because they are projecting their own insecurities onto you .
if they were smart they would see the error in their line of thinking .
they also would n't be bullying a child of their family .
you are loved by us we really care about you and we want you to be safe and happy you will grow up and bring beautiful contributions to this world .

if you want to have a little fun next time they lay into you record their meanness and when they ask you why you never want to see them again let 's say next christmas just send that to them .
could n't tell by the use of that awful 2009 meme .
i would recommend keeping the second athena just imo .

every language becomes easier to use once you know how to use it .

private banks still need to comply with a country 's laws if the bank wishes to operate in said country .
hence they hire compliance officers to ensure that they are operating legally .
compliance officers are employees of the bank so they are free to fire them at will or kick them out '' as you say .
but they wo n't fire them because they want to be in compliance with the law .
my guess is that you equate officer '' with a government official .
private companies have all kinds officers '' starting with the ceo none of which work for the government .

op mentioned 1 area of the car the roof that needs reinforcing .
another area they 'd need to fix is the front end and crumple zones .
cars are designed to crumple so the humans inside take less of the shock .

dieng patton kat and gibson mean we are already overloaded specifically at pf and that 's whilst considering bjelica as a wing .
taking on a decent big would mean patton is either getting relegated to the g league or riding the bench .
teague is a good point guard but a ball dominant one .
he would be bad if pushed to the 2 and it would be a waste of his skill to put him on the bench especially considering how little minutes our back ups get .
imo optimal would be a starter quality 3 and d wing who has more off ball presence than wiggins has .
we do n't need another guy who needs the ball in his hands to be useful .
a shooting guard in particular would be good someone who could match up good point guards to hide teague 's unimpressive defence .
a player like avery bradley gary harris khris middleton or pat beverly would be ideal .
any of these players plus a bench scorer and/or picks would be the right direction i would think .

the thing big-e said at the end was ok though and reminds us of the big-e we all know ... or used to know at least

luckily dh completely understands anxiety so when i told him in this how ridiculous am i ? tone he laughed with me .

hello fellow galaxy users a week ago my 5t arrived and i am loving it so far .
i am getting 1 day of standby and 5 hours of sot .
before i was thinking to get the pixel xl 2 but the blue tint issue i saw it irl made me say no .
i also considered the pixel 2 but i hate the big bezels .
i went with 5t because i wanted something stock with little bit of customization .
i also like the s8 design but i was fed up with samsung software .
also the pixel 2 display is better than the 5t .
i wanted more raw performance than a good camera shooter .
hardware buttons i can barely feel the buttons on the 5t .
overall i would still used by s6 if it wasnt for the battery life .
i used to get 6 hours of standby and 3 hours of sot .

i hear all those stories about how some asians feel excluded or different because of their different culture and how it 's unlike american culture to be fair though what culture does america have but personally i never felt like that .
what i do feel though is that i feel like i 'll never be pretty or decent looking because of my skin color .
i 'm vietnamese and i have tanner skin rather than the pale white asian skin .
i already do n't fit typical asian beauty standards but not only that i feel like i 'll never be pretty because i am not white have european facial features .
i constantly hear that you are beautiful despite your skin color but i do n't feel that way .
however when it comes to me i feel like i 'm not pretty because of my skin color .
it 's kind of a double standard in the sense that why can other people of color be attractive in my eyes but not myself .
sometimes i just wish i was n't asian because i do n't feel beautiful because of my skin color .
and i know my race is something i ca n't change but my mother has this paler skin so i wish i had gotten her skin tone rather than more of my fathers .

okay so i 'm 16 and i 've been playing with my ass since i was maybe 10 .
i lost my virginity at maybe 14 and i 've had sex maybe 4 times since .
the problem is that whenever i play with myself anal feels absolutely incredible .
but every time i actually do anything with a guy it just feels like someone is punching my insides .
it does n't even compare to when i play with myself .
none of them were especially big either maybe average at most .
so i 've been dating this girl who i met at work and it 's been over close to over a year now .
at first our relationship started out great and we stopped march of last year .
i found out she was seeing someone else outside and then she was seeing someone at work .
she 's left the job and moved to a different job .
she stopped both relationships when i found out about it and we committed to being with each other .
everything again started out great and we 've talked about getting married and settling down and having kids .
but i feel like i 've become over bearing and possessive when it comes to her knowing what i know now .
it 's become a situation where i 'm constant asking her what she 's doing and i 'm constantly checking up on her snapchat and linkedin accounts .
i do n't have her password or anything but i 'm always wondering if she 's going to cheat on me .
we understand each other so well and we finish each other and we just have a good time when we are together .
but i feel like my over bearing nature will kill the relationship .
i need advice on what i can do to stop myself from being like this .
any books or suggestions or some sort of direction would be appreciated .
i remember reading this book but i forget the name of it .
all i remember is that during the climax of the book it takes place during a play where the girlfriend punches her boyfriend with an icepack in the stomach .
he does n't feel it because she drugged him and he thinks he 's alright but he starts bleeding .
the girl also fake writes journal entries about him because she 's crazy .
i know there 's plenty from promotional material but i think we all have our own ear worms .
for me it 's been ozruk yelling break yourselves upon my boh-deeeee !

memes and so called other low effort '' posts are actually very effective sentiment analysis and deliver nuanced messages in a lightweight format that does n't feel as dense as fully written out articles/blog posts .
with the pace of crypto markets where 1 hour can be the price difference of 10-100 memes are some best of the ways to stay up to date especially when you want to find out general consensus about a recent event .
i realize how stupid this sounds but sentiment analysis is just one more form of smart analysis and closing any channel of analysis is even stupider .
that being said i can understand that this sub is home to all types of discussion so i want to know if there 's a subreddit we can go to check out price discussion and other so-called low effort '' posts .

note i cant change the post title but ive since changed the name of this collection to the bam margera film series ultimate collection '' to avoid confusion from the fact that cky1-4 are omitted here.. the cky video series collection is a large task to take on and one that deserves an amount of lpve attention that i ca n't promise it at this time .
i only intended to focus on bam 's scripted films here .
this rather ambitious project came about when creating a higher-quality version of the haggard making of documentary for my buddy campfillyourshelf 's youtube channel https www.youtube.com/user/campkillyourshelf prompting me to make a new file with hard fixes to all the shots displaying incorrect aspect ratios .
i mirrored this technique for the conversions of the remaining bonus material soon deciding to release a collection similar to my ultimate viva la bam collection https www.reddit.com/r/cky/comments/5wrte4/viva_la_bam_the_ultimate_collection earlier this year .
on top of the edits the negation of commentary tracks in scene releases always gave me a desire to release minghags to the subreddit with said feature intact .
unfortunately i must reiterate that these are simply high resolution 720p edits '' sourced from the dvd using the deinterlace and resize filters that fit each shot best rendering the best output file possible respective to the original film media .
the topic of a true hd film transfer and remaster has been discussed numerous times by cinematographer joseppe frantz who insists that while his passion for the project remains as strong today as it did during filming the project is simply too expensive for the time being .
speaking recently in regard to the transfer of the original cky video series joe is quoted as saying
you know i would love to actually go through and do shot per shot all high definition where we shot the original motion picture film put in the high definition shots go back find the because when we were doing those they were edited on a media 100 .
and those were all imported at half-quality exported and then imported again at half-quality .
so basically they 're all about an eighth the quality .
and now with all the color corrections you can do ... its a whole new world . ''
while this relates more to cky1-4 than traditional films haggard minghags it shows the kind of technology they utilized in the early 2000s on their own budget and equipment .
considering haggard a film any fan knows intimately and for luckily holding dvd copies i intend on breathing fresh life into these projects for two film endeavors that helped shape the lives of most here on the alliance subreddit it 's a new look at material we all know like the back of our stunted yet significantly bulky genitalia .
eventually one potentially skeptical user put it simply its prolly the best rip of it out there . ''
so while i see this collection as a must have for all cky fans out there i leave it to the user to decide .
please just send me a whisper to request a link and i 'll respond as soon as i can .
the comments section was never meant to be the place to make this request hopefully this note will help clear that up .

within the last month i picked up a used 07 ' civic sedan only 90,000 km car has been great but these last two days my front speakers have been cutting out completely and then coming back in .
there is no crackling/fuzzy sound in the front speakers they sound fine when they come back on and it appears when the car vibrates turning in snow speed bumps it triggers the sound loss .
i 'm not a car guy but i 'm assuming something is loose somewhere .
i read there are two amplifiers one for the front speakers and one for the rear and logically i could see the problem being there as it is both front speakers and tweeters cutting out simultaneously .
i think the amplifier is under the front seat not entirely sure how to access it .
side note was debating getting aftermarket stereo and sub amp at some point would it make more sense to just purchase and have these installed and sidestep narrowing down this problem
yeah this is gon na be spammy just remember that a squared equals b squared plus c squared kiddos !

havent seen this listed yet but if the trap explodes on a row without any enemies it is not banished .
you 're essentially giving the opponent 1 point lol ...
i was playing the elven scout and trapper was the best option so i placed it on an empty row i dont know if it behaves different when you place it on an occupied row and enemies are moved after .
i 've been looking to get into ripple xpr considered its bridging value between traditional and new institutions .

i am in the middle of a house-declutter not sure that christmas-time is the perfect moment for that but anyway and i just tumbled upon various projects that i was very happy to make at the time but that i rather not put somewhere in my house .
who might be interested by them and to whom i could have gifted the objects
the projects are finished but not ironed nor framed and i am not sure to have the courage to do it ...
i find them quite nice one is a dragon the other one a japanese woman with lots of nice flower patterns but it 's not really my style of house-decoration ...
two obvious solutions appear to me either keep them and do nothing with it or toss it ?
do you see other options for these finished but not loved '' projects ?
for my very first side project i want to build a personal website describing who i am and have my portfolio on it .
but the problem is i do n't have any other side projects to put on my website since the website is my first project .
my question is should i make my website my first side project or should i work on something else first and then make a website later when i have a couple of projects to list .
recently a law passed in norway that give trans people the option to change their official gender which means a new id number will be issued and their preferred gender will be listed in official document stuff .
before the law was you had to be castrated first .
so now my gf and i got our papers and while we were already women it 's just feels so damn good to see that now the government agrees too and to have it written down on official documents .
now we just have to get new passports and library cards and stuff !
i found he 's quite fun against physical melee right clickers with around those items pipe was taken to counter pugna who has very strong early magic and to buff team also to stop team being demoralized .
also the team balance is really felt here and felt not one side has too many noobs .
weakness non-physical attacks cc that are not physical probably ca n't do anything very ranged right-clickers with satanic and mana burn so probably unfun when there 's naix .
i was hoping there would be an enemy doom to test his passive out but oh well .
not sure what to say but i know i can make a difference if i would pick a higher tier hero but as promised i 'll play a few tide games .
everyone participated in fights moderately it 's just the way it is .
nothing special i tank quite ok. tho you have no ability to fountain farm only have fun against am who kills himself with his ult .
other than that other cases they just stop attacking with bm
update now the system is back throwing all low levels on my side again and also the crashes .
so i have to stop for the meantime ca n't give a balanced review at this rate .

my mibox has been having this sound issue since last weekend .
everytime i watch video in youtube netflix kodi it will have this on and off sound .
it 's like when you 're listening to dolby message instead of 'all around you.. ' you listen to 'all ... ... .you '
i tried restarting unplugging hdmi cable and plugging it again check for software update resetting the electricity .
it 's a slow day i 'm in and out of my office and lacking release .
send me cute sexy intense beautiful pictures or gifs .
ones that stand out from the sea that 's out there .
i 'll get back to you as soon as i can .
i 'm not looking for dick or pussy pics close ups do n't do anything for me .
i ca n't watch videos right now so stay clear of those .
real people are far more attractive than porn actors .
let me first say that this is n't thing about her sex or age or even hair colour .
want i want is more a fun up-bit series that has been lacking for the last 2 seasons .
the 12th doctor did n't have that fun spark that i miss from the 10th and 11th ... the goofy fun times that were had .

every second person these days seems to get brought back to life in one form or another .
i was raised in a religious household church every sunday for 18 years .
and i feel like my depression stems from my confusion of reality .
in college i took some mushrooms and they really made me realize that i just listened to and followed the directions of my peers and parents never did anything for myself .
i found myself in an education program that would do nothing for me but make money .
i mean that 's good enough for most people but being raised religiously i just believed that my life was supposed to have more meaning than that .
what happened to all that i learned in sunday school ?
i 'm supposed to be more like him right ?
going to church for one hour a week makes being a part of a bloodsucking society okay ?
the mushrooms presented many questions and when coupled with an introductory philosophy course it shattered my worldview .
when i feel like i want to join the ranks and forget about my feelings i wish i had never taken them .
but i know they revealed a truth to me it 's stirred up a certain insubordination within myself and it 's kind of to the point where i ca n't hold down a job .
like i ca n't just give in to the society that made things so shit and will continue to do so for god knows how long .
when you decide to turn against the church things can get destructive within yourself .
being taught from birth that god 's will is the greatest force in the universe and attempting to remove that idea from your head has proven to me to be nigh impossible .
i do n't really even believe it anymore but there still exists this almost schizophrenic idea that this life is a test a lie and that i should be living my truest life .
which is what i 'm doing as a depressed guy by avoiding the blind dogma of religion .
the whole faith is worthless if there is evidence '' fucks with me hard too .
i do n't know anymore i still think about it daily but i have n't progressed in years .
tl dr being raised religiously went totally against the way my brain naturally processes things through logic and now i 'm just confused to the point of futility .
just want to see if many people are in similar boats because i have met very few in real life .
any suggestion for apps that track internet history on android phone ?

we are a lesbian couple so we are not sure if it 'll work the same for us ... we are thinking of australia and canada at the moment mainly because of their higher degree of acceptance towards immigrants and lgbt-friendliness .

it 's christmas for chrissakes ok bad pun so what game or moment did you appreciate from the lions most this season ?
for me the best game was the first vikings game we thought this team just beat regardless of the score the super bowl losers and was on top of the nfc when they came away with a w after playing what was arguably the best defense in the nfl .
my favorite moment was jamal agnew 's punt return against new orleans following ashawn robinson 's td .
this was back when we thought this team was destined for something division title ?
and thought at the time that this team might beat a playoff-bound saints team in the superdome .
no matter what happens these next few weeks i try to remember that these coaches are real people with real families .
so i 'm pretty sure i messed up 125 this semester and i 'm wondering how to retake it and how the grades will be affected .
also is it possible to go ahead to 126 173 before retaking 125 ?
i 'm aware that currently we can reset out trees and repick classes .
i had w3 l1 el3 but now i heard that linker is kinda bad so i wanted to swap it out .
but otherwise what other classes to you build for el3 nowadays isntead of w3 ?
when the door creaked open two-year-old cerenna slid from her nursemaid 's grasp like a slippery eel toddling rapidly over to her father 's legs .
mama ! she cried fully expecting her mother to be the one to enter the room .
but it was an older man with graying hair who entered instead .
cerenna frowned bottom lip jutting out in the moue of a pout as she curled her fist in dairren 's breeches tugging until he looked down at her .
mama where ? she asked greenish-hazel eyes gazing up at him .
for feona 's final month of pregnancy she had been prescribed bed rest hardly allowed to walk for the dizziness and fatigue that overtook her when she stood for any length of time .
young as she was cerenna did n't understand why her mother had been absent as of late only that her father and nursemaids and aunt cerissa swept her up when she tried to climb and bounce on her mother 's bed much to her chagrin .
and now today her mother had been absent entirely .
the maester spared no glance toward the little girl closing the door quietly behind him before looking straight at dairren .
there was no expression on the normally genial man 's face which was perhaps more indicative than anything else as he stroked his long beard still stinging from when feona had yanked it and shouted at him in the throes of labor .
his hands were clean which suggested he had time to clean up .
my lord he started opting to go for the good news first .
he allowed that to sink in a moment before continuing however the labor was difficult .
lady feona has been taken with a childbed fever that refuses to break despite our best efforts. he placed his hands in the long sleeves of his robes .
we are doing all that we can though i suggest you prepare yourself maester lomas told the lannister gently .
her survival is in her own hands and those of the gods now .
you may visit her and your new daughter should you wish.
but sure that will make him less money so he cant ditch for days/weeks after one stream .
so for now i 'll be putting all our ideas for playable maps in this post so we can go into further detail later .
as always feel free to tell us about any new ideas you might have .

so my friend wanted to start dming and bought a dnd starter set online and i wanted to make his first game it was his first time playing dnd too memorable .
i ended up deciding that to make things interesting for him i played a rogue tortle i took the thieves pack named him titian after the renaissance artist .
any time he spoke it was with that 90 's surfer accent .
we were all goofin and gaughin the whole time .
it 's really fun roleplaying him but difficult to play .
i 'm gon na miss titian but i 'll be glad he 's gone .
i find overwatch way too boring most of the time i kind of regret buying it .

my sophomore year of college i had wheelchair bound fellow in one of my classes .

amazon and ebay are n't good sources for parts .
try going directly to the manufacturer web site and then use things like digikey mouser allied fanell avnet sparkfun etc .
ti has lots of ldo 's with soft start and their website will point you to distributors .
if you still have trouble let me know ... i 'm at a red light right now and ca n't really look for anything .
these options are for corporations to hedge downside risk for incoming receiveables and payables .
if you want to speculate normal leveraged positions are less complex .
when you say it does n't work do you mean it shows up in-game but does n't load ?
if the radio does n't show up at all but works through your browser you might 've added the stream incorrectly in live_streams.sii '' .
make sure you 've added something similar to this stream_data number here http kdub.out.airtime.pro:8000/kdub_b|kdub hit country|country|us|128|1 '' say you wish to have this station 1st in game you 'd want it as stream_data 0 '' and you 'd want to put it in the top of the file which should be on line 5 .
the next thing to check is if you 've changed stream_data some number '' just above on line 4 to include your newly added stream here you should add the highest numbered station 's number and add 1 to it say you have stations from 0 to 199 we 'll need to put in 200 on line 4 the reason for this is because 0 is counted as 1 this could also be the solution if you 've added the stream as the last in the file .
now i do n't seem to have any issues accessing the stream both in my browser and through ets2 so it 's not region-locked for europe at least .
and since the stream is in mpeg it 's understood by ets2 and ats so we should n't need to change the url either .
however if you ca n't access it outside the game either i 'm not sure what to do sadly .
if it does show up in game and works in your browser do make sure to check the volume of the game in your sound settings and in the radio settings in game too i 've missed this a few times too .
i masturbate while in the same car with my husband 's parents parking lot blowjob etc .

i do n't understand why people refuse to believe he 's an old racist .
there used to be a group of 5-6 of them that always flew around my city .
you 'd know they were coming long before they got there with their awesome sounding engines .
have n't seen them in probably over a decade now .
i think they moved east of here and a lot of their pilots owners were getting up in age .
most modern kevlar vest options allow you to add threat protection against knife blades or spiked '' weapons needles etc .
however it 's more effective to have one designed for one or the other .
nij does the protection ratings for ballistic body armor cast does it for bladed/spiked armor .
shoot that sounds pretty dang cool and inexpensive for the quality of content .
one can buy those periodically at our local asian grocers ' or simply be purchased on amazon .

you should take a look at the timeline of each chart and then think again if it 's that similar .
there 's only a single study and its credibility is apparently so good that only breitbart has seen fit to write about it .
do n't you think that a widely popular survey like eurobarometer would have attracted a lot more negative attention over the years if its methodology was actually problematic or is the absence of criticism a part of yet another globalist conspiracy ?
it 's different because the way you 're phrasing it asserts that things only matter if voters think they do measured by popularity .
there are republicans and democrats who will vote for their party every time no matter what and in heavily red/blue districts this means there 's a good chance those candidates will win no matter what .
if the likelihood to win is sure in these seats then your criteria assume that a lot of important things to that candidates ability to ‘govern for the people ' similarly do n't matter and that the parties have no responsibility to put up decent candidates who will serve the country well .

i was in a hardcore raiding guild who did server and some world firsts and that entire guild is completely gone now yeah i spent an hour scrolling the guild list seeing if it was still around ! .
i have to admit that today other than doing a couple mythic dungeons so far that 's all i really have time for anymore .

i like the idea of wifi sharing but i 'd rather pay tokens or anything for wifi without ads .
also as far as i can see it 's merely a utility token and their team consists merely of advisors and managers .
i 'm lacking a technical uniqueness or novelty or breakthrough for this to be a guaranteed worthwhile investment .
the pittance income that hotspot owners will get from this is not even worth the time spent setting this up nor the annoyance of having their customers watch ads .
if that 's what he will share publicly just think of what he hides on that hard drive .

this is how i play monkey island on a vita https i.imgur.com/6e7or9d.jpg
and that 's only the tip of the iceberg of the enjoyment you can get out of gaming https imgur.com/a/z73tk when you start to understand how these magical machines '' work and do n't just submit to the mainstream but muh hyped new gaems ! ''
so no if i hated videogames i would have installed windows 10 and supported denuvo enabled games .
also i 'd be paying to win via microtransactions and joining toxic communities online .
but if that is what modern gaming means today then f*ck modern gaming .
i rather continue to have a sub-par experience '' and have a linux pendrive with my whole rom collection ready to be booted anywhere than locking my pcs under shitty drm protection that only hurt consumers in order to make profits for gaming '' companies that do n't care about us beyond our wallets .
but feel free to convince yourself i am the one that hate videogames ...
oh i know you would n't sell him to us that 's why i said pursuing him would be pointless .
well i do n't expect a phd to just magic up money for me .
however i resent the very widely held belief that a stem phd is a ticket to the middle class .
and while i did n't spend the last 4 years working on my phd to make money it is still a bitter realisation to have that literally staying in the minimum wage job i had as a teenager would have left me much wealthier than thr stem degree and phd route for many decades more .

my guess with the rats is one or more of the players are either a druid who wants to use it to scout via beast sense or animal friendship or a fiend warlock or similar class ability who wants to kill the rats to empower their selves before battle .

trying to think of something to say/a reason to talk to them is what would normally make walking up and introducing yourself to girls awkward but that should n't be the case at a conference people at a conference will be expecting to meet and talk to other people about the obvious topic of the conference itself what did you think of that talk/how that speaker handled ... ?
and it 's a topic everyone should be able to speak about to some extent .
do n't try to focus on any one person but try to talk a wide variety of people you 'll probably find that you 'll run into some of the same people later on and naturally end up speaking more with those you get on well with .
do n't go in expecting to walk away with a girlfriend but just go and enjoy the conference .

the cgi on the little monster that put coins in bb8 and the dog-horses was awful .
i didnt mind the idea behind the scene it was just not done well .
in my mind they should have scrapped the hole dog-horse narrative especially rose and finn fucking riding them and gone for practical effect aliens in the casino .
would have been a much better homage to the original cantina scene
i 'm sorry what do you do for a living ?
turn the tropican military into a redshirt horde by building only barracks and having the lowest budget forcing you to rely on soldier spam against rebels riots and invasions oh yeah and i 'd recommend surrounding your palace with towers for the eventual coups because of poor soldiers .

i know a good amount of those shots missed fair and square .
that 's fine i was frustrated and shot poorly after the first handful .
but those are n't what i 'm talking about .
timing those shots felt completely impossible because some of them would hit like i expected and some would n't at all .
i tried to fire at the same intervals for whenever he strafed close enough but..well you see what became of that .
he was only at like 200 meters at most and this was n't recorded from the replay .
there 's distance and bullet drag to consider but they should have hit at the same exact place every time .
i 'm no shroud but i 've always been a damn good shot up until 1.0 and shooting people in the face while driving was n't particularly difficult .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again call the police .

the secret to keeping cah interesting is to freshen it up with custom cards .
buy a pack of blank cards and sharpies from the dollar store .
whenever someone has an idea for a card get them to write it down on a card and slip it into the deck .
just do n't let them make a card and put it into their hand or to make the card reference anybody who was n't a pop culture reference .
another house rule we had was that if you 're cards were all crap you could put them into the garbage pile .
at the end of the night we would go through the garbage pile and weed out the crap new ones and the stale old ones .
my friend started off with a boring 1st edition deck and ended up with a awesome custom deck three times the size .

losing weight wo n't make your bone pressed erect penis much bigger what it does is uncover your flaccid size which as you know can become buried in the pubic fat pad known as buried penis syndrome .
also losing weight will make your non bone pressed erect length bigger because more shaft will be exposed .
lastly weight gain or loss does n't effect your girth but cardiovascular changes caused by obesity arteriosclerosis can eventually lead to some shrinkage or erectile dysfunction generally as you get over 45yo .
ooooof course they were..and let me guess an orphanage and petting zoo as well ?
it 's only sick and sociopathic '' if your goal is the destruction of israel .
if you support israel 's right to exist and to defend itself against terrorists of all stripes then it 's a natural consequence of war .
you do n't to exist at the expense of another people .
you do n't get to just say that another people 's destruction is necessary for your own survival .
normal people would see two bad guys and encourage them to kill each other so that there are no more bad guys .
you've chosen the side of all the bad guys .
they chose a side amongst radical islamists just like they did when they supported hamas .
i care the most about israel 's continued survival which is made exponentially more certain with a strong nuclear deterrent .
and of course its moral for decades the surrounding muslim countries have done everything in their power to annihilate the jewish state and perpetrate another holocaust .
but we 've established that you 've thrown down with the bad guys so i do n't care what you think is moral your moral sense is let 's say slightly retarded .
yeah so those oppressed blacks can go fuck themselves right ?
that 's the opposite of the jewish humanitarian spirit i was raised with .
so muslim countries that oppress their population are bad but white christian nations that do it not only get a pass they get rewarded .

one thing people do n't always realize about sf is that there is a lot of rent control and california has a law that limits your property tax increases to 2 a year .
so if you have had your apartment 10-20 years you are probably paying 1/3 what goes into those cost of living estimates .
likewise my wife and i bought our house for 550k 15 years ago it 's worth around 1.7m now .
we pay around 3000 a month for mortgage taxes and insurance .
renting a house like ours in our neighborhood is approaching 6000 a month .
so yeah her salary is higher because the overall cost of living is high taxes cost of goods etc but it 's very possible and even likely that person has a housing cost that 's much lower than market rates and so is doing really really well .

rofl i have had a habit for decades when people discourse on something they feel is important and weighty and i do n't give a shit i deadpan reply ... fascinating ... '' .
it does n't work in this context because you showed what happened .
need less than 19 points from j.elliott to win but for some reason i 'm really nervous lol
yeah i think you 're right about a lot of this .
plus it does n't help that i wrote all this before op asked for deontological perspectives .
here 's what the main thing i 'm thinking here is the santa lie hurts few gives joy to many and is unclear as an act of disrespect toward persons .
it may very well be that most people in the world think that lying is never right and if it 's ok to tell the santa lie at all then it is only a small exception to the rule .
what i think i can say with certainty is that given the state of the parts of the world that perpetuate the santa lie that telling the santa lie is a definite exception to the rule that lying is never right .
i understand that there 're many parties such as strict deontologists both secular and religious that would object and say that it is n't an exception because it promotes distrust and disrespect for agency .
throw my contrived case out completely all i 'm saying is that the moral harm that the santa lie causes would be about the same as the moral loss of everyone doing what 's right according to the deontologist .
if two worlds have forseeably similar moral consequences then maybe the decider is the deontic reason to go with the non-santa lie world but maybe the noble lie is the deontic reason to with the pro-santa lie world .
for me to see this only deontically and by the way deontic in a abrahamic and kantian way not in a contractarian way is not a full consideration of the moral aspects .
to judge the santa lie as immoral is about as morally charitable as judging the raising of children in no-other-given-options religious environments as immoral
as for the judgement that lying is never right i 'd have to say more about why i do n't buy the deontic approach and why a more mixed-system approach is better and that 's too much for a post .
but yeah you 're right to challenge me because i 'm roughly coming with the very american secular semi-analytic semi-pragmatic perspective which is by far not popular in the grand scheme of the world and probably for at least decent reasons .
a lot of the zones in the previous expansions will have legion-style level scaling implemented .

my critique is not on the video itself but on the video description .
some people when they like a video they think oh this video is good i am going to check the description to know more about it .
probably because both sides are closer to this than they 'd ever admit .
and if they can convince people to let them attack the 'other side ' with impunity they 'll take the opportunity .
after all they 're slaying dragons with every punch something that makes everyone feel warm and fuzzy .

house starlaaa ... is the original home of the party 's bard then rogue then sorcerer all played by the same girl .
the pcs were refugees of the disaster 12 years ago which was shrouded by mystery until the party showed up .
their god aule was defeated and imprisoned by the evil gygax the city was destroyed and the ruling family the starlaaa ... s were scattered .
tracking other remnants of the house starlaa ... natasha of house starlaaa ... found the party shortly after her sister cen of house starlaaa ... was murdered by the evil gygax in the first battle for the temple of hera .
natasha led the party to the ruins at the request of brother tith of the order of brotherhood .
they fought to the inner chamber of the temple of aule where natasha removed her own eye in order to wield the magical eye and reclaim her place in the house .
this opened the door to the inner chamber in which the god aule was imprisoned .
they freed him and got the help of his purple wyrm ched .
now the party and the worm march on the evil gygax for revenge .

how do i get the transaction confirmed or cancelled ?

thanks some good points there for me to consider .
1 when i was single a few years ago i did n't think i could have been in a relationship with a guy but now i the thought does cross my mind .
2 he does have a plan eventually a house will come up at his work but he 's defiantly mooching .

3 i try my best not to think about him when masturbating and mostly can get away with it other times when it comes into my head not only can i not cum if i try to think about anything else it then gets him stick in my head for the rest of the night .
4 i think this is probably the best thing i can do for now to work on it .
5 my sex drive has completely dropped off probably only had sex twice in the last few months .
she 's still keen to initiate things but i just ca n't get in the mood .

i can see the outline of that stocking and it 's honestly homophobic that there 's no full version .
the way it reads is just aggressive even after knowing i misinterpreted it i can still see why the initial takeaway was muddled .
felt like you were referring to me as one of the people who sees hello games as hardworking angels .
why give due respect ? it 's a dumb pandering mindless take that does n't deserve respect .
it 's not against the law so there is no similar scale
definitely nothing but risk monopoly axis allies twilight imperium a game of thrones ogre 7 ages the republic of rome diplomacy and finally codenames for brevity .
but i startrted working at 19 so i think it helped me a lot .

the reasoning behind luke turning on the saber was n't just sensing a little darkness but the vision he had you 've met star wars right visions are incredibly potent he did n't go into the tent to kill ben but rather confront him about the darkness he felt in training but when he reached into his mind he saw something darker than he had ever seen yeah vader sucked but atleast he had good intentions going to the dark side kylo is evil to be evil that 's way worse .
the biggest wrong part was when you said luke could n't sense the growing darkness he explicitly says he did sense it .
edit also i have yet to see a single vision not come completely true in star wars so there 's that as well .
it took less than a week to finish it initially .
then i added the extended bonus tracks after they came out a few days later .
since then i 've released a couple updates polishing the tracks and added the remixes in this update .

a staff member of rookie girl group loona has been accused stealing the private information of fans and harassing them via text .
after receiving reports that some fans were privately contacted by staff members loona 's agency blockberry creative released an official response .
we received reports that a number of fans have had their private information leaked after the fansign event that happened at youngpoong bookstore on december 23rd .
if there is anyone that was directly affected please contact us .
​​email bbcreative blockberrycreative.com the details of what happened to you and the circumstances surrounding the incident.
the staff member apparently copied private information from fans who attended loona member yves‘s fansign event and contacted them through kakaotalk .
staff ​​i 'm sorry are you the person who was at the fan sign a while ago ?
​​it 's just that you were so cute that i looked up your ticket and found your number .
i was just wondering if you had a boyfriend .
the staff member reportedly contacted multiple fans with similar messages .
jesus ... that might be the cruelest bad beat i 've ever seen in 20 years of playing ff .

hello i plan on coming out to my sister via text soon and i would like a second opinion or advice on what i 'm going to tell her .
can i tell you something important and can you keep it a secret ? ''
i am pretty sure i have gender dysphoria which is where you are uncomfortable with your assigned gender and because of this i feel like i am a girl .
i become extremely anxious and uncomfortable when i notice something about myself that i do n't like .
i ddnt know how to tell this too so i choose you because i trusted you the most to keep this a secret for a while i really hope you will supportive of this .
you probably have questions so if you want to ask you can go ahead . ''
should i add or remove any parts of it ?
i 'd really appreciate advice on how it sounds !
i recently got into bmx riding and it 's been fun so far.all im doing with it now is riding long distance but i want to build up the confidence to do tricks in future .
for example what tricks should i learn in order in order to improve my skills ?
all i can do now is lift the front wheel up but i 'm struggling to lift my back wheel up .
his first two losses were when he was young not yet in his prime .
that means that the first fight was a fluke and does n't count .
same thing with the bradley fight was a fluke and a robbery .
the juan manwell markez fight was just a lucky punch .
the mayweather fight was also a robbery and manny had an injured shoulder .
if you watch it in slow motion manny dearly won .
horn should 've been disqualified for fighting dirty too .
i bought me1 and me2 on steam a few years back for my boyfriend .
he 's just now getting around to playing them and i 'm only just now realizing that there 's no dlc for them on steam .
totally my mistake i bought some deluxe edition combo and just assumed the dlc was included .
is there any way to get the dlc for the steam versions now that bioware social is gone ?
or do i really have to re purchase the whole thing on origin for him ?
i suppose it does n't matter too much for me1 .
he has n't finished that yet so i have some time but i really loved the me2 dlc and would love for him to be able to experience those too .
just hoping i do n't have to re-buy the game .
i 've seen some of my opposition do some really stupid stuff so i wonder sometimes if all of the people are real users .
i 'm so immensely bored but at the same time i do n't feel like doing anything .
i do n't feel like going outside watching movies or tv is n't enjoyable anymore games are n't that fun anymore i do n't have anyone to talk to .
all i 'm doing during my 6 week break is sleeping listening to music to distract myself and browsing facebook and reddit .
there does n't seem to be anything i can do to help myself .
i can never know what to trust it seems that a lot of antiviruses act like a virus themselves so i never get one .
i recently started playing again last seriously played during s1 and i noticed that there are so many icons and objective makers in the screen that during teamfights there were certain times i could n't see anything because 4 or 5 of the markers were on top of each other .
i 've been playing the game for a while i 'm not sure i need a permanent marker to show me where the objective is .
when will you be able to make aberration kibble ?
rai needs to reach 130b market cap to cost 1000 per coin .
considering how much total market cap grew this year it seems that being in top 10 could be enough to reach that .
as a person who plays against bots quite a bit in the objective modes i find it kind of mundane that we just get a random assortment of ais every single match and if we keep going with it we eventually get level 3 bots that are still just a random lot .
would it be feasible to make it so that occasionally there is like a special squad of say 4 knight/viking/samurai heroes with similar emblems and decorative designs for theme purposes that are all either level 2 or 3 ?
this idea could be mixed and changed around to fit other scenarios too and the map as well samurai assaulting on the shard the vikings raiding at sanctuary bridge the knights invading the river fort .
again just a suggestion to add flavor for those who tend to play against ais more .
i play me3 on xbox and have the hardest time getting money and thus guns and characters .
i have the avenger x and a paladin i but very few other weapons .
i 've found that human/asari vanguards are good to grind through bronze challenges but the cash/games ratio is crap when arsenal and character packs are 99k each but if i play silver and gold i end up getting carried cuz my guns are useless against enemies past ways 4 on silver and 3 on gold .
what can i do to make the grind easier without spending money ?
let 's see if anyone is old enough to remember that line
i remember seeing this line in a book back in the 80 's and the mesmerising patterns this made on my commodore 64 as a child .
i think i 've re-created it faithfully in python using the little bit of knowledge i have possibly could have done it more streamline given more knowledge but it 's passable as is if you can tighten it up please show us .
ps even downloaded the c64.ttf and used conemu got a fairly faithful representation of the old program that way
while true print random.choice ' ' ' ' end ''
what are you supposed to do when you drop connection and are n't able to connect again ?
i was just in a game and dropped connection could n't connect internet was fine cause i was on voice had to abandon cause the game would n't reconnect even after a few minutes .
i 've been going to sharks game since 95 but in january i 'll be going to my first game with my 5 month old daughter my xmas gift was tickets and headphones for her .
have any of us done anything similar in the past ?
any advice/rules regarding what i can bring into the tank ?
it 's basically where you post three similar songs together or just three really good songs in one post using youtube videos .
i 'm pretty sure this has already been spoken about but i really need to talk about my prospective on this issue '' .
this recently just happened and i enjoyed it but .
i would like to see one thing added to it for next year .
world cup qualifiers '' now similar to the football soccer world cup there are qualifiers for each continent to compete in the world cup .
this is something i 'd love to see osu also do .
as a player that represents the country of georgia i love representing the country and would hate for my flag to change but i 'd love to just play for my country .
i am aware that this does take money obviously and lots of effort to host the world cup .
but seeing other countries that are not as popular also compete '' would be awesome .
and the feeling for other players from obscure nations to represent their country in osu !
i could n't imagine how amazing it would feel .
i also understand that some games would be useless because one country would have a huge amount of great players vs another country with basically no one .
this obviously does not have to include every country because obviously .
but i 'd like to see qualifiers for teams in the top 100 .
anyways thank you for reading and seeing my views on the world cup .
and remember i 'm not saying the osu world cup sucks i enjoyed every single moment of it .
hello i am having an issue where the internal temperature of my house drops much lower than the eco setting .
i have been gone for a week with an eco mode setting of 65 f. i checked my nest app tonight and it is reading a temperature of 47 f. after manually setting the house to 70 f the app says the house is heating but over an hour later and the app is now reading out 46 f .
i looked through the support site but could n't find my issue .
i was diagnosed with narcolepsy a little over two months ago after being diagnosed with sleep apnea a couple moths earlier .
once i was diagnosed with sleep apnea i was put on nuvigil and they started the paperwork for xyrem .
somehow the paperwork for the xyrem was lost but that is what it is .
after starting the nuvigil i continued to be tired .
i described myself at that point as being more of an exhausted zombie than just being outright asleep but i thought the nuvigil might be helping some .
my blood pressure went a little nutty after getting thr nuvigl so i was given some blood pressure medicine .
last week i had my follow up and she upped my nuvigigil since i was still experiencing the daytime sleepiness .
with the new dosage i get this wave of extreme exhaustion within an hour of taking it .
i also become extremely nervous and paranoid get heart palpitations and chest pain have difficulty forming complete thoughts or even having a thought get dizzie become overly emotional feel completely disconnected from my body fall alseep when doing things and i just feel like crap .
when it 's real bad i just wish i would pass out so it would stop since i ca n't always fall alseep when it 's at it worse .
i actually stood at the bottom of the stairs for 5 minutes thinking i need to go up them .
i called the doctor 's office today to make an appointment since this just is n't working and it 's destroying my life .
i informed them that i will be stopping the nuvigil immediately since i just can not function with the side effects .
the receptionist informed me that i needed to be on the nuvigil for 30 days to get the xryem .
she also said she would let the doctor know .
i 've already taken nuvigil at a lower dose for more than 30 days so i do n't know if this will cause problems with getting the xyrem but i do n't care .
i would much rather go back to just be exhausted instead of my current exhausted zombie who ca n't do anything .
i 'm in the market for a new one seems like auctions on insta seem to be the popular route .
i have struggled with bpd for a while now .
it recently was the reason i lost one of my best friends '' and my now ex-boyfriend .
there are a couple of things some people close to me have consistently told me that drove my crazy no pun intended
some of the things that i ca n't stand hearing are
1 i think you like being depressed because it 's comfortable and what you know .
yup i 'm choosing to wake up with pure anguish anxiety and no hope .
2 you just need to retrain your mind to not dwell on the negative and replace it with something positive .
3 you 're not really suicidal because no one would threaten it this much .
like no dude i legit struggle with it every day and use most my energy to stop myself from thinking about it .
4 oh i also hear the fake it until you make it '' advice all the time .
5 just be grateful you 're not this '' this just makes me more sad .
no i 'm not going to be happy because somebody has it worse than me .
i 'm not going to use someone else 's shitty life situation to feel better about myself .
any misconceptions or no shit '' advice you just ca n't stand ?

i finally got to 8 hearts with sebastian so without thinking i gave him the bouquet as soon as it was available .
i then found out that i can miss heart events and even miss them permanently .
i really do n't wan na miss any of the events and i 'm already at 9 hearts with him and it 's winter now and it does n't rain during winter unless i use rain totem which i do n't have and i ca n't make at the moment
so i 'm finding myself in quite a pickle .
can i access the heart event that i was supposed to access at 8 hearts even though i 'm at 9 hearts now or should i stop talking to him for awhile and maybe give him gifts he does n't like until i 'm back at 8 hearts ?
today i learned after having months and months of data overage bills etc that android phones specifically the galaxy s7 i believe have a setting that is defaulted to on .
this setting allows the phone to get a boost from its data even if it is connected to a wifi signal .
well it seemed that after checking the history of our cell phone use almost 90 of our data usage was by the only android phone in the house .
we were getting monthly overage charges costing sometimes hundreds of dollars .
my son who uses this phone denies usage in this amounts we have a 10gig plan and insists that at school and home he is connected to the wifi .
well multiple support calls later i learn about this setting that is defaulted as on .
we have fixed it on this phone and will now watch and see over the next month if the data usage amount for that phone decreases we will know then that it was the phone .
make sure you check this setting on your androids it 's hidden in the advanced wifi settings .
iphones have a similar thing called wifi assist that you should also turn off if you happen to be reading this and also have an iphone or ipad .

ok so two years ago i started dating someone .
it was all going really well except a few weeks into dating he got a job in london where he worked 7 days a week doing nights for the next 5-6 months .
i would go a see him once every few weeks it worked out well as my best friend lived in london too .
he would come see me on bank holidays etc .
i really started to fall for him however i felt he was n't as into it .
we were never official and when i mentioned it he said he was n't sure as he wanted to do more travelling etc .
he was due to go on holiday so we said let 's talk about it properly when you get back .
anyways i found out he slept with someone else on holiday i tried to forgive he was very sorry cried etc but i could n't do it and ended it .
so all in all it had been 7-8 months of seeing each other .
since then we have slept together on and off .
however feb this year i started working as an escort .
we met this year in nov again just for some fun and i ended up telling him about it he was so understanding and non judgemental about i can literally talk to him about anything he 's always there for me he really is a lovely person .
we have got so close way more affection than last time more open with each other .
he confessed to me when we first started dating he slept with two escorts i was so hurt by it and cried so much .
i did kiss two people that i admitted to .
the way he sees it is it was apparently within the first month of dating we barely knew each other or what was going to happen .
i want a relationship with him but he says he ca n't nothing to do with what i do plus i would obviously stop doing it .
whenever it comes to me wanting to take it further he says he ca n't it 's his issue that he needs to see a therapist about he said this when i found out about him cheating ' he tells me he loves me and has never been so attracted to someone so i do n't get it ? yet he wants to carry on with what we are doing .
i 'm away travelling at the moment i will be for 7 weeks .
i 've tried to tell him to delete my number i 've told him i do n't want to see him again but he does n't take notice and i 'm too weak to block him .
i 've deleted his number in the hope he wo n't text me for a while .
i do want to stay in touch with him but i need to get over him first .
i ca n't get him out of my head but i need to .

i need laptop for work but its impossible to work when the laptop is ultra slow .

the guy said it was okay its just a mac thing !
you go to school for fucking 6 1/2 hours constantly taking it up the ass figuratively from dickhead students and fucktard teachers .
then you go home which should be time that does n't involve learning shit you do n't care about .
but no these cunt-ass teachers will not accept only 6 1/2 hours of torturing you .
so they unload a huge amount of this ass discharge they call homework on you .
it can range from a simple math worksheet with joke you must fill in when you 're done no biggie to a fucking ton of work containing bookwork projects unfinished classwork studying for a test you know you 're going to fail either way and book reports on a book you did n't care to read .
if you spent fucking hours on this shit and ended up going to sleep at 4 in the motherfucking morning these assrammers wo n't even check the damn homework the next day .
oh but if you forgot to note down the homework did the wrong page or just did n't give two shits about it and did n't do it the assholes will ask you turn it in .
all in all school sucks classwork sucks teachers suck students suck and homework is the fucking scum of the earth .
i 'm supposed to be doing my homework right now which is a research paper on a book i did n't have the time to read and to study for a math test i 'm probably going to bomb anyway .
except i do n't give two shits about it so i 'm writing a definition for urban dictionary .
whenever i get a notification from snapchat it mutes whatever i have playing .
if i 'm listening to spotify it mutes it .
also when i open snapchat it automatically pauses spotify .
i do n't remember it always being like this .
i 'm pretty set on the helor but i 'm not sure which burr to get or if it 's worth it to get both .
i mostly use my french press so i was thinking the conventional burr would make sense .
but i 'm looking at getting either a clever dripper or aeropress or possibly a moka pot which i know requires a finer grind .
am i really going to regret getting only the conventional burr ?
edit the aergrind is in stock here https prima-coffee.com/equipment/knock/aergrind and now i 'm not so set on the helor ...
hello my fellow redditors for a little over 2 months i think i have had my reddit now .
and i do like the app but i just do n't know how to engage in topics and properly use the app .
i do like alot of the subreddits and the front page but how can i ease into the app better and learn to make my own post ?
i 'm a very interesting person ... well i think i am and i have alot of things i could post but i just do n't due to insecurity .
i 've just installed i2p on my ubuntu 16.04/lenovo yoga and am running the i2prouter .
i 've installed privoxy and configured firefox to route all i2p sites to localhost:4444 and am able to view the i2p console on localhost:7657 .
as of now there are 266 known peers and 22/159 active peers .
all of them time out with a page showing the message website unreachable '' from the i2p proxy the page has the i2p logo and links to configuration help addressbook .
so as far as i can imagine they removed all the people on pikes peak but forgot to remove the respawn triggers that followed the people .
this leads to the game punishing me for a tiny mess-up back of car swings out of the road and into where the people used to be triggering a respawn .
is there any possibility this will ever get fixed ?

i went to my desktop email app and clicked the approve '' link to confirm the transaction .
like it always does safari opened up and i logged in ... and nothing happened .
i spent 5 hours on telegram last night during bitgrails eth debacle so got limited to zero help .
this was after filing tickets 4 days ago and never hearing back .
i bought a bit more today ... ath ... again move past that part i have faith it will grow and i thought i 'd try a second time to see if the still pending '' tx was a one off .
after cursing myself twice in 5 minutes for buying ath and then for being an idiot for trying to send again my spidey sense tingled .
i put it together that i had n't been logged into safari when i clicked confirm '' in my email .
i clicked confirm '' again and glory glory glory it said confirmed '' on bitgrail .
within 30 seconds i had my xrb in my wallet .
i quickly scoured for the confirmation email from 6 days ago and clicked confirm '' ... and 30 seconds later i had my xrb .
so if you 're stuck in pending '' maybe my trick will work for you .
for your sanity i hope it does with prices mooning like they did today .

yesterday my wife bp2 and i had an argument .
the interesting thing is that her disorder was n't really part of it .
we did ad hoc some rules to make sure we did n't trigger her disorder but it did n't interfere with us dealing with our issues .
we 've worked for twenty years to get here .
figuring out her meds her treatment plan her triggers .
estimated year of release havent got a clue it used dualshock so 1997/1998
notable gameplay mechanics played like a twin stick shooter was 1v1 with another opponent game field was a ring which didnt allow you to leave
other details i found this game for cheap at a massive book sale and i have n't been able to recall it since if it even exists all that i think i can remember is
a lot of black/red as in outside of its vector graphics the backgrounds were pure black
was a third person view like it was some sort of mech fight
could move around the ring but could n't leave the ring
pretty sure it had boss stages with the classic danger !

it 's been rumored here https www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products and here https 9to5mac.com/2017/10/12/whats-the-best-qi-wireless-charger-for-iphone-8-and-iphone-x that apple has restricted charging speeds to all other chargers except the two they the offer belkin https www.apple.com/shop/product/hl802/belkin-boost-up-wireless-charging-pad ? fnode=42 and mophie https www.apple.com/shop/product/hl812/mophie-wireless-charging-base ? fnode=42 .
if that 's the case that 's completely okay .
what is not okay is the lack of an official response to these claims .
2nd response different rep ended the chat as soon as the question came up https imgur.com/eilx0ii
this is to no fault of the representatives they only know the official response which is silence .
here is the memory slug of my thoughts on this figure
so ... i found my first power of the primes figure and it could n't be a better fit jazz .
the mold is definitely a new take on jazz but pays tribute .
the colors and paint scheme is g1 to the core .
the head sculpt is solid and a wonderful rendition of our favorite blue visored special ops autobot .
the transformation is pretty solid with quote a few nods to the g1 transition .
the feet and lower legs and the barrel chest are easily the most stand out of this .
they are made into the arms this way and it leads to one of my biggest gripes about some figures the hands have kibble underneath of them so they induce a little hokiness '' about .
his gun is a solid nod of his g1 version and goes well with him .
the prime master '' piece connects to his torso/gut .
it forms a left or right hand in his gestalt form .
he can also form a leg without the piece .
this piece also has a removable yellow part where a prime master can fit .
the instructions show that he holds the small yellow piece as a gun in this case .
i would just insert in into one of his peg holes on his forearms or on his back .
i have n't experimented yet but it looks as if a head ma ... '' errrr titan master '' would fit as well but it would be showing a face .
this part pegs into the back sort of like sun streaker in alt mode .
in bot mode it can peg to his torso/gut forearm or in my case i placed it on his back .
it is a little low but i flipped it up adjusted the double thumbs and extended the fingers and it looks like a power pack of sorts .
he is a great figure and i ca n't wait to see what is next .
hello i have lurked here a few times but first time actually asking for advice .
so basically i am selling my home and after i pay of the rest of the balance and debt i have i will have 90k plus left over .
i was initially going to just going buy a new home but i do not want to buy something i 'll be unhappy with or in over my head with if i go with a fha loan .
so i want basically invest the money for one year because i will be living with family for one year to save up around another 35k and have a better down payment on a house i like .
i was looking at a online savings account ally bank specifically or a money market account but not sure if they are the best options or not .
i know i wo n't get crazy amounts of money back but i would love to get anything back even 1000 dollars for having money just sit around would be great .
so at the end of a year i will take most if not all the money out to use .
any advice would be great sorry for formatting i am mobile and i do n't really post so i am bad at this thank you .
anyone know why i ca n't adjust my cpu frequency in bios ?
i 'm using a msi b350 pro mobo and a ryzen 3 1300x .
i turned game boost on and everything and now it 's at 3.7ghz .
i want to see if i can get it to 3.8ghz .
if you have a relatively new card can provide benchmark pics with a timestamp and can give me a reasonable price then i 'm interested in your card .
not only limited to the cards in the description .
at the moment i 'm running a 7970 so the new card should be a decent jump from that .
shipping will be to belgium so please take that into consideration .
so i just finished season 1 tonight and the last move where the group does all 5 of the movements at the cafeteria got me upset .
the old lady told oa to keep the move a secret but the group did it in front of everyone and knowing social media these days someone recorded it and uploaded to the internet .
i think the fbi agent '' is trying to obtain the 5th move for whatever reason and just found it .
a few months ago i was being a recluse in my room just reading .
i was interested in quantum physics and once i got the jist of it i started reading about psychology philosophy religion chemistry astronomy and calculus .
i suddenly noticed a strange connection between all of these things .
they seemed to be all connected on a higher '' much more basic fundamental level .
a realization that the entire universe is a consciousness of itself .
suddenly something clicked and all of reality started coming together .
i noticed how a certain sound outside was going to make my dad talk about a completely unrelated subject or know exactly what my delusional '' grandma was randomly rambling about .
i was talking to a physics graduate with 5 phds my dads friend that is also our neighbor and even he could n't answer the questions i was posing because my dad confessed that he called my dad and asked him how i knew so much about this field .
i started writing quantum mechanical equations ranging from the theoretical undiscovered space-time fields discovery that there is strong evidence that the field that unites all of space-time is consciousness to a set of new equations with proofs .
after a few days i was hanging out with friends and i was able to somehow implant my ideas into their heads without even talking about it .
i was somehow visualizing all of the neural connections in their brain and how they were connecting us together via this higher '' field and that 's what got me to do it .
after talking with another one of my friends it felt like i could see his past '' lives or what i mean is lives in parallel universes .
i could see his face morph between all of the other physical beings he was .
i noticed how reality is an illusion a very strong illusion .
another instance was when i created some sort of telepathic connection between a friend and i mind you this all happened within a week .
he and i had this strange indescribable connection where we could think each others thoughts without actually talking .
and he felt it too i have tangible proof of him texting me of how insane that feeling was .
what ticked this moment was a realization of the progression of collective consciousness and the illusion of time .
this realization i can only describe as the universal principle of the progression of evolution .
how things evolved was from single-cellular bacteria to multi cellular bacteria to organisms the same pattern of how gasses organized into gaseous stars which organized into solid matter and the same way insects evolved independently but then evolved into a collective hive mind '' .
everything in our universe at some point reaches this collectivization '' .
i realized that there was no limit to the organization of consciousness and i instantly became aware of the conscious field around us .
when something is natural '' to you you do n't even notice it until you do .
i realized i possessed the very tools to manipulate consciousness to my will .
but this brought me into a terrifying existential dilema asking the question of wether god is dead ?
if i am actively shaping the reality around me then am i the only living god '' ?
furthermore when i had this connection with my friend he started going off on what an amazing feeling it was and he randomly started talking about how reality is an extension '' of me and i just needed to think '' about it and i 'd be able to move things with my mind .
it was very strange for me because he was not the type of guy to talk about psychic abilities neither was i .
it was a feeling like i was looking at myself from the future telling me all these things .
he told me how all of humans reaching this level of sentience are eternalized gods .
then he was warning me that i needed to stop thinking so much because he said and i quote you need to stop thinking so much because it keeps killing us .
just relax and try not to think so much . ''
this really shook me because it almost felt like i could understand how i was hogging '' the consciousness of reality all to myself .
he also mentioned that we are all supercomputers of an ancient alien race .
it felt like reality was some sort of conscious experiment .
the wealthiest innovator in the united states even says elon musk that there is a one in a hundred million chance that we are in base '' reality .
our reality most likely is a sub-simulation of other simulations that stemmed from the original simulation .
all of this during the experience i developed some sort of extreme empathy for humanity .
it felt like i could feel every single persons life miseries all at the same time .
it made me want to fix humanity for everyone .
i would focus on someone and they would end up calling me/texting me literally within 15 minutes .
this happened with my ex one of my friends that i rarely talk to over the phone my sisters ex 's all in the same day .
like i would think my sister was really happy with her ex i wish they would get back together '' i get in the shower 15 minutes later i get out and my sister tells me how her ex just texted her he has n't contacted her for over 4 months at that same exact point and then i confessed to her and she was happy as it was but i could feel her facade and i knew she wasnt happy .
the next day her other ex contacted her and he came over and they had dinner and he slept over this was their first encounter in over a year my sister is 30 btw .
i know this seems far fetched but i swear on my life that this happened .
i even made him a website that same day for his painting business because i wanted to help him out since he was struggling so much he was homeless at the time .
it felt like i could read any persons life like a book just by looking at them .
well what happened was i was freaking out over all of these things happening to me i started having a panic attack which i never had before so i drove to the hospital .
they put me in the er and i told them some of the things that were happening to me and ofcourse they put me in psychiatric care .
they did a drug test on me which all came back clean .
i was locked in a 10 by 10 foot room for 3 days .
something crazy happened the next morning at this facility .
they brought me breakfast and as i opened everything up i had this strange realization that i could physically sense the consciousness in matter .
things that have freedom of will are higher up '' on this gradient that is the conscious spectrum .
a rock is on the bottom because a rock ca n't think and move itself to a certain location .
it is manipulated by other matter around it it has very little freedom of will .
a rabbit has much more freedom of will as it can think itself of where it wants to go but it is not that high on the conscious spectrum because the only matter around itself that it can manipulate is the shrubs and other rabbits .
a human is even higher on this conscious spectrum a being that is capable of building machines out of lower-conscious matter and manipulating reality to the extremes nuclear bombs can reshape countries we have the freedom to travel to other planets but i noticed that this freedom was still very limited .
by this pattern you can see that the higher you are on the conscious spectrum the less you are manipulated by the reality around you instead the more control '' you have for the reality around you .
a rock is only manipulated by its environment and it ca n't do anything on it 's own so it has little freedom '' while a human can do everything on it 's own and it is n't very reliant on it 's environment to have freedom '' .
what is the next '' step of freedom on this conscious spectrum ?
being able to manipulate every form of consciousness remember consciousness is everything everything is energy to that being 's will .
as they brought me my breakfast in the psychiatric unit i opened the box and put a carton of milk on the table .
i had an utter trip '' through time where i had this sort of empathy '' for the carton of milk sitting on the table .
i noticed that the fundamental stuff making up everything is just this one definition consciousness and that reality and us are the same but humans love to put labels on everything as natural '' artificial '' or special '' to feed the instinctive greed they have for what is better .
humans are still animals and it will take a long time for us to evolve to suppress this greed .
so as i felt this empathetic connection to what seems to be just a stupid random carton of milk i realized that all consciousness is equal no matter what it is .
it all plays a part in the survival of consciousness .
so i stared at this carton of milk and something happened .
i focused on the carton and imagined a pendulum type of motion and the milk carton started rocking back and forth .
the door was closed there were no windows no vents just me the breakfast and the carton .
i was n't even surprised because having such an internalized connection to reality made perfect sense and this did not catch me off guard at all .
i felt like i had a conscious connection to the planet itself and to the star systems themselves .
it was very strange all in all.. just as my friend said only one day prior that reality is an extension of me '' and that i just needed this realization to move things with my mind that 's exactly what happened .
what had happened left a lurking effect on me is reality real ?
it seemed like i was playing some sort of game being able to do this to physical matter .
i felt like i was on the wrong planet .
i got myself thinking that the only way all of these fields could be connected would be if we were in some sort of simulation on an alien computer .
which was strange because my friend also mentioned on that same night the same thing .
and is also something my sister 's ex mentioned while talking to me even though we were n't even on the topic of consciousness that same day .
well after spending two weeks in a mental hospital they fed me a bunch of pills and all of these things went away for the most part .
edit i just remembered when i was very little i was living with my grandma in germany and my mom was working in the u.s.. she got into a car crash that had her hospitalized and i started nagging my grandma my uncle and my aunt who all lived in germany in the same household at the time that my mom 's head hurt .
this was before any of them got the news that she got into an accident .
she was in a coma for 15 hours after she got into a crash as she hit her head on the pillar by the windshield .
the next day when they found out what happened they all freaked out that i knew this .
they are still all alive and still confirm when this happened but i sadly do n't remember it i was too young .
i now have 120k and i am saving the gold packs for toty .
worth calculating if you can do it for profit .
i did have some players from bpm and silver upgrades
i ca n't open the uf packs i won in the events the game give me a connection error and i must log in again i went to thw unclaimed items and try to open the packs again and lost connection everytime anyone have the same problen ?
how do i make sure that i withdraw my entire balance from etherdelta ?

18 year old guy here i utterly hate the gym and exercising .
so i 'm currently in the hunt for a girlfriend and after getting annoyed with the cookie cutter le hit the gym ! ! ''
i 've been trying to go a couple times a week and i 've loathed every second of it it 's just boring to me and it just drags on .
i constantly think about how lame this is and how i 'd rather be doing anything else .
of course i 'm aware that if i want to achieve what i desire it 's a requirement but that tends to make me loathe exercising even more .
i ca n't be the only one who thinks this about exercise so what did men who were in a similar situation do ?
hello guys i 'm relatively new to the community .
pls do n't poison my kool aid now before you guys burn me at the stake and say you hate the game because you suck at it '' hear me out .
halo ce is a masterpiece and a must have for the og xbox however it is n't without flaw .
i feel like the marine ai was just too dumbed down and the pistol wayyy too op .
i tried to get myself comfy with the difficulty on heroic '' but got my ass kicked by elites .
when i got the level halo '' i immediately was murdered by some banshees and grunts .
the assault rifle was pretty much useless on everything that is n't a grunt so i swapped it with a plasma pistol and noob combo 'd my way through that part of the level .
the warthog part was fun but the controls were kind of weird and it did n't help that the marine ai is retarded .
truth and reconciliation '' was super fun for me but the amount of times i had to scavenge ammo by killing ai was ridiculous .
silent cartographer '' was too easy and i did n't feel challenged so i switched the difficulty to legendary .
huge mistake assault on the control room was a fair challenge and now we move on to my favorite level .
343 guilty spark '' is a fucking great level !
the setup and introduction to the flood was flawless !
but the maze of that level confused me and left me wandering for about 35 mins .
as of me typing this i 'm stuck on the library '' level and it sucks major ass .
so i just finished the library '' and it was so relieving !
but now i 'm stuck on two betrayals '' rocket flood keep fucking me up .
after memorizing the flood 's positions two betrayals '' was easy but definitely not my favorite .
i got stuck on the last part keyes '' because those damn black elites can aim so well with grenades .
after about an hour and a half due to trial and error i got past keyes '' and moved on to the maw '' .
the only trouble i had was getting blasted by hunters and fuel rod grunts .
and the warthog run did n't feel as epic as it should 've given the fact that i can never get used to the damn controls for that thing .
based on some of your comments i can assume multiplayer is better ?
what happens if a space marine eats tyranid brains ?
send me 2 photos at a time i pick one and give you a stroke count

some channels on twitch i watch one ad and i 'm done for a while .

unbreakable kimmy schmidt takes place in the same universe as orange is the new black at the end of an episode one of the characters is sent to litchfield and even talks to black cindy .
orange is the new black is already in the universe because of morley cigarettes .
but law order is a fictional show on unbreakable kimmy schmidt which means that john munch is fictional which makes homicide life on the street and st .
kimmy schmidt simultaneously exists inside and outside of the westphall universe .
this excites me but also makes me wonder what that means for the theory .
pattern index 688 looks exactly the same as 412 1 fire and ice pattern but idk if that means anything for a bowie lol

looking for a recommendation for a 65 '' tv for about 1,250 max .
i 'll add if there is something a bit over 1,250 that is really worth it let me know and i 'll convey that to my friend .

but it seems like my temples are n't coming back and my top is not as thick as i 'd like .
i 'm considering a hair transplant to fill in my temples a little bit and strengthen my hair line .
i assume i should wait until i 'm a full two years on fin before doing anything .
but i have n't found any info on transplant timing on here .
is there a rule of thumb on how when to consider a transplant based on age hair loss and treatment fin length ?

so i 've beaten the game and quickly leveled to 99 killing the 110/130 superbosses and decided i wanted to try making a second team layout composed of nia with ether canons kos herald/azami sheba zeke as a tank electra kassandra newt and morag as a healer dhalia vess ?
so i could use both setups without having to move blades my original is zeke zenobia/pand/vale morag brighid/theory/aegeon and nia dromarch/floren/boreas .
however the ai has become completely and utterly useless .
morag bomb rushes the enemies and stands in front of them like a tank throwing her bitball an inch and refusing to heal .
when i die she does n't revive me like nia would she contines to attack the enemy and often steals zekes aggro as he comes to revive me as tank .
zeke is alright but keeps dying because morag refuses to heal .
am i the only person who has had this problem ?
is it possible each character 's ai is set a certain way regardless of their role ?
does anyone have any tips to alleviate these issues ?
ps i really do n't like rex as a character or design so i do n't use him/want to use him
i 'm traveling tomorrow and have been unable to find a replacement at any retail stores .

i do n't claim to be a crypto guru .
im still relatively new to crypto compared to some .
i do n't want this to be taken as a i know all and you guys know nothing . ''
this is simply a look at the bigger picture and some advice that i 've followed and it has n't let me down .
with the raise of the minimum payout especially after people understandably having their jimmies rustled after the hack there has been an onslaught of posts that have made it very obvious that many are here on the bandwagon and have jumped in without understanding how crypto and nicehash works .
we need to take a step back and think about what 's going on .
and this is advice i 've given every single person who has asked me about getting into crypto .
you need to research what you 're investing in .
blindly investing into anything is just asking for trouble .
now to give some insight on how this relates to the increase in payment threshold .
when nicehash went down i was mining zcash and vertcoin direct .
i had accumulated about 40 worth of coin total between both currencies .
when i tried to cash out the smallest fee i could pay was 20 .
i said heck no and ended up transferring for litecoin and transferring to my main trading stack in gdax .
now with the way nicehash functions their goal is for the user to pay as little fees as possible .
that 40 worth of bitcoin was going to cost me 20 .
well if i had 80 worth of bitcoin that fee would be 20 still .
this is how nicehash gets away with a flat fee .
by grouping more bitcoin into one transaction they can effectively split the fee into a flat rate .
smaller miners are paying a higher percentage in fees in comparison to their earnings than larger miners have to pay .
but this is still the lesser of two evils .
i 'd rather pay the smaller fee of the grouped transaction than pay the fee for my transaction by itself .
so what does raising the minimum withdrawal threshold do ?
and yeah it forces users to keep their btc under someone else 's control .
but the goal is to make the transactions more efficient .
by grouping more btc into each transaction and dividing the fee amongst the miners it not only saves you from having to pay the ridiculous fee of having a solo transaction processes a big yay for small miners but it also keeps it to where they do n't have to raise their flat fees also a yay for smaller miners .
the only downside is that it forces users to keep their btc on a less than ideal wallet format .
note to further cover this topic i am going to edit in a link that goes further into depth than i 'm going .
i just wanted to put it into more simplified terms for readings sake .
tl dr for those who do n't like walls of text ... research .
gain an understanding on how fees work and how nicehash is making it more efficient for the end user .
hey all i was wondering what you guys might be using accessory and aux core wise that seem to be working out well for you !
what 's the reason for the sign on bonuses ?
i 'm sorry for how long this is i do n't really expect anyone to read this i just needed to get this out here .
i 've been seriously considering transitioning for about a year now and it 's been the most depressing time of my life .
i ca n't stand the hair on my face and body other than pubes my legs and feet just look so wrong and i really hate how deep my voice is .
i 've questioned my gender ever since i heard about transgenderism at about 16 and before that i had wanted to be a girl and had experimented with my sisters clothes only a couple of times at about six or seven .
i 've never really accepted the male gender role and have only done it to fit in and not get chastised by my peers i feel so fake acting masculine and hate formal men 's wear .
just before hitting puberty i dreaded hair growing on my face and my voice getting deeper but i kind of just accepted it during my teens and i feel like i 've just been a husk of a person all these years existing rather than living .
since puberty i 've felt like my chest shouldnt be flat and i get this unnatural feeling from it especially when thinking about it .
i ca n't stand growing any more hair on my face and body .
i 'm not sure if i 'll ever pass with my masculine face 6ft broud shoulders and deep voice .
i feel like i 'll be unhappy living as a guy and unhappy living as a non passing trans woman .
my situation has got me so depressed and i see no way to get better .
i 've accepted that i 'm trans and i was fairly happy being able to say that but both paths forward look very grim .
anyone know a nice place i can get some jeans tailored ?
i read somewhere someone got weapons from trooper crates instead of meeting the kill requirement .
i have been with my partner for 7 years and he has been very emotionally abusive in the past .
we have been doing well in the last couple of months and i was starting to feel like maybe we are past all the problems we had .
however i 've noticed that over the past week my anxiety has gotten increasingly worse .
i 'm terrified that things between us are collapsing even though there is no evidence of this .
i 'm starting to feel like i need to get out of the relationship but i 'm feeling guilty because there is n't anything bad going on at the moment and i feel like i have no specific reason to leave .
i also feel like i will lose everything if i leave him because our lives are intertwined and i have no friends of my own .

this is a good question but before i tell you how bitcoin implementing the lightning network will affect litecoin first we need to understand the lightning network itself as well as how bitcoin and litecoin function as currencies .
first of all the lightning network is not exclusive only to bitcoin litecoin was the first to activate this new technology .
the lightning network is a technology upgrade that will potentially allow instant transactions as well as instant micro-transactions the instant transactions will be powered using smart contracts yes you heard it smart contracts will be coming to bitcoin .
once the lightning network is implemented bitcoin 's transaction fees will be drastically reduced and we will have almost instant transactions at the time of me writing this a bitcoin transaction takes an average of about 78 minutes .
for the people who say bitcoin can only be used as a store of value due to it 's limited supply they are forgetting that a bitcoin is divisible just like a dollar usd euro eur € or pound gbp £ dollars have cents euros have cents as well pounds have pence .
you do not need a full dollar to purchase anything you can use even as little as 1 cent or as much as 1 million dollars the same principle applies to bitcoin .
one bitcoin can be divided into satoshis there are 100,000,000 satoshi 's or sats in one bitcoin and 100 satoshi 's are currently worth about 1 cent 0.00000100 btc .
right now a bitcoin transaction will cost you anywhere from 7 to 30 when the blockchain is under heavy load and since 100 satoshi 's are equal to just over 1 cent micro-transactions are currently impossible and the lightning network aims to change that .
the lightning network wo n't require miners to validate transactions due to smart contracts the transaction will be carried out offline and the bitcoin blockchain will record the transaction after it has been completed .
removing the middlemen bitcoin miners from the process will really make bitcoin retail ready you could buy a bar of candy for 10,000 satoshis about 1 dollar at the time of me writing this and the transaction would happen instantly with the fees costing a lot less than than what you paid maybe a fraction of a cent this is just a theory based on previous research .
litecoin was the first to implement lightning network technology as well as atomic swaps which has a similar technology but is used for instantly exchanging litecoin with other cryptocurrencies .
lightning network on the bitcoin blockchain could actually help litecoin and other bitcoin forked cryptocurrencies yes litecoin is a fork of bitcoin first of all litecoins atomic swap technology will enable litecoin to be spent anywhere bitcoin is accepted .
for example imagine if fiat currencies had atomic swap technology that would mean that a british person in new york would not have to exchange his pounds for dollars he would pay using his pounds gbp which would instantly convert to dollars usd and vice versa .
now heres an example using ltc/btc lets say you only own litecoins and come across a small cafe that only accepts bitcoin no problem you simply use atomic swaps to convert your litecoins to bitcoin and then you buy your coffee !
the lightning network will really unleash bitcoins potential as a currency and bitcoin will not just be used mainly as a store of value have you noticed that during this year 2017 a lot of big businesses such as microsoft and subway started to accept bitcoin as a payment method ?
lightning network will increase bitcoin adoption worldwide and this will in turn increase litecoin adoption which can only increase it 's demand and possibly raise it 's value .

while i was doing that my team said they had a 5th added to the match and he got the elo of the win .
we were 3-2 match point and won the round .
when i tried to match make it put me straight into searching for a game like i 'd never left a ranked 2 minutes previously .
so i have a project where we have two scripts simplified for the sake of this example
ava has the ability to match for test patters using the flag m so you can do ava serial verbose m testname ''
doing npm run test functional quick m testname '' works as you would expect but is there a way to do the same thing using the test functional script ?
i ca n't find a way to pass the flag down into the test functional quick script when calling from test functional short of using a process.env variable

the big one is that if kamara/ingram can get 296 yards combined they will be the first duo since the 1970 chicago bears to reach 3207 yards from scrimmage and will break the record for all purpose yards from a duo in a season
it sounds like a lot but i think one of the ulterior motives to kamara returning kicks last week was to bump up his all-purpose yardage and i expect to see him return kicks again this week to try and get to that mark kick off yardage doesnt count for this
drew brees can break the single season completion percentage record again lol this week as long as he maintains his current status of 71.9 .
he currently has a .3 advantage of sammy two sleeves '' bradford '' who took the record for him in 2016 .
if brees does break the record again he will hold 4 of the top 10 most accurate seasons of all time .
mike thomas needs 2 catches to simultaneously break jimmy graham 's single season catch record break 100 receptions on the year and become the first saints pass catcher to ever break 100 receptions .
with 10 receptions this week he would reach 200 catches for his career
mark ingram can tie the franchise single season rushing td mark with 1 td this week he would be in a 4 way tie with deuce mcallister george rogers and dalton hilliard .
mark has also caught a career high 54 balls this year and only needs 6 more receiving yards to top his personal best of 406
not a record or anything but ingram currently owns 3 of the top 13 longest runs in saints history and only he and deuce mcallister appear more than twice in the saints top 20 longest runs .
big nutz lutz is currently having the 2nd highest scoring season in franchise history and needs 13 points to supplant john kasay 's 2011 run as the highest in franchise history .
speaking of points if the team can score 12 points or more this week the team will more into 6th highest scoring team in franchise history .
this will give sean payton or sean payton coached teams 8 of the top 10 scoring offenses for the team
if the team can allow tampa to less than 5 points this week it will be the first time a sp coached team has given up less than 300 points overall for a season
ted ginn jr needs 6 catches and 36 yards to break his personal best in both areas 56 and 790
cameron jordan needs just .5 of a sack to tie his career high of 12.5 during a season .
as noted in another post marshon lattimore is currently tied for first place for interceptions in a rookie season and
2nd behind delvin breaux for pds in a season .
thanks for reading my wall of stat related trivia once again and let me know if i missed anything in the comments
with the likes of martial lukaku pogba rashford et al this is clearly a very talented squad full of young players and this youth is the issue for the youth brings with it a degree of inexperience and watching our often disorganised attempts at football is like watching a youth team play .
the team has no real structure or identity as if jose 's instructions amount to when zey have ze ball get in front of zem .
when we have ze ball i do n't know you guys know how to attack right ?
if not jus kick ze ball far away. in terms of his own comments on the team he seems very dissociated from anything tactically specific far removing himself from the actual method and style .
normally jose 's teams contain a handful of players who buy into his pragmatic philosophy providing a spine and platform for the rest of the team but our team does n't have that .
the attack minded exuberance does n't mesh with that pragmatism and there is nobody to lead the team on the pitch so that the players know what to do .
people might point at city and say they do n't have any leaders on the pitch but i 'd say they all buy so heavily into peps philosophy that they do n't need a leader on the pitch they already know what they 're supposed to be doing and are more than willing to do it .
spend more money and buy more players players who a buy into jose 's philosophy and crucially b who have the respect of their young but talented teammates to be a vocal player with a lot of success .
for all their talent ego seems like it could be an issue with this team and someone they are prepared to forsake their ego for is needed .
i was never roy keane 's biggest fan but he 'd be perfect in this team .
in terms of footballers currently playing around the world who fit the bill i honestly struggle to come up with names .
find a manager who has a style the players want to play for .
we have employed a dull pragmatism for far too long i 'd argue it started after champions league defeats to barce .
it worked under fergie because he inspired a degree of respect and loyalty .
the footballing world has moved on from pragmatism and we should too .
the two most eligible candidates both manage two of our biggest rivals although i 'd argue one of those is much more eligible than the other .
ideally you 'd want jose to evolve as a manager but he 'd need to get over himself first .
in normal difficulty 2 characters without lone wolf is very doable way harder for tactician but then again some crazy people beat tactician with 1 character without lw .

so this about the final nail in the coffin for me .
the question has been asked and answered so many tiems r/askphilosophy has put it up on their faq .
harris is racist specifically he 's an islamophobe who thinks that we ought to do terrible things to people with brown skin from predominantly muslim countries like nuclear bomb them torture them and racially profile them .
whether it 's objectionable to hold these views is a substantive moral debate which we wo n't go into here suffice to say that reasonable people often come down opposed to harris on these topics and if you disagree then we 've identified a way in which you think philosophers unnecessarily dislike harris .
this topic is also somewhat controversial because harris often denies that he is committed to these positions going so far as to edit blog posts he 's made https www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/4b9uat/harris_is_secretly_editing_his_blog_article without giving any indication that he has edited them to back away from these sorts of positions while at the same time continuing to espouse them elsewhere .
if you do n't think harris engages in this sort of subterfuge or you find it unobjectionable then again instead of hashing this whole thing out suffice it to say that you differ from philosophers on this point .
in general this is not the forum to make any sort of case against harris on these topics .
this would require surveying the available evidence a task complicated by harris 's subterfuge and providing substantive moral arguments against islamophobia .
these would both require more space and effort than is available here .
you are welcome to conduct your own investigation and form your own opinions .
this is just a place to note the reasons philosophers have for finding harris objectionable and his islamophobia is one main reason .
please do yourself a favour and actually try to see opposing arguments instead of going it must only be radical communist and lefty muslims calling sam harris an islamophobe ! ''
they call him annual gift man and he lives on the moon ! ''

okay well firstly there seem to be some variables you have but do n't use .
but perhaps these are to be used later in your code .
because you 're explicitly indexing header 0 it would work the same without the for line however this can be simplified a bit .
if we look at the content of the first header
so the text you want is inside the a tag contained within this h3 tag .
the h3 tag itself is the first one contained within the div so you can simplify that also
as for the id it 's available in a couple of places
extracting it from the a tag would require more work so it makes sense to get it from the div class '' ribbonize ''
the default attrs to match against is class meaning the find call here is the same as
if your getting spawn camped spawn in and do no move .
this will prolong your spawn protection and give you time to kill one or two .
if there are more than one or two then your team most likely sucks and your going to loose .

an observational study can not provide evidence of causation because it can not control variables .
that 's just wrong and i would encourage you to read judea pearl 's book on causality https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causality book which has a lot of detailed discussion on just that .
or look at the examples on wikipedia on natural experiments https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_experiment .
this kind of stuff is done all the time in economics but the basic statistical reasoning can be and is used in any field .
a fish simply can not climb a tree regardless of how great it is at being a fish .
i 'll refer you to wicaksono et al. the significance of pelvic fin flexibility for tree climbing fish '' http ase.tufts.edu/bugs/going 20on/papers/09.23.2016.pdf pdf .
i get what you mean but that 's not exactly uncommon on reddit .
the guy i replied to was implicitly saying if you do n't like it you can leave '' which is a logical fallacy .
i should n't have to explain why it 's not a valid counter-argument to simply tell the person to exit the system they are criticizing because it is all explained very well in the wiki .
these debates have left behind a huge mine field for us newcomers to navigate through made even more difficult due to the many loud voices out there trying to tell us their versions of the events their opinions are right .
most newcomers wont go through the mine field and discover the truth they will simply listen to the loudest voices .
unfortunately that 's exactly the tactic being used by ruger ver and co each noob stepping on a mine is money in their pockets and possibly a new member to their sheep army to lay new mines .
it 's the age old tactic of information asymmetry and keeping people stupid so they 're easier to control and fleece .
thanks for showing showing that is still possible to get through that minefield .

my point is that there are objective examples of why the script for this movie is good .
and if you do n't like what this movie does that 's fine .
but it does the things that it does quite well for the most part .
and again that is why critics like this movie as shown by general approval and average score general audiences like this movie as shown by cinemascore and box office receipts and a sizable segment of the star wars fandom likes it too .
i have very little patience for people who toss out vague complaints about the objective quality of the movie rather than complaints about subjective story or character beats .
i could do without the space horse stampede and chase sequence .
but given that similar pointless scenes exist in literally every other star wars movie i can not bring myself to believe that people are suddenly so critical .

600k after tax reinvested in index funds allows you to withdraw 2k/mo which is a decent living .
you can live like a king on this if you move to cheaper countries .

if this is the movie he wanted to make i do n't want him to make any more star wars movies ever again .
14 to and including 25 makes 12 days of christmas .
it 'll be announced but the stones will be switched for friend points
i do n't think it 's the movies as much as marketing they over emphasize the female thing and it annoys some people because they want a good character who happens to be female instead of a female character if that makes sense
it 's the same thing they say about peta which has convinced more people than almost any other organization on earth other than hinduism and buddism likely .
there are some cleverly concepted characters i 'm not sure why it makes it a comedic masterpiece .
i honestly did n't find the movie very funny .
it was clever but did n't make me laugh .
but i also hated the hangover and it seems everyone loved it so what do i know .
somebody who already has top-team experience allegri ancellotti simeone my top 3 candidates .
look at man u experimented with moyes and to a lesser extent with lvg and went through very bad seasons .
we should n't be looking at coaches at smaller clubs i 'm pretty sure no world class player would want to play under a howe or a sean dyche or whatever bullshit manager you come up with
you sure told all the sjw 's with that zinger !
it 's fine but it may not charge your switch as quickly .
the google charger has a max of 18w 9v 2a and the charger the switch comes with has a max of 39w 5v-15v 2.6a .
edit found a couple of souces claiming the switch will only pull 10w so likely no difference .
really working on bringing my chest up to par ca n't tell from the side i do n't think but it 's lagging behind for sure .
anyways any tweaks i should make to the pose ?
if you 're dead set on doing this no longer than 3 seconds and no dubstep/loud obnoxious music followed by a jarring change in volume commentary game etc .
i typically hate splash screens because 90 of them are done wrong .
i 'm guessing its possible at the mall on the day after christmas madness .
i 'm also going to guess so many people were willing to wait for the elevator because they had their hands full it 's a bit harder to go down the steps/escalator when your hands are full and you 're overloaded with bags .
robin quivers was ranked the highest on the npd scale which does n't quite register with me ... . but it 's dr drew so it must be true right ?
for the record i like dr drew and love adam carolla
i 'm liberal and i still live with my parents .
then again i 'm 18 so i probably get a pass .
i 'm not cured of this dis-ease known as alcoholism but i 'm doing well managing it .
one day at a time gets the badge counter moving the right way .
i would say the new insurgent models looks more simple me rebels syrian militias kurdish etc than isis fighters tbh .
at cu the majority of meche students with above 3.0 gpas used chegg based on my sampling of the 20 students i talked to about courses and things all my friends had above 3.0 so i ca n't say anything for those under .
it is possible that chegg is contagious and spread through my friends network though .
well based on other comments i 'm not alone in this situation .
drivers with the rls dont seem to work so install it then install the drivers manually from here https help.elgato.com/customer/portal/articles/2405414-elgato-gaming-hardware-drivers
install 3.20.33 download here http files.elgato.com/thcdownloads/egc/gamecapturesetup_3.20.31.1531_x64.msi and it will prob need a update to go from .31 to .33 after running it the first time .
and running this patch https edge.elgato.com/egc/windows/egcw/3.20/final/gamecapture_3.20_patch.exe should make game capture see the device .
they may even happen sooner/higher i guess time will tell .
look dude the nomenclature is not the problem here also dude chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature asian-american please .

why the fuck is this comment marked 'controversial ' ?
i went to disneyland on new years eve in 2011 and it was absolutely packed and terrifying .
they were turning people away but it was way too full
it 's changed since i took it last year but if you can get 27/37 algebra and 4/8 trig questions right 31/45 that will be enough to get into mat 114 .
when i took it it was 60 questions 50 algebra and 10 trig so i 'd imagine it would be easier now .
from what i read there was no exact cause but the ntsb noted that several maintencence checks on the pressurization system were done prior to the flight .
however they also note that the pilots failed to react in time and receive secondary oxygen through their masks indicating they may have been too slow to act .
i do n't understand the argument that you could replace sakura with any damsel and the story would n't change .
sakura was a pretty big motivator for naruto to keep going after sasuke .
you could make the replacement argument with naruto too .
you could replace him with any typical shonen protagonist like goku and the story would n't change .
towards the end of part 1 and all of shippuden naruto became about the eternal struggle between naruto and sasuke .
with that being said it feels wrong to call sakura a filler character .
just like it feels wrong to call kakashi a filler character .
some people just have poor metabolisms and a lifestyle/job that is n't very physical .
the result is somebody that 's healthy for the most part but overweight .
it 's not always about over eating there 's other factors to consider .
yeah they could go to the gym but it 's not for everyone .
nmm is end-of-life and they hired the dev of mod organizer to make its replacement .
i would recommend glove as it covers 3 of the 6 most important gk stats for e.g .
inb4 someoen says guys can do this too.. it 's not the same .
one tiny exception is when they are very young..literally just when their body has learned how this whole errection thing works but before the refractory period starts to occur .
sadly by the time i was 13 it had become impossible .
which is why when alex jones and cenk u clashed https youtu.be/1rswisvewnm ? t=58 i was amused as it was two bigots tearing into each other .
one of the dishes came in a wooden box with dry ice seeping out of it .

do n't we already have the equivalent of fast lanes with isps offering different bandwidth tiers and data caps ?
my current lineup is norma walter dantalion field flame strike ormus .
i eventually want to get the old enemy aura .
i wanted to ask whether it would be better for me to buy sigmund or corpsedemon as the tank from the snowman event .
and who would fit for the other factions third hero to replace dantalion .
got ta keep the mod rare for my future plat transaction you noob
he only had to fill time because they already spent 5 seconds showing the review and the result was obvious .
then he had 2 minutes to kill with bullshit while the refs did the same thing .
we have the technology that a 10 second review should n't take 2 minutes .
another ref or two should just be watching video the whole game and working with the on court refs to get the calls right .
he shows that the prime pro xhp35 has about 1/3 less output then armytek claims in their otf specs .
i also have owned 2 of these in the xhp35 warm variety and can confirm they are considerably lower output then they claim based on testing in my improvised light box compared to other lights .
they seem to be very prone to dying or malfunctioning for no reason even when they are well cared for .
because it says you wield it as a scimitar it is not finesseable without dervish dance .
i 'm not exactly sure what that 's means but i 'm pretty sure we 're on the same page .
and as for the pidgey you can blame the people i did customs for .
they 're the ones who wanted hp ground pidgey .
i did n't have a coin so i flipped a bottlecap on yours .
the quoted definition of nirvana by thich nhat hanh is that your working definition ?
by that standard i 've known many who have operated from that non stance .
many traditions thankfully have the custom or rule to refrain from boasting about attainments or even mentioning them .
as to others unless someone reporting here is enlightened themselves they will not be able to perceive the attainment of nirvana in another at best it will be a confirmation passed along by other masters .
how do you distinguish between a stage of awakening and nirvana ?
i felt the writers missed the fact that poe saved the entire rebellion by insisting that the dreadnought be taken down .
