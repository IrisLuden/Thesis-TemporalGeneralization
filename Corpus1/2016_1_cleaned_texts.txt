live in northeast and get about 2 weeks of snow a year .
so i 'm a pretty big nub when it comes to pvp .
i know pve like the back of my hand but have never really done pvp .
and i got a ps3 and i 've been doing a lot of invasions but i realize i really suck it pvp .
so i was wondering if anyone had some tips on how to git gud .
i get the customer code error and i have already called apple support and a senior advisor was not able to fix it for me .
however i realized that the smuuid generated by uuidgen in terminal is different every time i enter uuidgen on terminal after rebooting .
hey most of my friends are out at a hotel right now partying away but i 'm sitting at home tending to an injury .
anyone out there staying in for the new years that is up for a little chat ?
i 'm asian but you dont have to be !
ive got most of the regular chat apps if youd rather not use reddit .
tl dr is 375ug of lsd and .2g of mdma too much for someone with mild trip experience in a large social situation ?
i 've candy flipped twice before once with 200ug of lsd and .05g molly once with 100ug of lsd and .1g molly .
i 've also done 200ug of lsd by itself a couple times .
both candyflips were with close friends only 4-5 people my lsd trips have been the same or alone although i went to a big party 8 hours into a 100mg trip and felt decent socializing .
i 'm sort of introverted in that i do n't really like big groups of people i do n't know but i love hanging out with friends i do n't get the whole introvert need to be alone '' thing .
so tonight i 'm currently driving to a nearby college town with my usual trip buddies we have plenty of mdma and lsd 125mg tabs we are planning on both meandering campus by ourselves and attending a big party .
my plan originally was to take 3 tabs 375mg and .2g of mdma but i 'm worried it will be way too intense to be in a social setting .
update trip was great with 250ug and .3g of mdma .
picked up a smart car fortwo for an economical commuter car any practical mod suggestions to increase mileage ?
maybe a dumb question but i ca n't seem to land it reliably .
is there a certain frame it spikes on or a certain part of the hitbox ?
it 's so hit-or-miss for me and i feel like i can seal off matches a lot faster if i can land that better .
i 've hear about using the scroll wheel but i want to keep the wheel on weapon switch .
is there a way to keep both actions to the scroll wheel and then bind a separate key to toggle the functions ?
they did this last year so i 'm not sure it 's news but just a psa for everyone .
b/o 260 250 240 235 keys but im open to offers of any kind so hit me up
also interested in swapping for a mw ch karambit or a mw low float crimson web karambit
had an old c/o of 230 keys but the trade fell through .
i my self have 55/10mbps interwebs and this should be more than enough for good ping however my ping bar was usually red and other players would be yellow-red but seldom in the green .
i 'm not sure if i lagged bad to others but during this ib i would get impossible deaths at least from my perspective .
so to fix this i port forwarded ps4 and destiny ports and now my ping is always green and i do see red bars but that 's usually because others players are lagging bad .
now i do n't die as much from conspiracy theory across the room anymore d
guinea pigs are cute but they also poop a lot .
so besides the fact that my neighbors have been setting off fireworks for a few days now do they do fireworks downtown/on the bay or anywhere ?
this was my december submission for the monthly contests over at r/fantasywriters .
while i 'm not exactly happy with the latter half of it i 'm currently thinking of ways to expand it .
the lights flickered alive yet the boy strapped to the chair did n't flinch .
in his short existence he had experienced far too much to be afraid .
he was still alive but the light behind his eyes was dead .
luz leaned forward placing a foot on her chair .
my friend and i are gon na ask you some questions .
you comply and we can end this as soon as possible.
luz paused glancing at her first mate in the dim corner behind her .
reim stood statuesque arms crossed with a silent but intense scowl .
he was saving his words for after the interrogation no doubt .
turning back to shim luz 's smile straightened into a hard line .
but if you want to be stubborn we can do this all night.
the boy nodded silvery hair swaying like spiderwebs caught in a breeze .
if you are referring to my power of divination then yes .
and if we are to label ourselves by these blasphemous titles then i suppose that would make you a savant and your companion an empath correct ?
the ropes dug into his arms leaving red marks against pale skin .
luz had ordered them extra tight for extra precaution .
few knew if the legends held truth of a seer 's true power .
yours are cold and distant while his are warm and passionate .
his scowl had dissipated and made room for a small smile .
you 're as observant as we expected luz said nodding .
she removed her foot from the chair and placed her hands on her hips .
but as fast as his fa√ßade broke he repaired vacant expression on his face .
the duke while a renowned patron is also a man of ... peculiar preferences .
his contributions to the church have earned him considerable respect along with some notable immunities .
i am not his first doxy but my divination is far too valuable for him to discard of me like my predecessors .
i 've found myself always at his side as a result.
luz closed her eyes taking in all the information .
a spark of joy yet also disgust sparked in her .
she chose to focus on the former if only for now .
when she opened her eyes she was met with shim glancing downwards .
she could n't tell if he was avoiding her gaze or deep in thought .
then again she did n't care to find out .
then surely you 're the reason for his recent ascension amongst the nobles ?
you could steer him in the right direction during important decisions by predicting the different outcomes.
my divination is limited like all powers the boy said .
for every bit of the future i see it eats away at my memories .
you sacrifice feeling for your calculating nature and your companion becomes less of an erudite to better assess one 's emotions .
i have already lost so much that taking any more memories could prove detrimental to my wellbeing .
if i am not careful i could enter a comatose-like state or lose my sanity.
so you 're useless as a seer then ? luz asked frowning as she felt all her hopes dashed at once .
the boy only attempted to shrug again staring straight ahead .
the gods have blessed me with involuntary visions before free from me having to expend my own memories .
i have only experienced them when my life seems to be threatened .
i must admit i feared you at first but now i know you have no intentions of harming me. shim smiled his lips quivering like the act was rare .
you want to know the location of the vault of kings.
excitement returned shooting up luz 's arms like electricity .
even her clarity could n't subdue the emotions she had bottled up so long ago .
the duke had asked me the same question countless times .
each time i gave him the same answer as all other seers have given for the past twenty years.
the boy shuffled in his seat testing the rope 's strength again .
once he figured he would n't escape he sighed .
if my suspicions are correct the vault of kings lies deep in the eye of a black hole.
luz ran a hand across the translucent screen absorbing the information as it popped up .
every star nebula planet and more filled out the expansive map in her mind as the ship flew across space at an undetermined pace .
too fast to comprehend but too slow for luz 's hungry mind .
for the last time i 'm completely sure reim sighed .
he lay on the plush couch fingering the necklace hanging from his neck .
each time it caught the light of the nearby lamp it sprayed golden rays along the room 's walls .
one pierced luz 's screen obscuring a sliver of the voltaric galaxy as she attempted to memorize it .
after three separate chidings the empath had n't complied to her simple request .
the man stopped turning his necklace and looked at her expectantly with his signature smirk .
by the looks of it he expected to be reprimanded .
i 'm curious how an exorbitant amount of wealth could have been hidden away in a place that would kill any normal man she said .
but i would hardly say the man who owned the universe 's greatest fortune was anything normal. the empath looked luz up and down holding in a snicker .
i 'd think you 've been on this ship long enough to know flattery is worthless with me.
ever heard of them ? reim said shaking his head .
does the pitiful excuse for one in front of me count ?
the empath clutched his chest falling backwards on the couch with a muted plop .
his other arm shielded his eyes as a defeated sigh left his lips .
i 'm still not convinced by what the seer said .
and do you also not trust the best empath this side of the flian allegiance ?
i do n't make mistakes when reading someone 's emotions .
and besides that boy 's affiliated with the church .
those are the most honest bunch i 've ever had the misfortune of meeting.
because the duke of thaspia is a shining example of their sound morals right ? luz asked .
reim opened his mouth to counteract but stopped halfway .
not because she did n't know what to say but how to say it .
she sat on the arm of the couch by reim picking the correct words carefully before speaking .
and here i thought i 'd never see the day logic 's mistress spouting superstition like fact .
by the gods you sound like the kooks waiting for the universe to suddenly collapse .
luz turned her head trying to controlling to the burning sensation behind her cheeks .
it 's only a theory not my actual opinion .
after all he had no issue discerning our powers in little time .
i think he 's hiding more than he 's willing to admit.
and this includes the true location of the vault ?
it sounds far more logical than what he told us before.
she could count on one hand the amount of times his quips were well thought out .
but if he is withholding the truth from us how do you plan on getting it from him ?
we 'll first start with making sure his story remains consistent .
in the case it does then we 'll move to coercion .
if that does n't work then perhaps torture would be‚Äì
you ca n't tell me you 're actually considering torturing that kid all on the assumption that he 's lying to us.
i have no intentions of doing so without heavy consideration though .
i have to find the vault before the duke ‚Äì or any noble that is ‚Äì finds it.
and you 're really willing to go that far just for a fortune ?
do n't make me sound like the villain luz said shooting daggers at him .
the empath rose from the couch pacing back and forth .
he mumbled under his breath occasionally casting a disapproving look on luz .
she could n't remember the last time he had been so quick to show his anger without restraint .
at least he had never done so towards her .
you know reim said pointing a finger at her for the smartest person i know you can be really stupid sometimes .
i usually give you the benefit of the doubt because you 're the brains but not this time .
i wo n't let you pretend to be the heartless monster you 're not to fulfill some crazy quest for redemption .
if you want to scour the universe to restore your father 's name so be it .
but do n't think i 'll stand by as innocent blood is spilled.
i never intended to spill innocent blood but if it 's the fastest way then it will be done .
i 've never touted heartlessness on my sleeve but do n't mistake me as a saint .
i ca n't afford to lose what my father fought so hard to keep from the corrupt.
green light wrapped and bent around him molding a black silhouette against the soft touch of its glow .
you hardly fit the bill to be pirate he said disapproval deep in his voice .
i felt your emotions when shim told us about the duke .
you 're not the first captain i 've sworn allegiance under and i can tell you that the other men i 've worked with would n't have batted an eyelash .
and to no one 's surprise they 're all dead .
luz opened her mouth to retort but stopped with a violent shiver roared through her body .
pricks of ice ran down across her skin causing her to inhale sharply .
she turned around half expecting to find a specter looming over her shoulder .
instead two pale purple eyes watched her from the darkness .
shim ? she whispered like a child learning their first swear .
his face was as stagnant as ever but his curious eyes scanned the room with intrigue .
his chaffed and bloody wrists hinted at a far greater story .
i apologize for interrupting shim said with a slight bow .
when he noticed the two staring at his wrists he clasped his hands behind his back before clearing his throat .
but i have urgent news that could n't wait for your return.
her shoes clicked echoing off the walls in the still air .
before shim could continue a boom shattered the silence .
both luz and reim lost their balance toppling to the floor as the ship careened to one side .
the seer however managed to stay afoot with little more than a thoughtless shuffle .
once the din ceased he tilted his head upwards with a frown .
hmm i suppose i moved with too little haste .
tapping his chin shim lowered his gaze onto her .
there is a ring of stars surrounding clasped hands emblazoned on it sides.
the captain bit the inside of her cheek until the subtle taste of blood danced across her tongue .
you should go up to the starboard before they launch another volley on your cruiser .
by the interior dimensions i am assuming it can not withstand a large assault.
she turned back to reim who had mustered the strength to bring himself off the ground too .
however he did little to hide how much the first few shocks had shaken him .
i need you to watch our esteemed guest here .
the first mate nodded his fingers grasping at the sole earring hanging from his left ear .
luz returned her gaze on the boy in front of her .
under any other circumstance she would have tied him up in the darkest of cells .
however she had a sneaking suspicion he would still find a way out .
do n't do anything suspicious she said staring him down .
if you try to escape i will personally take upon myself to hunt you down.
i do not have desire to die in your company .
after giving the boy a quick scan luz made a dash for her personal elevator .
she rarely needed it on the account that attacks were almost nonexistent .
so far it had done little more than collect dust .
but in that moment she was thankful for it .
each second seemed to stretch until its limit enough to drive even the sanest man mad .
but luz held on if only until she reached the starboard .
its static hum was interrupted by two voices one annoyed while the other monotone .
please allow me to use it for only this instance.
ah captain luz ? the voice was definitely that of shim .
i apologize for the inconvenience but i have had a revelation .
i believe i know who the imperial ship belongs to.
the elevator jerked as it reached its stop but she paid it little heed .
ah well you see ... the intercom crackled again distorting the boy 's words .
luz banged her fist against the device but it did little to help .
on the other side was a man in a rich navy suit almost like a blob in space himself .
two armed soldiers flanked him wearing armor in a similar style to the giant ship floating above .
meanwhile luz 's ship was engulfed in its enormous shadow .
the suited man smiled and then gave a sharp bow .
a sharp nose hooked over a bushy mustache like a rocky protrusion extending from a mountain cliff .
my you 're not what i expected he said with a faint accent .
but i suppose the first rule when dealing with pirates is to not make assumptions .
he was familiar but she could n't place where .
i admire that in a person. when luz did n't respond he continued by placing a gloved hand on his chest .
however you may address me by my formal title ‚Äì his royal duke of the thaspia .
if my sources are to be trusted i believe you are in possession of something of mine.
the man raised an eyebrow twisting his mustache between his thumb and index finger .
i hope you are aware that it is unbecoming of a lady to lie. his expression soured .
the duke stepped forward his willowy posture snapping into that of an oak 's girth .
his suit wrapped around his growing muscles until they had no more room fabric and seams on the edge of bursting .
give me shim and maybe i wo n't blow this ship into a cloud of debris the duke said his voice dipping an octave lower .
it paced to a beat of an emotion she had long forgotten .
most of the crew had made their way to the deck .
few did n't seem concerned by the man 's words .
if they did n't they were as good as insane .
well the duke demanded his hulking frame towering over luz .
are you going to give back what you stole ?
dozens of faces watched her taut with fear and uncertainty .
while none were new to sailing the same could be same for those experienced with political enemies .
another overzealous pirate ship trying to make a name for itself was no problem .
but when dealing with a man like the duke the situation was destined to end in a loss .
she funneled her fears deep away in her psyche leaving nothing left but pure logic .
the perks of being a muse in stressful situations meant not having to worry about intimidation 's phantom hand swaying one 's decisions .
do you know who i am ? she asked standing taller .
hair as black as the space eyes as cold as night .
that same smirk that drove the other nobles raving mad .
it 's been years since i 've see it .
and that means i am the true heir to the vault of kings .
with your seer i 'm going to find it and end everyone 's search.
the duke bellowed a laugh strong enough to shake the dome above .
a few of the crewmates flinched glaring up with hesitation as if they expected the whole complex to crumble down .
i see you 've inherited his ambition along with his looks too the duke said .
i must admit i have little patient for your kind .
your father hid away the secret to turning the tides of this war .
it should be put in the hands of a man with skills one who knows how to bring together whatever will be left of this needless conflict.
i suppose we 'll just have to see who comes across the vault first .
furrowing his brow the duke pivoted sharply the sound of his shoes scraping against the metal floor echoing for seconds afterwards .
the soldiers flanked at his side followed holding their guns high for anyone who dared to attempt a surprise attack .
i will not let some insolent child vex me so the duke said waving a dismissive hand .
shim was growing far too dull for me as of late anyway.
a soft blue light flashed around him and his men as his teleporter readied .
before he disappeared however the duke turned back to face luz once more .
he waved slowly as his body faded away but the words remained .
the alarms screamed like a dying beast in agony .
cursing luz ran to the steering wheel at the helm of the ship .
luz pushed past anyone standing in the narrow corridor to the wheel .
it spun fast enough that the pegs to blurred but she caught when her hands reached out .
looking at the monitor she tried to correct the ship 's direction but it did n't respond .
it only jerked from one side to the next with little warning wailing and flashing lights .
turning back she grabbed the first person she saw by the arm .
mouth agape the man nodded and then sped off .
meanwhile luz continued to wrestle the ship into submission .
the sound of footsteps approached behind but she did n't turn to face them .
what happened ? reim asked his words short and choppy .
luz grunted as the wheel pushed her in an unexpected direction again .
he is not a man who takes rejection well shim said appearing at her side .
unlike everyone else he did n't seem as frightened by the ship plummeting deeper into space .
however i must applaud your courageousness regardless of how reckless of a plan it was .
you may want to hold on to that thanks .
unless i can get control of this we 're either going to run through an asteroid belt or stray too close to a star.
would it be of any use to let you know of the other vision i 've been given ?
the captain stopped struggling with the wheel her full attention on the boy .
i 'm afraid i can not answer that with security shim said .
i saw the ship veering towards a black hole not far from here .
or it could just be another way we die reim chimed .
i am unclear of the outcome that is for certain .
however i hope that you do trust me now that you see i have no allegiance to the duke anymore.
a quick glance at the map showed the black hole shim referred to .
it was small but close enough for her to drift towards with the right handling .
the ultimate question was if she really wanted to take the risk .
taking a deep breath she grabbed the wheel and pushed it towards their new destination .
the ship shook yet somehow she kept it on track .
i 'm looking for a the 1975 band theme for my xbox one dashboard it 's the latest layout which came with an update a while back not a clue what nxoe means .
i 've been seeing read/write tests that show the speed differences between ssds and m.2 and i 'm curious if there is any real world difference in boot times between the two .
are there any tests/videos/benchmarks that show the difference in boot-up time between windows 10 on a ssd or on a m.2 ?
i 'm 16 years old not sexually active but planning to be and was wondering at what age did you first go to a gynecologist ?

my question is around dual role keys and specifically action_mods_tap_key .
i have this applied so that an alpha key gives say an 'a ' on tap and then alt on press .
the trouble is that this seems to accidentally trigger as the mod key all the time .
i had a look around and a patch for this is suggested here https github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/issues/215 but i 'm not sure how i would apply it .
i 'm trying to get craftsman 's specs but i 'm having trouble doing triplets with randoms .
none of the weapons in it are the ones i regularly use .
i can sorta do horn but i need more practice .
anyway if anyone wants to give me a hand trying to knock this one out i 'd really appreciate it .
message me so we can work out a time to meet up .
mine is to overcome writers block and get some substantial work on some of the screenplays i 'm writing .

hi i 'd like to make a wishlist of some pieces that will never go out of style .
so as the title said i wish get away from consoles .
though after weeks of research i have come across my two choices .
i have been suggested these 2 laptops quite frequently and i am wondering which one i should choose .
i 've been told that pretty much the only difference between the two is that the first has a 970m 6gb and the second has a 960m 4gb i will hook it up to my tv and play through my sound system so screen res and speaker quality are n't that much of a concern .
is it really worth the extra money to upgrade to the other ?
i would like to play on high settings but how much would the difference effect it ?
was going to try running a clapton 1.2 ohm on my wife 's vv/vw mod .
is this feasible or should i just stick to regular kanthal ?
i know this thread http www.coh2.org/topic/36347/cruzz-s-the-more-you-know states some but one of my friends recently told me that kv-1 bulletins also apply to kv-8 and t-34/76 bulletins also apply to t-34/85 so i 'm wondering is there a full list of all bulletins that affect more than one unit ?
i guess i 've been very slowly collecting game boys since i was a kid .
but i 've been doing some reading lately and there are a couple of mods i 'd like to try out .
i 've fixed my share of laptops built loads of pcs etc. but my soldering skills are almost nonexistent .
which of these would be the easiest for a modding novice ?
not traded in about 6 months just wondering the price screen http imgur.com/d5gvj2n

i could pretty much solo with this in difficulty level .
the machine sniper rifle is now available therefore it is time to do some testing .

i have ksprc installed and i was trying to get the ksprc config for opm to have the mod pack match stock but i ca n't seem to get it to work .
is this because the cloud config is n't updated for the new ksprc ?
i know it is n't rwby related whatsoever but i hope the mods can make an exception for this .
i have a few things i 'd like to share along with my own resolutions .
first off a big thanks for everyone for making an awesome community to be a part of .
i 've never felt so welcomed and glad to actually want to participate in conversations here even though i do n't actually converse with many here personally .
i could n't ask for a better group of people to nerd out with than everyone here .
now i have two resolutions for 2016 one that leads into another .
my first is i 'd like to know more animators 2d or 3d .
i 've never actually had friends who i could openly talk with about animation aside from dillon but he 's busy with rwby .
so i 'd be nice to talk with more people who share my same hobby/dream of being a 3d animator 2d is equally as cool .
i find more inspiration from bouncing off ideas from other people while working but i have n't been able to do that regularly .
my second is simply to get better at 3d animation .
kinda underwhelming to some but i 've always found myself becoming jealous of sorts when i see someone 's animations get a lot of attention especially if said comments tell the creator that they should be hired by rooster teeth .
that 's my dream and the thought of others getting there before me makes me think it 'll only get harder and harder to get there myself .
so i 'm hoping that if i actually get better and actually get my work finished and out there maybe i 'll be that one step closer to working there as well .
it 's a hard dream to have or even saying out loud like this since i 'm sure hundreds of people have the exact same dream i do but ... it 's something i 've been passionately working towards since monty 's passing .
and even though jealousy does pop up hopefully i 'm able to turn that into a tool of motivation .
i do n't personally need motivation to want to work but maybe using it to work faster would be good .
i know people do n't really know me all that well so spewing these thoughts out at you guys might seem a little off '' but i suppose that just emphasizes my comfort in this community .
so instead of making this about me i 'd like to hear what you all have as your own new year 's resolutions .
now i just need to get the hebridean thoughtcrime ...
how long did it take the rest of you to get your most-desired ships ?
and i am getting around 10-20fps on everything set to medium and ground and sky details turned off .
the only thing i have set up high is the resolution scale .
i 'm pretty sure t3 sab and def is still pretty solid but i 've got basically no keys left .
in the season 1 finale livia tells arty that tony set arty 's restaurant on fire .
is anyone else having trouble signing into their draft kings account ?
i 've got some solid stuff going right now and is keeps saying they are having trouble getting me logged in ? ! ?
as of now the titans mariota and browns manziel are 3-12 .
when they lose next week they will have the 1st and 2nd overall pick .

honestly did not know and i did n't really see anyone following me either i pulled you over for speeding . ''
chp officer asks if i knew the speed limit i reply yes the speed limit is 45mph '' because i assumed the violation was in the area he just pulled me over in .
well yes the speed limit here is 45mph but you were speeding down the road in a different speed zone . ''
on this road in a 3 mile stretch the speed changes from 55 to 50 to 45 as you get closer to the work town '' .
the officer claims that he saw me '' going 73mph in the 50mph zone then immediately says that he clocked me with his radar going 53mph .
officer claimed that my tags were expired as well said they were 2014 and that 's also a reason he pulled me over explanation coming .
the officer asks if i have any warrants or felonies before even asking for my license and insurance .
i hand over my license and registration after he asks for it .
the officer asks me what i 'm doing driving from live in town '' to work town '' at 5am .
he asks for my current address and writes it down on some paper he pulls out i used to live in the work town '' so my license has my old address even though i moved 2 years ago .
he asks are you sure your car is registered ? ''
i found it odd that he asks me this again as if i 'm lying to him and i say yes ! ''
he then explains that i had 2014 tags showing but i know im registered until the end of 2015 .
officer comes back after a few minutes with the ticket already written out .
explains he 's giving me a ticket for speeding .
in my head i 'm like wtf you 're seriously writing me a ticket for 3mph above 50 at 5am and there 's no traffic ? ''
just listen to him explain that i will get something in the mail .
he asks for my signature and we 're on our way .
as soon as i get to my desk at work i bust out the ticket to look at it in better lighting .
officer wrote that i was going 60mph in a 50mph ! !
he also writes the location of the violation which is near the small creek the road goes over before getting into the work town . ''
the creek is about 3 miles/4 minutes back up the road from where i was pulled over i drive this road twice a day 5 days a week so i 've been keeping track of the time and distances of all the locations .
also ... this location of the violation is approximately 15 seconds at 50mph or 1/5 of a mile after the speed zone changes from the 55mph zone to 50mph zone .
there 's a radar device in-ground at this speed change '' location that alerts you of your speed .
the officer never mentioned the radar device at all .
if i was speeding even if i was going 73mph i would expect him to pull me over immediately .
i 've seen many times people pulled over in this 3 mile stretch so it is something that could have been done so it was weird for him to wait 3-4 minutes to turn on his lights .
fast forward to november i receive the paperwork in the mail to pay 269 or to plead not guilty .
i notice that the date of the violation is incorrect as well now .
it 's showing the violation for the thursday before the incident .
i filled out that i am pleading not guilty and sent the paperwork back on 11/19 .
finally on 12/16 i receive a reply saying i have court on 1/4/16 less than 3 weeks notice .
‚Ä¢ is it legal or a common action for the an officer to change the speed of the violation even though he verbal said he clocked me going 53mph and not mention to me that he changed it on the ticket before i signed it ?
‚Ä¢ the officer was subpoenaed so if he shows up and testifies that he saw me going 73mph '' can i counter with saying something along the lines it 's not what you know it 's what 's you can prove and you were attempting to prove to me that i was going 53mph with a radar device ? ''
‚Ä¢ i did n't ask during the stop if i can see the radar which maybe i should have but is that something i can bring up in court ?
‚Ä¢ can i ask to see when the radar device was last calibrated in regards to the traffic stop date to ensure it 's accuracy for when it was used on me ?
‚Ä¢ if i point out to the judge the discrepancy of both the increase of speed i was ticketed for and the incorrect date of the violation would that have any legal advantage to me ?
‚Ä¢ as for the distance/time that it took the officer to pull me over again 3-4 minutes/3 miles is there some kind of time or distant limit that the officer has to pull me over in ?
‚Ä¢ i can get a print out of my punch in at work for that thursday proving i was already at work .
would that allow for the charge to be dropped or will the judge allow for the trial to continue because i 'm attempting to correct the date of the violation ?
is the court supposed to allow a period of time to make sure i can make the court date or is there no minimum amount of time given ?
i feel 3 weeks is very little notice to allow for me to get the time off from work .
thank you in advance for any advice help you can provide .
i 'm writing everyone back as quickly as possible .
while driving home from kayak point at about 5:15pm i found an older chocolate lab 60lbs in the road near the intersection of 135th pl nw and marine drive .
i checked with some of the neighbors in the area that were home and nobody recognized the dog .
since it was new years eve the shelters were closed one of the neighbors in the area offered to take the dog for the night in case someone came looking and then call a vet in the morning to see if the dog was microchipped .
here are three photos we able to take of the dog
if you know who this dog might belong to let me know and we can try to put them in touch with the neighbor that took the dog in .
i know it 's hard believe me but you will get through it .
your life is much more than just the fleeting shallow pond of the present it 's a vast ocean of experiences and relationships you have n't even experienced yet .
no matter how stormy that ocean may be storms never last .
look past the darkness and on into the warm light of the future .
i know it 's a herculean task to try and keep yourself heading forwards and ignore the rain and hail of sadness but i know it will end soon .
if you are alone tonight/today i know it may not help much but i and probably many others love and appreciate you unconditionally .
i hope your new year is full of clear skies and sunshine .
but they got anthrax mixed up with tampax and poisoned the wrong cunt
for about five years now this photo http lowres-picturecabinet.com.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/43/main/54/133096.jpg of a cannon aboard the ss great eastern has intrigued me .
now i understand that back in the day civilian vessels had some artillery pieces to defend against piracy but the ss great eastern was launched in 1858 .
this is at least 150 years after the decline of piracy in the atlantic .
so what purpose would mounting such a cannon aboard an ocean liner serve ?
it 's definitely not a cannon used for a gun salute as it 's too big .
here 's to another year of fucking greatness from these amazing people .
still not quite 2016 where i am but whatever !
thanks for the nomination for consistent gifter and happy new year !
looking forward to another year of living and giving .

good luck and best regards for the new year !
more often than not i get more deaths than kills .
my k/d usually hovers somewhere in the .75 range despite being rank 50 and having almost 5000 kills .
i can count the times i 've been in the top 5 players of the game on one hand using 2 fingers .
even when i get the drop on an enemy i sometimes die to them .
i can usually hit an enemy but i can never consistently get headshots .
without the usual git gud '' comments believe me i 've tried can anyone give some advice to help me not be a goddamn embarrassment ?
i have almost everything unlocked and upgraded card-wise and i have every blaster unlocked .
ive tried them all extensively but i just cant figure out which one would complement my poor aim the best for minimal fristration .
i 've played for over 90 hours and i do n't seem to be getting any better .
i love star wars and i genuinely enjoy the core gameplay but it just seems like everyone is better than me in almost every way .
edit i want to thank everyone for the words of encouragement and advice .
a few changes i 've made based on your responses that have helped me significantly are ...
a few friends had told me that it needs to be fairly high so that you can turn around quickly if someone sneaks up on you but its not worth it .
i set the sensitivity down to 20 and i 've been doing much better .
i 've also been making a conscious effort to finesse the stick so i 'm not jerking it around or always pushing it all the way in one direction .
i think might have been contributing to a lot of my problems .
also i 've tried picking a blaster the e-11 and sticking with it .
i wish the zoom was a little stronger though like the ee-3 .
i love that blaster but i 'm shit with it ...
i 've been using the jetpack a lot too .
it 's gotten me out of some bad situations and into some good ones .
just aim at their feet and away they go .
this has happened to me via pc dark souls on steam and it 's made me quit the game entirely
i got this friend of my to play the game so i wanted to share my steam library with him since he did n't have the money to buy it .
i passed him on my steam password changed and he downloaded the game and made sharing available on his computer .
he finished downloading it exit my account tried opening the game and found dsfix had crashed it tipical .
the issue is as soon as i tried opening the game myself every single one of my save files had been deleted and replaced by a different one he had made several months ago in a different computer with his own account .
i ca n't see this making even the slightest of sense and i honestly do n't expect anything since i probably ca n't fix it but how is this even possible ?

i was wondering what the best bits/shows were of the first year on sirius 2006 .
i have just acquired the 2006 archive and want to hit the highlights on my new years break before i return to college then i can just listen to them all commuting to class .
it rarely ever happened to me in the first game but now it 's like you ca n't win the fight if you and the boss have n't died at the same time in at least one fight .
i 've been in wellington for 7 months now and i really want to meet new people but i 'm generally a nervous wreck when it comes to those meetup group things .
could anyone suggest some sort of activity type thing ?
i know this sounds very vague but i 'd love to find a new hobby and make some friends .
if it helps i have a law degree love cats and play guitar .

a reasonable fee and private hire service would work well do you think ?
or even smuggling fugitives would be a thing possible right ?

i 've tried on multiple machines in japan and in socal .
both times game sounds does not come through i tried to adjust the volume but to no avail .
i am new to sdvx so it just might be me being a noob but can anyone tell me if there is a certain requirement for headphones for sdvx and other bemani games .
i met this girl about a year and a half ago .
we got introduced by a mutual friend of ours and i guess we just kind of connected .
for the first couple of months while we started dating i swear it was the best honeymoon phase ever .
i got to know her so well and i really fell for her .
i love her so much and i really enjoy the time we spend together .
as time goes on by the honeymoon phase just kind of goes away i guess and that 's when we started to have a bit of trouble .
this is my first real relationship so i was really scared during our first fights because i did n't know how to handle them .
i went with my gut most of the time and rarely asked for any advice because i do n't really talk to much about my personal life .
except right now i guess so most of the fights we had were normal relationship milestones .
i love the way we work together because we are both very independent .
i can say for certain that i am not a jealous guy .
when we first started dating she told me that before me she had been going out with a lot of guys but that she was done with that .
i really do n't see any point in dwelling with the past of people so i told her that i really did n't care for that .
she told me that she still keeps contact with some of the guys she dated and asked if that was ok and i said sure .
i can go out with my friends anytime i want and she is fine with it as long as i see her at least one day a week which i am really fine with .
and she does the same and everything just kind of works .
during month 8 to 9 we had a real rough patch .
it was really hard because when she fights she used to talk really mean to me .
she would say things like fuck you '' this is your typical shit '' and stuff like that .
after this month ended i had enough so by the end i called her to break up .
while we were talking on the phone she started crying a lot and asked me why i was breaking up with her .
i went ahead and told her that i was just tired of fighting everyday and that i hated the way she talked to me when she was mad .
after about 3 hours talking we decided to see each other the next day to really talk things true .
the next day we started talking about everything and we decided to set some rules to the way we fight .
and i was really happy that we could talk about this .
this very day we had another fight regarding a friend of mine .
she told me she was jealous of her but that she did n't want to say anything because she thought she was being stupid and because she felt that because i was never jealous of her friends that she was n't allowed to tell me anything .
i told her that she had every right to tell me if something was making her uncomfortable and that i was going to stop talking to this friend .
do n't get me wrong her jealousy was well justified .
this friend '' i had started to tell every one that she had feelings for me and stuff so cutting communication was probably a good idea anyway .
so after this big fight where we almost broke up we kind of got back to normal .
it was weird at first and she told me it was because i had actually broken up with her and that it hurt her a little .
but after all we kind of worked through everything .
the rules we set have worked a lot and she has n't used bad language when we fight and neither have i .
the thing is that after all of this i think i just got tired .
i know that i love her a lot and that she is really great but sometimes i just want to break up .
i think maybe just posting this is helping me think things through .
tl dr me and my girlfriend of one year almost broke up on month 9 and even though we got through that i still feel like breaking up .
i still feel that i love her a lot to .
hey guys i need some valuable advice from here as i 'm thinking of getting an mx-5 but none of my friends own a two-seater as their daily driver .
i 'm single and there 's only me and my mom at home so for family occasions it 'll just be me driving her around .
also if i start dating it will just be me and my gf .
for work i only envision driving 1 colleague for meetings .
i 'm just thinking at the age of 30 and being unmarried this is the last years of my life i would get to own a two-seater .
i do n't imagine being wealthy enough to own a boxter on top of a family car in future .
some of my friends have been telling me it 's a stupid idea due to the fuel consumption and the insurance and also that i wo n't be able to drive my mom and my gf or a bunch of friends .
their recommendation is for a lancer or civic maybe an old impreza .
edit wow guys thanks for all the replies i 've read every single comment and upvoted even the negative ones .
i was seriously so stressed about this decision but it seems clear as day to me now .
i remember reading a notice recently that skillup monsters like chasers and bowl demons wo n't need to be evolved to be used for skillups .
does anyone know when that 's coming to na ?
i have a bunch of those taking up space in my box .
so basically an iwidget or any widget where i can scroll through days with arrows and see events for the day .
i just want to wish ya 'll a happy new year .
thanks for being awesome not just here but also on the discord channel .
much love from germany to where you guys live !
i mean it 's a multiplayer game after all they should sustain the activities of this game .
take for instance destiny i think its almost 2 years old and they keep on giving updates .
this is in a conversation at a new years party .
should i tell the guy or is it none of my business ?
for a week i kept thinking to myself i should put a picture on reddit inviting a woman in my city to celebrate the new year with me .
has anyone tried charging their ipad pro with any 3rd party usb-c to lightning cable and any usb-c charger apple or 3rd party .

all the best for 2016 and i hope your enemies perished in 2015 if not then buy them a beer who knows they might actually get friendly
6 mr 4 strength and 9 av seems extremely strong compared to a drawback of 1 ag .
i get that they have poor ball management but considering how hard skinks are to hit it 's near-impossible to get to the skinks when there 's a line of 4 strength linemen between you and them .

so yeah looks are n't everything and women are placed on very harsh standards when it comes to beauty but if i 'm allowed to be shallow for a moment ...
are any of you offended when ugly people take interest in you ?
i ask this because i ca n't see myself as anything above a 4/10 and i do n't want to make girls feel horrible about themselves when i hit on them .
also the only people i seem to attract are of similar physical 'meh'-ness imo so idk
once upon a time i needed hr akantor parts .
i join a multiplayer room to make things a bit faster .
the first room i join has 2 hr7s in it .
so we go into the quest and everything is fine .
i brought my gs set and cera cymmetry so i figure it 'd be pretty fast .
fought for a good five minutes or so no carts so far everything is looking good .
until all of the sudden akantor turns around and hits all three of us with his armor melting bite at once .
we all fly into the air and onto the ground and as we get up his tail swipe kills all of us and the quest is failed .
as for me i want all of my top5 's cards to be at least r31
today i wanted to farm my garuga gq but saw that the high rank questatrix had some new advanced quest .
i 'm like what the heck i am g3 i can handle some puny high rank monsters '' so i picked the quest with fatalis fade to black or what .
i 've never fought the monster before or visited this castle schrade place so i thought it would be fun to see what they are like .
this purple fucknugget i thought it was supposed to be black hits hard as fuck .
i thought i was fighting a high rank monster not a fucking g rank elder dragon .
sure you can avoid most of the attacks if you are at its hindlegs but the asshole 's dalamadur length tail will knock you off your feet eventually and then this shitbiscuit will suddenly teleport in front of you and blow you to kingdom come .
i wish i could strangle it with its own thin tail before hanging it on one of those fucking towers and watch it trash around helplessly as it suffocates .
i am sure i broke everything on this piece of shit so when i think about the rewards i would 've recieved if i killed it i just rage harder .
hi all i do have a huge problem ... it has been almost a week .
everytime i give wifi pw ping goes up 150 especially 300 when they open a video .
it was n't like this before and now i have to change pw everynight to play normally .
so its getting bigger problem and they criticize for why .
when im alone its 80 which is okay but as soon as i give it never goes to below 120 .
our family has had a tradition of gathering in the living room every january 1 cranking the tv volume up to an unhealthy level and watching the vienna new year 's concert for quite a few years now .
so i 'm asking nicely what should i do with my 2.5 million worth of players ?
how to start selling those players and how the hutrep works ?
my first thought was to sell them player by player in ebay but i have n't sold anything internationally there yet .
i 'm 37 years old and veteran auction house seller here in finland website called huuto.net but the 100 positive rep from years of selling items there does n't really help me with this dilemma .
i have seven years old xbox live account with 60k gamerscore and over 200 follwers there so i 'm really not trying to pull any scam here .
i can post a list of players here without selling prices and maybe you guys can help me out trying to figure out the best way of selling them ?
those are the ones i remember without checking and i might have something else too but nothing special besides those cards .
i had an a1200 which i loved but left behind when i went to university .
i ended up buying a laptop for my studies my first windows computer running xp .
i thought it was an ok os but my love of computers slowly died over the years i had no love for windows .
7 years later no-one wanted vista and xp had aged badly .
my senior at work introduced me to ubuntu 9.04 and a whole wave of nostalgia flooded back the first time i booted it up .
i bought a linux format magazine to accompany my new-found enchantment and almost cried when i saw a piece by nick veitch previous editor of amiga format .
to this day i look back with resentment on my 7 years with windows feels like looking back on an abusive relationship but maybe it was meant to have happened like that !
using ubuntu-mate 14.04 as my only os to this day on a thinkpad have a rekindled fascination for computers and oss and even got a subscription to linux voice https www.linuxvoice.com for christmas !
so what journeys have you taken since the last days of amiga ?
i am looking to build this cabinet http www.diynetwork.com/how-to/skills-and-know-how/carpentry-and-woodworking/how-to-build-a-trash-bin-with-a-butcher-block-countertop to both add some counter space to the kitchen bench but also to hide the bins away from a greyhound that likes to scavenge .

i know i am being petty and awful but i feel terrible .
my boyfriend told me he could only love me 99 .
i understand he has a dead wife but i thought i made some sort of leeway .
i wo n't be the woman he loved and i can never be .
this was the man i was willing to risk my future on .
i was willing to stay in a shit hole because he made it seem brighter than the beaches of california .
i would rather be alone than be that number .
so i think tomorrow we will break up and go our seperate ways .
but i have never been first in my life so this is nothing new .
i finished the story mode and figured i 'd mess around with some of the modules that people made .
honestly i 'm not that interested in dealing with folks online so figured i 'd do this locally .
once you 're in a game you can double-click on an empty character slot and add a self-controlled character to fill the gaps .
that works fine as far as i can tell .
i was hoping though that there was a way to make a few additional characters of my own and use them in the same manner .
unfortunately while i have more than one character created they do n't show up in the list only the story characters do .
is this simply not available or are there some rules to it i do n't understand ?
so having looked into some old coding based stuff i wonder if someone better experienced with the a858 posts might be able to look into the possibility of the code being used in some posts conforms to some of the older methods .
in short you make a certain sized grind and lay the letters into into it and then the output is the reading off of the grind .
so as an example a i 'll encode hello how are you in a 5 by 5 grid
this can also be done with different grid sizes or potentially with the space between the words also being used to have gaps in the grind to make something like this
another method similar the the substitutional cypher is a rolling cypher
so again using the example hello how are you ''
you change the letter by the stated numerical value then start again
i have no idea if either of these methods works and either way you 'd need the grid size in the first example to decode and in the second one you 'd pretty much need to know the exact rolling cypher used to have a shot .
or you 'd need a repeating word or phrase used regularly in their posts that could be decoded simply this way .
a deadeye is an item used in the standing and running rigging of traditional sailing ships .
it is a smallish round thick wooden usually lignum vitae disc with one or more holes through it perpendicular to the plane of the disc .
the three-holed blocks were called deadeyes because the position of the three holes resemble the eye and nose sockets of a sheep 's skull .

what the hell is going on why does this one boss have this happen more in 2 days than in my entire experience playing the game ?
i need to resign from my job asap due to another offer wanting me to work immediately 1 month .
unfortunately i have signed a contract with my current employer requiring me to give a 60 days notice period before my effective termination to undergo transition process .
i have only worked at the current company for 3 months so there is n't really much to transition .
what are the chances of me negotiating for an earlier date ?
here 's what stated on my contract should you wish to terminate this employment contract for any reason you are required to provide notification sixty 60 calendar days prior the effectivity of your resignation subject to approval of your manager to ensure you undergo a transition period .
it does n't seem to state any penalties for not following this item though .

played system shock 2 on a 50 inch tv with a steam controller and my g/f and i were just like 'jesus we never thought this would be possible in 1999 ! ! '
it was an absolute blast and just wanted to say thank you for all the efforts that made this possible .
i 've been trying for a while to remember any single particular story to tell about this woman because she was the first morbidly obese person i had ever seen and i had to deal with her for years because she was the after-school ymca childcare worker lady .
i 'm spacing out on what you call them happy new yers btw .
i did remember something the other day but it 's pretty weak so i decided i 'll just write out the entire history for you guys .
get two loaves of the cheap shit because that 's twice as much bread for sammiches ?
holy shit i 'm pretty messed up right now guys hopefully i think to proof-read and edit before submitting this .
when i was about six my family moved overseas and during the transition process we stayed with my grandparents in pa. for the second half of first grade i was in a new school with new teachers and new kids and new lunchladies .
that was the first time i saw her this massive thing of sweatpants greasy hair missing or dying teeth seriously one was black and had a fuckin ' hole through it and i swear she was 30 fupa .
i lived on military bases my whole life and never realized people could even get so big .
i was transfixed i had recently discovered sumo wrestling existed and thought that she was one of america 's greatest players moonlighting as a lunchlady so that she could take all the leftover food home every day .
by some stroke of bizarre luck the kid across from me mentioned something about the biggest/best sumo in the world at that time just as hamzilla came lumbering by .
half listening i excitedly blurt out you mean her ! ? ''
she did n't notice thankfully but the little shit i was sitting with saw who i was talking about and immediately tattled .
this was also the first time i ever felt actual panic in my life as she came over and gave me the death eye as he told on me .
i do n't remember what she said but i do remember that she was livid dragged me to an empty table and told me to finish my lunch there .
i was so embarrassed i decided not to bother with the whole friends '' thing after that because i 'd just be starting over in a few months and these people seemed like dicks .
the rest of my time there was uneventful we moved left the country and for two years no fat people in sight .
she was fading from my memory by the time we moved back but my mother had retired after that post and decided that we should settle down near her parents .
i ended up in another school district but i was soon to learn that hr stuffn'gut worked multiple jobs .
the old school was her lunchlady gig but at my new permanent school she ran the before/after school y-care and lucky us my brother and i got to attend both .
i 'm not sure if she remembered me but i do n't recall her ever being pleasant even once .
she was just a miserable twat as a default and for the next few years i got to deal with that .
in the mornings she was mostly quiet and let us do whatever while she read a newspaper and stuffed her face .
it usually smelled pretty awful and a bag of microwaved popcorn was her usual side-dish .
the various smells mixing with popcorn is just the weirdest aroma and it always stunk up the entire school in the mornings until lunch time flushed it out .
also if you brought your own food she 'd usually all but demand you share .
i decided not to eat whenever she was around .
she 'd always mispronounce my name and one day i just got fed up and refused to raise my hand during attendance until she did it right .
officially i think that was the day she fully decided i was one of the little shits that she wo n't ever be nice to because from then on i was watched for any sort of slip up and punished harshly .
i do n't remember what i did but she decided that for an indefinite period i was to be forced to sit at this one particular seat the entire time i was there .
a few weeks of this and my mother notices me going to the same seat every day and raises holy hell because that sort of punishment did not fit whatever it was i did not to mention they said nothing of it to her .
i was once again allowed to play with the other kids but i think it only made her focus on me more .
pokemon became popular basically overnight and every boy in my school was deeply afflicted .
i was starting to enjoy drawing and some cartoon or another had a good simple formula for fat people so i decided to copy that and apply it to pikachu .
pikafat i dubbed it and instead of electricity it shot chocolate from it 's cheeks .
thank the heavens i shared the details with one of my friends because as soon as snorlax saw what i was drawing she stormed over as if i had opened a box of cookies and said i was sharing .
she picked up the picture and screamed at me about shaming her and making fun of her weight .
i was dumbfounded because i honestly was n't ever trying to make a connection between her and pikafat but she kept going until my friend spoke up and told her for me .
he was one of those dorky always be honest '' kids so she believed him and i was saved .
after that however i started drawing fat people and pokemon obsessively simply to spite her .
she knew i was now drawing them to make fun of her but it had been publicly established that i was n't so she could n't do shit .
i never liked her before that but now i hated her .
just in case that was n't enough though she put the final nail in that coffin when she ruined one of my video game files .
i got some cheap handheld dot-matrix games one christmas like from tiger or tomy or some other long-dead toy company and was on a hot streak with hangman .
dozens of won games hundreds of thousands of points full lives i was doing great .
i set the game down on the table where slugma spent her morning life and went to play dodgeball with the other kids .
when i came back school was starting and i just shoved into my backpack and went to class .
later that day at lunch i fire up the game and reel back in horror .
she depleted my score to just a few thousand points .
i knew it was her too because there was cheeto dust on one of the buttons .
i was crushed there was no way i had it in me to get the score back to where it was any time soon and with the debris i was physically repulsed by the object .
she ruined it for me and i never played with it again after that .
thankfully the next year i went on to middle school and i was finally free .
she did n't work there but during my freshmen year one of the seniors had the same last name and i discovered they were family .
but here 's the weird part she was his step-mother .
yes this woman was proposed to by what i imagined was the loneliest man on earth or maybe she just really let herself go the moment she got that ring .
but i never had to deal with her again so that 's good .
my friend and i want to go backpacking for a couple of months .
but my backpack is already 17 kg 37 pound .
so instead of buying i do n't have a lot of money left a water filter could n't i just boil the water to get rid of viruses or bacteria ?

google glass is on the right track but it will probably be apple or a linux guy or kim dot com who ups the ante with a live streaming app centred around monitoring police actions .
we 're so worried about preventing the government from watching everything we do that we have n't seriously considered coming at it from another angle let everybody watch everything you do at least when you are out in public .
the infrastructure required for this is massive but we are getting there .
i can for see it being added to your 'rights ' that you must be informed if you are not being recorded/monitored as it will be so common place that we all assume we always are at least in cities .
there will be signs at the city limits advising that you are no longer being monitored once you leave town .
thing is all the video will be public domain .
the courts and the media can not censor it or restrict access .
and there will be so much of it that you get lost in the noise unless you specifically flag an event .

having someone close to you that wants to kill themselves or has attempted it .
i was suicidal from age 12 to about 19 and i thought everyone around me who was concerned for me forced me to go to therapy tried to keep an eye on me etc .
was being selfish because should n't i be allowed to make that decision if i 'm not happy ?
then i got with my fiance who has also been suicidal from a young age .
he actually tried to shoot himself in the head several years ago he was a teenager but the gun did n't go off for some reason .
he still wants to kill himself now and it 's extremely stressful for me .
i always said that if i knew someone that wanted to kill themselves i would let them do it because it 's up to them and not my business but now i totally understand what it 's actually like to think that someone you love is going to off themselves .
i understand what it 's like to know someone is hurting and i know what it 's like to call them over and over again hoping that they 're not dead because they 're not answering their phone .
i understand what it 's like to have someone try to distance you so they can kill themselves causing as little damage to you as possible .
i see it from the other side now and i feel so bad about doing those same thing to people that i love .
my brother and my father also both tried to kill themselves and i did n't know about it until after the fact .
i felt so bad about not being there for them even though it 's not my fault because i did n't even know .
now i know what it 's like to think that someone tried to kill themselves in the same house that you live in .
that i was only a few feet or a phone call away and they still felt that was the best option .
that it would have killed me to lose them and they tried it anyway .
i always said i would never call suicide selfish but i understand that view now .
i still do n't call it selfish ... but i do understand that viewpoint now .

2 go towards the monsters/enemy and use your w to unburrow it 's very important that you use w instead of right clicking .
right clicking makes the animation really long and you wo n't be able to aa until after the animation is completed .
when using your w you will be able to aa faster .
3 after the aa has hit use your q as soon as possible .
it 's an aa reset and makes your dps higher .
this is extremely important when ganking and on early level clears .
4 keep aa'ing and using q as an aa reset until you can knock the monsters up again with your w and repeat .
also if you 're low/on early clears you can benefit of his passive by waiting around a little under the ground for your passive to heal you .

excalibro 's bro blade is at a measly 15 crit chance but it has the potential to crit for every enemy hit and it has the potential to hit many enemies .
so it might be a good idea to build crit if you go naralibur .
ah i was posting about cartoon characters i had crushes on when i was younger .
you ceased to have an independent existence as did everyone else in the world .
during that time your secrets were laid bare for all to see as were those of every other living creature on earth including the members of at least two different conspiracies that knew this was coming and spent the entire angel crisis attempting to set it up to benefit their own goals and you should know this because as i previously said neither they nor you have a distinct discrete self nor any secrets .

natalie portman 's character adds nothing whatsoever to the story and thor 's interest in her is so shoehorned in that it breaks the suspension of disbelief in a way that alien gods with magic hammers never could .
it 's partially redeemed by the fact that natalie becomes a major plot point in the sequel but even then the scenes of thor moping around over his brief encounter with a member of a lesser species still detracted from it .
i mean is n't it basically bestiality from an asgardian perspective ?
one of the better decisions that was made in avengers was not having thor go visit his crush because he was too busy saving the world and shit .

the maps are a lot larger than previous halos due to sprint .
15 increase would make the game too fast as well as killing a lot of momentum you can gain with sprint slide jumping etc .
do me a favor and play midship in halo 2 or halo 3 then go back to halo 5 .
action is much easier to find in halo 2/3 due to a much smaller map and was a big reason those maps remained fan favorites for years .
so i 'm really curious as to why you think halo 5 would be too fast-paced with a speed boost increase on the level that was received in past games especially when the maps have been ballooned as large as they have been .
i ignored the part about past competition settings being at 110 movement speed because i did n't think you were being serious with that argument .
completely different games completely different ttk different maps etc .
a 10 speed boost is a 10 speed boost .
if it did n't have a dramatic game-breaking effect in other halo games i really doubt it 's going to ruin the game in this one .
you can tell this is a popular idea by the amount of downvotes your post is getting
the halo community has never been smaller and the game never more obscure and unpopular .
most of the people on this sub are people who really do n't care about the changes this franchise has had since 2010 .
i would really avoid using downvotes on a sub where people avoid conversation on controversial topics .

the ability to add an additional block and rad is pretty awesome .
nothing is approved for players to use unless the dm says so .
the dm has final say on everything end of story .
it 's basically the golden rule of pathfinder and d d .
if i say you cant mount a trap on a portable anything then you ca n't .
i do n't care if raw says so i 'm disallowing it because it could obviously and easily break the game .
secondly if i throw a vampire with class levels at you you ca n't make your next character a vampire just because i had a vampire with class levels as an enemy .
players do n't have a right to use a specific thing just because the dm uses it against them .
you ca n't require the dm to do anything .
you can raise concerns but if you do n't like a final ruling your options are deal with it or leave the group .
that said i try to be fairly transparent with my players and usually try to encourage creative ideas but i draw the line at gamebreaking ideas .
this includes cheap or most ways of getting infinite anything .
but if i had a player so dead set on doing something like this i might let them .
then after a few sessions i 'd have the enemy roll up with heal bots and the players would quickly stop having fun with enemies having the same infinite healing robots that they now have .
perhaps do n't require full teams but instead help people that can bring 2-3 people with them say .
if a prize was involved i 'd recommend skins not cash keep it in steam .

before you guys downvote me sometimes you play devils advocate just for the sake of looking at it from all angles .
my question is ... who cares about a fit .
do n't you just want to find the best player and figure the fit later ?
no player on the teams you named are above 20 or are on a team seriously considering making a run .
do n't you think it just comes down to best available ?
from that point of view ... how would you rank best available from the draft ?

it 's true that when you make money say something increases in value some other people are losing money .
however for it to be zero-sum the summation of the amount that people are making and the amount people are losing have to be obviously zero by definition it has to be exactly zero .
once someone releases data stating that the total gains earned by the players '' mirror the total losses of all other players '' over the course of the entire stock market you can say it 's zero-sum .
there 's also the more common misconception that zero-sum '' means each trade is zero-sum .
in that if you make money on a trade and then close that position then the guy on the other side of your trade must be losing money .
let 's assume that 's true that he is losing money .
for it to be zero-sum he has to lose the amount you make which means he needs to have the exact same position size as you in a trade that exactly mirrors yours and exit his position at the exact same time you do .
and then you must consider that everyone is trading differently and just because you buy stock and go on to have a winning trade does n't inherently mean the guy who sold you the stock had a losing trade .
you could be buying stock at 50 and end up having a winning trade but the guy who sold you the stock could have been holding since 20 .
say the stock goes up to 55 after a week and you sell the guy who buys at 55 might hold several months until 75 .
say you originally bought your stock at 50 from a short seller perhaps the stock dropped to 48 before rising to 55 and the short seller exited at 48 for a gain .
every single person in these examples won despite having different positions and goals at completely different times .
even options ca n't be said to be zero-sum because their pricing model is n't linear .
if you win in options that most certainly means whoever is holding the other end of the transaction lost but that still does n't mean your gains and losses directly offset each other .
however you could say it 's zero-sum if you only consider who wins/loses as in chess but once you bring monetary amounts into it it 's no longer zero-sum .
sorry the idea that the markets are zero-sum always baffles me .
anyone capable of basic math and even the slightest bit of logic can see that .
did n't know if the idea of zero-sum '' was important to your entry into the markets .
is it possible to play the market badly and is it possible to play it well ?
what is an example of playing the market badly or well other than results ?
you can say you 're intelligent disciplined able to learn but if you do n't have returns you 're not playing '' well .

my friend she started playing a few weeks before i did .
dubai chapter 1 and rage quit because i could n't beat those penguins i did n't know about meatshielding then .
a few weeks later she persuaded me to start playing again .
only beat dubai because i got a titan in the cat capsule .
and that 's when i got hooked to the game .
she eventually got bored of the game and quit after completing chapter 1 .
but i did not and now look how far i 've come-i 'm at low tide beach only two chapters away from the great escaper .

you were saying there was a lot of men hate on feminist subs .
i checked out the r/feminism sub in response to this and then posted .
not trying to throw up road blocks or dodge the obvious i was just actually curious about whether or not this was the case .
obviously what constitutes hate is subjective but i did n't find anything like the examples you 've given in the feminism sub .

i 've got a solar panel with a pre-attached charge controller .
the 'load ' output wires on the charge controller do n't seem to be working ever below are the options i 've attempted to get it working
attempt no.|battery attached ? panel in sun ? load indicator state ?
note 12v battery with 12v rated panel which does a max of 18v but is regulated to 12v .
the battery is a 12v 9ah sla which apparently charge up to like 13.6v or so ?
the charge controller has indicator leds for 'charging ' and 'load/discharge ' .
statement is when i try to measure the voltage across the two load wires .
i 've also got the arduino hooked up to the load wires at the same time but it was never on .
i spoke to the panel supplier they did n't help .
ideally what i want to do is have the panel set up to charge the sla battery with the arduino being powered 24/7 off the battery .
this is a remote system without mains power available .
the arduino sleeps for 15 minutes intervals the overall current draw is relatively low .
is there an easy and viable way to directly connect up the arduino to the battery whilst it is being charged by the solar panel ?
the battery should last 30 days without recharging so a flat battery should n't be an issue unless i get a month of no sun highly unlikely .
was curious about the orchard just north of arrowhead hospital .

i 've been incredibly depressed lately and about a week ago my cousin gave me an adderall pill .
i instantly liked it and have been taking them everyday .
the thing is i 'm on parole and will probably get drug tested next week .
yet the sick depressed part of me just keeps saying who cares fail the drug test and go back to jail you belong there anyway your worthless .
during character creation tonight my group and i stumbled onto a moral dilemma of sorts .
we will be playing a typical evil necromancer villain like campaign so i decided to make a barbarian that worship or believes in death but not in a negative way .
when i ran this idea by my group members they automatically assumed that the character was evil but were shocked when i said that he was lawful good and asked how could someone that worships death be good ?
i argued that simply that he thinks that death is a natural part of mortal life and that it is n't something to fear but to be embraced when it comes .
i want some other opinions on this matter would you let a barbarian that worships death into your adventure group ?
if i press the power button power light blinks for a second and turns off .

a few questions for those of you who have used either of these cards how do they play ?
secondly i know neither of these guys are killing it this year but who do you think is more likely to turn it on down the stretch ?
my guess would be johnson but any input would be appreciated .
lastly who do you think will experience a bigger price jumps next upgrade ?
both are 87 's and would jump to 89 .
kane 's stats would be 91 91 89 87 85 and johnson 's would be 92 90 91 82 88 .
prepare to witness the beauty of frosted flakes mage an important part of a nutritious climbing experience .
first play a stranglethorn tiger at a point where you feel relatively safe .
then play frost nova djinni of zephyrs and pray to kellogs that they have no removal for it in hand .
next turn attack their face with both minions and then play polymorph boar on tony turning the dude from aladdin into a boar as well and then go face with both again .
at this point you 've done 17 damage and you can follow up with another polymorph boar or play some more cards to survive longer .
frosted flakes package this includes frost nova blizzard cone of cold and in emergencies frostbolt and ice lance .
antonidas combo with frost nova to get it to survive or play it with frostbolt and ice lance to do a lot of direct damage .
emperor thaurissan mainly i use this dude to reduce the cost of my combo cards and once my opponent was so busy killing him that they missed lethal .
i do n't like those cards so use this .
actually it 's a worse version of freeze mage but you get style points for winning .

was wondering if anyone would actually be interested in these ?
i 'd love to have a few on my wall or something just for show .
obviously they 're plastic and harmless but you could still do tricks with the karambit and they 'll look damn fine .
quick edit i read that csgo accessory advertising is allowed so i hope this is okay !
not technically advertising but in the future i 'll be releasing my website for this once i 've got many many knife prototypes and examples website is up right now but not ready for the public obviously !

chinese wall of text incoming not a native english speaker so please excuse the occasional odd wording .
okay i consider writing this stuff down partly a form of self-therapy .
but of course i am also looking for advice in general .
i have included a tl dr at the bottom for those understandably not willing to endure my 1400 words of rambling .
since the end of my first and only relationship that lasted about 2.5 years and was mostly great i 've been single for about 8 years now .
during these 8 years my success with women consisted of 2 drunken make-out sessions with old acquaintances and a one-night stand with a lovely stranger during a short vacation-trip .
it 's not nothing but it is not very far from resembling the dark void of nothingness .
or to put it more jokingly i have had so little sex these years hat i fear my virginity might be coming back .
and i do n't feel so great about it .
i live in a european country and am now in my early thirties .
i 've got an engineering degree and a humanities degree currently working on my doctoral thesis .
in my country i am of below average male height i am 5¬¥8.5 average is 5¬¥11 i guess it 's not too bad but i am pretty certain that it hindered my chances multiple times .
i look quite young for my age up to the point that people often request that i show them my id to proof that i actually am 30 .
most of those 8 years i 've been ‚Äì with maybe a year-long exception ‚Äì in pretty good shape .
i think my current body-fat percentage is around 12/13 .
i do n't have ripped abs but i have visible muscle tone and feel quite good about my body bar the fact that i have a quite round/fatty face compared to my body-fat .
it 's actually quite hard to assess one 's attractiveness regarding the last bit but i would say that i am probably pretty average .
i am certainly not brad pitt but people wo n't mistake me for quasimodo 's cousin either .
still it is something i am very self-conscious about since the below-average height the youthful appearance i consider it to be both a blessing and a curse and round face put some chinks into the ideal of looking like a manly man .
oh yeah and i still ca n't grow a something that resembles something that people would consider a beard .
apparently i 'll be waiting till my forties for that .
in stark contrast to that i have a deep powerful voice that people seem to generally consider as pleasant .
the people in my social circles usually consider me to be very smart and funny .
through reasons i really have n't completely figured out myself you can throw me into quite a variety of social groups and people in them tend to like me regardless of gender .
this has not always been the case but is something i somehow developed over the last years .
so you can consider me to be quite sociable .
if you were to meet me your first impression would probably be that of someone who is somewhat but not excessively outgoing and confident .
i have hobbies good friends and am quite well-traveled but have much more to see .
this of course stands in diametric contradiction to my debilitating anxiety of doing anything that looks like unambiguously expressing sexual interest the plot thickens ! .
and when i say debilitating i actually mean paralyzing .
i know that it 's perfectly normal to get anxious about this but it 's the one aspect of my personality that i ca n't seem to improve on even the slightest bit .
i can cope with many social situations that average persons are afraid of like public speaking 3 people 30 people 300 people ?
do n't care for example but the thought of unambiguously expressing sexual interest puts me into a state of almost mortal fear almost all the time .
for clarification what i mean by unambiguously expressing sexual interest are any actions that convey said interest in the mind of the average person and that are not ambiguous in the sense that they could also be actions that are considered appropriate between friends .
being a charming bastard making small or big talk with people i just met regardless of gender ?
i have never done this even once in the whole of my life .
naked paralyzing fear that no amount of alcohol can drown believe me i 've tried .
in comparison if a pal chat 's up a group of people with a woman i consider attractive i can instantly join the fray .
touching that crosses that border grabbing hand close leg/body touching .
online dating changes nothing in this regard for me since it just transforms the problem .
writing that first message is no different to me than approaching someone in real life because it 's the intent that matters not the medium .
i really really really suck at assessing possible indicators of sexual interest .
i can interpret most social situations very well but i still am extremely bad at reading this particular part of social interactions .
i know there are guides and published studies on this but i ca n't figure this out .
it 's like everybody else has some kind of sixth sense that i lack .
i often get the feeling that simply am almost universally classified as someone that is highly likeable but ‚Äì please pardon my french ‚Äì highly unfuckable i know this sounds a bit like it but i am not an adherent of the theory that there is a mystical placed called the friend zone i am of the opinion that there are crumbs of truth behind the concept but it 's not something i endorse as something with explanatory value .
i often wonder if this is due to my aforementioned lack of perception skills or just cruel reality .
for some years now i got this idea into my head that even if there is someone that might be attracted to me her social circle the venue etc .
necessarily must include someone she 's more attracted to and that it 's pretty much settled that she 's going to end up with that person .
this particular thought enters my brain me so frequently that i just refer to it by the designation of there 's always a bigger fish nerd-tangent this line is one of the very few thing i enjoyed about the phantom menace .
there have been numerous occasions where this actually happened which has n't helped in eliminating this kind of irrational thinking .
those of my friends that know that i 've been single for this long do n't get it and try to lift me up with the usual encouragements .
my best friend is trying his best to keep my spirits up but he actually makes me feel worse because he is successful with women occasionally those i am attracted to and i get envious .
which makes me feel even worse because i despise myself for feeling envious because i should n't be and it 's not his fault .
i actually have a certain social circle of people that i do n't consider friends but still acquaintances of me that i like and often see .
but i figure that they think i must be normal .
i know that a lot of my thoughts and beliefs that i just depicted are actually irrational or at least not as rational as i tend to make them out to be and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì very counterproductive if i want to improve my situation/outlook .
thing is i know this but i still just ca n't get them out of my head .
human male early thirties with good social skills but some reservation about looks still ca n't overcome his paralyzing fear of unambiguously expressing sexual interest .
i ca n't silence/talk down my inner voices/feelings/thoughts that keep me down even though i know that they are counterproductive and not entirely rational .
i am terrified that i am too old to change .
and where can i get a copy of that sixth sense that people seem to use to assess sexual interest of others ?
one of the two made fgs is a dunk over the incredible defender d'angelo russell .
there are 100 points to be given to a group of 10 people .
each other turn one random person is eliminated from the group .
you give points to random people doubling your points when they are not eliminated .
what would be the best mathematical way to ensure you have maximum points ?
for example round 1 you give each person 10 points .
however you also know that one of the persons you gave points will be eliminated therefore you win 9x10 1x10 80 points .
however you also might give 5 random people 20 points possibly winning the full 100 point bonus if one of these 5 is not eliminated .
but you also stand to lose 20 points from your bonus if the person in your group is eliminated .
round two you have only 9 people which you give a share of the points you have so far .

been running a node relay non-exit for about 5 years .
since the new year i noticed that my node went down and that it did not appear on the usual places http torstatus.blutmagie.de/router_detail.php ? fp=78382b769d5d3baa41e89e5d9d7ff88e1a96a6b3 and https atlas.torproject.org details/78382b769d5d3baa41e89e5d9d7ff88e1a96a6b3 with the last seen timestamp of 2015-12-31 20:00:00 .
i run my node on a dedicated server under my physical control .
i checked the tor process and in the system it was running with the logs showing
notice heartbeat it seems like we are not in the cached consensus .
i confirmed and double checked all my settings and restarted my tor node but still noticed that it was not appearing as running on globe https globe.torproject.org relay/78382b769d5d3baa41e89e5d9d7ff88e1a96a6b3 or atlas https atlas.torproject.org details/78382b769d5d3baa41e89e5d9d7ff88e1a96a6b3 after almost 6 hours .
i noticed on the logs i was getting notice your network connection speed appears to have changed .
resetting timeout to 60s after 18 timeouts and 1000 buildtimes . ''
i tried to open tor browser on my personal use computer and it stalls in connecting to a relay directory '' with connecting to a relay directory failed no route to host 86.59.21.38:443 '' .
i was however able to connect with orbot on my smartphone after several retries .
that 's when i tried to ping and do a trecepath to tor directory authorities https atlas.torproject.org search/flag authority
of the ten tor directory authorities i was not able to ping and tracepath any of them using my isp telefonos del noroeste telnor .
but i was able to ping and tracepath all of the directory authorities using riseup 's vpn servie https black.riseup.net .
i even tried to traceroute directly with the isp provided internet router and was still not able to get thru to any tor directory authority or even a tor node

i have a dynamic ip so i rebooted the isp provided router and tried with several ip 's that where assigned by my isp and all provided the same results .
i plan on doing more testing and calling my isp and asking directly about the ip 's i am not able to reach and specifically if they block or plan on blocking tor .
they confirmed that i can not access the ip 's but do n't have any info about why i am not able to access .
they said telnor connections to the rest of the world is thru the u.s. from telnor no blocking is made to the rest of the world .
i 'm not seeing any tor nodes with telnor/telmex/infinitum at http torstatus.blutmagie.de/index.php only axtel and megared .
i am sometimes able to connect to longclaw '' longclaw.riseup.net 199.254.238.53 but not always .

can anyone from mexico with telnor/telmex/infinitum ping/traceroute the directory authorities https atlas.torproject.org search/flag authority successfully ?
posted to tor-relays mailing list but seeing as there are no more tor nodes with telmex/telnor/infinitum i will have to change isp .
meanwhile i donated 100 to torproject.org still waiting on my t-shirt though .

i have thought for a long time about how when and honestly if i would write this .
but with some time and healing behind me and the start of a new year i felt that it was time .
as i 'm sure you know by now my wife i divorced a little over a year ago .
at the time we put a lot of thought into what we considered an appropriately benign and simple statement which we released together announcing this sad news .
a very good and wise friend someone who has also gone through some hard things publicly gave what i consider valuable counsel while your instinct and people 's expectation might be to go into a lot of detail in what you share publicly about a situation like this it 's very rarely a good idea .
but with some perspective and much personal health and growth over the past year it now feels incongruent to leave the subject unaddressed publicly .
i can imagine that many of you felt and maybe still feel confused disappointed angry even at hearing the news of our split .
there was an understanding a trust broken between you and me .
i 've heard it said that trust takes years to build and seconds to break .
my hope is that this writing might be the first step towards rebuilding that trust .
in the brief statement that was released about our divorce it said that i took full responsibility for the events that led to the decision .
that is true but i want to take this opportunity to say more .
i betrayed the trust of my family my friends my community .
and i betrayed the trust and support that many of you have entrusted me with for many many years .
what started as a brief inappropriate and quickly confessed connection with a very old friend evolved quickly into something more serious which was hidden from spouses and friends .
it continued in secret for a matter of months was eventually discovered and set into motion the consequences that i will now live with for the rest of my life .
i believed lies which led me to tell lies .
it 's insane how quickly it becomes rational and reasonable to believe and do destructive and evil things .
as much as i wish i could i simply can not change what i 've done nor the resulting consequences .
i can only own these despicable actions which have left me completely devastated and deeply ashamed .
sometimes no matter how bad you want it or how hard you fight for it broken things just ca n't be mended .
the only path forward from here is to continue focusing on health healing my children parents and investing in safe community .
that brings me to one of the most important things i can emphasize .
through what 's easily been the hardest few years of my life many friends left a precious few stayed and some new friends showed up for which i am so grateful and without whom i might not have survived .
for most of my life and certainly as these events transpired i have been dramatically under-resourced with people around me with whom i have been truly vulnerable who really knew me .
the importance of having a handful even just one or two safe people in your life with whom you can and do truly share everything especially the hardest and most shameful things can not be overstated .
i see this as one of the most important and life-altering changes that this devastation has brought about in my life .
although it took time i found a wise therapist several groups of men with whom i spend regular time and a handful of friends who i consider to be among the best i 've ever had .
i would plead with you to find a small group of safe men or women friends who will not respond with platitudes of morality but will instead get down and not only join you but stay with you in your shit in hopes of helping pull you out .
inevitably they 'll need you to join them in theirs someday .
you might be a man or woman reading this even now finding yourself exactly where i was two years ago seriously considering choices that could destroy your life your family and maybe yourself .
if that 's you please listen to me what you think you want what you think you can have is not real and you 'll lose real things pursuing it .
as an unfortunately and extremely reliable source please believe me .
so if you 're standing on that steep ledge stop .
at very least risk telling someone immediately and give opportunity to hearing some understanding and perspective maybe some sanity restoring words that might be the small disruption needed to shake you awake .
the tone spirit of the songs i 've written over the last decade or so have sometimes been called prophetic a term that i 've worn with extreme discomfort .
but it turns out my songs have been eerily prophetic in my own story .
'i am a whore i do confess but i put you on like a wedding dress and i run down the aisle . '
hard as they have always been to sing i am especially grateful to have those words to confess today as i 've never known them to be more deeply true of myself as i am running down that aisle still .
there has always been some measure of distance between me and the content of my songs .
there 's a sense in which even the most confessional of my songs like 'wedding dress ' or it 's more recent sibling 'heavy ' felt like they were about someone else .
so the accidentally prophetic sting of those songs is especially acute and painful in light of my great failures .
songs like those have never been more difficult to sing but i 've never been more grateful to have to .
i 've said recently that my songs feel like my personal liturgy things that i do n't necessarily or always believe but i show up to recite again and again in hopes of believing them .
if i 'm honest most of the time i do n't believe the words in my songs .
i have a hard time believing in a god that could make let alone love a man who could do such things .
so i 'll go on reciting and adding to my liturgy in hopes of believing the words because i wish to .

i 've recently gotten a new pc and everything is running great .
i have encountered only one issue so far my keyboard stops working in certain usb ports when i open certain apps .
it works fine in google chrome and on windows but when i open a program such as mumble or a game such as cs go it stops working .
i know it 's receiving power still since the lights are on i just ca n't do anything .
if i press the caps lock the light on the keyboard does n't even change .
i can change the usb port it 's plugged into to one of them on the side it does n't work in all the rear usb ports and it works fine it 's just those ports are in the way of my chair and i 'm worried i 'm going to snap whatever is plugged in there .
my keyboard is just a cheap one from amazon so there 's no drivers or nothing available .
edit i have 4 usb ports at the back of my pc which all had something plugged in mouse keyboard wifi adapter and a bluetooth adapter for my headset and when i removed the bluetooth adapter from the port everything was working fine .
could it be an issue of power and not enough being supplied ?
i presume not if not is there a query to sort bugs by 'having the most duplicates ' ?
was just thinking about how there 's tons of duplicates but i imagine not everyone who files a duplicate votes for the original which is maybe-fine but maybe also under-represents the importance/annoyance of certain bugs especially those not easily searchable by title when sorting by votes .
my query-fu is not very strong so i dunno if there 's a way to write a query that e.g .
finds the 'top ' bugs as measured by 'votes duplicates ' and was just curious .

i 've got an ipod nano 4 whose battery died and a touch 4 which is fine .
id like to buy a new 7th gen nano but first i would like a picture comparing the nano 7 with the touch 4 sizes .
i cant get then anywhere near my city to see their size in my hands .
so i 've thought that someone here might have both models and could grab me some pictures if that is n't much trouble .
all the videos i 've found were comparing the 7th nano with the touch 5 ...
not wake up to have to deal with another day of this big hole of sadness and despair in my chest and stomach .
it consumes my thoughs my willpower my energy and my will to live every second and minute of the day .
i hate my life i hate myself and i hate my depression .
my life is in no way bad i have no real reason to be depressed and still i am sad every minute of every waking hour .
a simple rejection makes me hate myself even more and that in turn makes me hate the fact that i hate myself .
i 've tried shrinks medication socialicing working out everything i have read up on .
and i am completly wrecked thinking i want to die '' just those three words multiple times a day .
my life consists of trying to get trough the day not being able to do anything productive outside work just wanting to sleep so my mindre stops having all theese thoughs and the black hole stops hurting if just for a while .
i do not want to live like this not being able to do anything just makes me more depressed but trying to do things makes me wanting nothing more than to go back to my bed and cry myself to sleep .
i could n't stand being around my family and friends this christmas because i cant focus on the good things in life i can only obsess over the bad .
2016 had a horrible start i hosted a party for my friends and from the second they arrived i wanted nothing more than for the day to be over because i dont know how to communicate that i am fucking broken and i dont enjoy anything .
i just want it to be over and to have some rest .
so last week i went to my local bargain store and grabbed some older techno cd 's
a few minutes ago i passed by a song called born slippy '' by darren emerson when i noticed holy hell this is totally the intro to white nuxxle driver ''

is there a version of just tyler singing this without the fans ?
i 'm getting married later this year and would love to use this version .
it 's the middle of the freaking night and i 'm sitting downstairs waiting to see if i 'm going to throw up or not .
i would hate hate hate morning sickness not to mention i do n't deal well with other people throwing up either .
to be completely honest this situation is kinda my own fault because i ate too much at new years dinner yesterday while i was pretty recently diagnosed with ibs irritable bowel syndrome .
but that does n't change the fact that i am slightly freaking out because of very bad experiences with throwing up when i was younger so many hospital stays.. caused by my then still undiagnosed other chronic illness .
throwing up was basically me going into shock because of this illness .
which means if i do start throwing up i could basically end up going into shock and obviously ending up in a hospital .
so no i could never do the whole pregnancy thing or looking after babies/kids who might spew on you .
i 'm never eating that much again that 's for sure .
mydria arys and borys were walking slowly slowly through the dense wood surrounding old oak .
it 's probably not true you know arys whispered tauntingly breaking the silence .
if it was true father would know and if father knew he would have found it already.
then why did you even come if you do n't believe it ? myrdria hissed .
her green eyes peered down at her younger brother 's blank pupils .
well you were bringing borys with you and he 's barely old enough to dress himself ! arys retorted .
how could you take care of him when you ca n't even take of yourself ? ary 's dark eyes squinted at his sister disapprovingly so tight they looked almost like empty holes on his face in the dark night .
borys trailing behind his two siblings spoke up before myrdria could fight back .
i 've been dressing myself for almost a full moon ! he complained .
and unlike you i do n't have broke eyes !
myrdria rounded on her heels and bent down to borys ' face .
you do n't talk to your brother like that .
his eyes are n't broken. she then flipped to face arys and stuck a finger between his chest .
and the only reason borys wanted to come anyway was because you would n't be quiet about this in the first place .
i would have been fine doing this by myself if you had n't followed me down the halls trying to talk me out of it .
so if you want to stay here you better shut up or i 'll make you leave ! arys glared at her before looking at the ground in defeat .
good now unless you guys have anything be quiet .
if we get caught out here we might not get another chance to look for it. satisfied that she had taken back control myrsinia took the lead as the trio continued their trek into the forest .
it was her who had originally found out about the treasure .
she had heard it from one of her favorite handmaidens tansell .
she was one of her younger ladies barely twenty and she was also one of the most gregarious .
she was always the one who knew which serving girl fancied which knight and which gardener had spent a little too long with the stable boys .
on this day in particular tanselle had chosen to tell her a story she had heard from one of the older handmaidens who had served her aunt .
way up in her room in the maiden 's tower there were multiple carvings in the wall telling grand stories of her ancestors .
apparent myrdria 's grandmother had told aunt myrsinia who had told the handmaiden who had told tanselle that one of the carvings was actually a map to a special treasure hidden by one of the princesses of old oak .
while tanselle was brushing out myrdria 's hair she pointed out a tall grey tree carved into the ceiling with a golden oval surrounded by rays of sun nestled in the heart of the tree as she told the story .
long ago back before you and me were born before the targaryens ruled westeros before the first gardener king had controlled the oakhearts the oakhearts were king 's and queen 's themselves .
one of the kings of old oak had had a daughter and this princess was one of the prettiest women that had been born in over a century some say her beauty rivaled princess janette herself who this tower was made for
you know that story right ? tanselle had said breaking the mood .
yes ! myrdria had said impatiently get to the part about the treasure !
tanselle laughed alright well this princess was the prettiest princess to be born in a long time .
so of course almost a hundred princes and lords and even small folk had come to old oak to ask for her hand .
the king had denied many of them but they still kept coming and with them they brought many different gifts they brought with them treasures small and large casks full of silver and gold bags of different jewels and gemstones paintings that tried to capture the essence of her beauty even beautifully crafted swords and shields with the emblem of house oakheart .
all of these noble and small men alike brought treasures from all over westeros to win the heart of the princess.
luckily the princess was n't just pretty but she was also smart .
when she sent her suitors away she made sure to keep all of their gifts and hide them away up in the maiden tower where no one else but her most trusted handmaidens could come .
with each new potential husband her collection would grow larger and larger until she was forced to carpet her floor with her treasure and she even gave some away to her handmaidens so she had enough room in her bed to sleep.
unfortunately she eventually had to marry it would n't be seemly to have a princess become an old maid .
eventually she found the perfect husband and they had a fantastic wedding as soon as they met but she knew that the marriage meant that she must give up her treasure .
you see she did n't want to embarrass her new husband by showing him all of the wonderful gifts so many other men had given her so they had to be hidden away.
the night before her marriage the princess packed all her treasures in every clothing trunk money box and coffer she owned and gathered all her sisters cousins and handmaidens to go out and hide it .
they collected enough horses and mules to carry the presents and they rode out towards the outer forests of old oak until they found the biggest tree in the land and the princess hid her cache.
the day after the princess married her husband and collected the rest of her belongings to go live at his castle but not before carving the image of the tree she found to hide her treasure into the ceiling .
it was her wish that one day another oakheart princess would find the treasure again and bring it into the family once again. tanselle finished the tale off with a neat braid down the center of myrdria 's back .
after what seemed like hours the three oakhearts came across a particularly thick tree that sprout out high above the leaves of all the other trees .
they all paced around the trunk trying to spot the top of it through the leaves .
this has to be the tree it 's bigger than any other one we 've seen. arys fell to his butt and began to rub his cramped feet .
myrdria continued to circle the tree looking for any place that might be used as a hidden spot .
borys followed close behind her marvelling at the height of the tree .
well mydria began there should be some bush or something .
do you even know what you 're looking for ?
i-i thought we would be able to find it once we got here but there 's nothing here .
it 's probably the biggest tree in the whole reach !
maybe someone already came and took it. borys offered .
if someone else had already found it we would know. myrdria assured him .
maybe it 's at the top of the tree where we ca n't see it. said borys .
how could you fit a room full of trunks on the top of a tree ? asked arys i bet i was right all along .
we just walked around in the dark for an hour for nothing arys climbed back onto his feet and grabbed borys .
i 'm going back home and i 'm taking borys with me .
you can come back when you realize you were wrong. he told myrdria .
as the two boys walked off myrdria continued staring at the tree .
maybe there was some door inside the tree or a map written into the bark .
or ... maybe she missed something else written on the ceiling .
maybe there was some clue the princess had left in her room that she just needed to find .
that 's what she needed to do get more clues .
confident that she was right myrdria turned back towards the castle to return home .
but do n't have a clue who to upgrade .
does anyone know if the game is sold out tonight ?
works i still be able to get tickets at the gate ?
so i 'll either drink or not and just leave it at that .

this has been the most frustrating two days ever then i go to play civ v my card is at a low temp i load a custom multiplayer game and change my resolution after doing this the game crashes and blue screens .
i am able to restart my computer and load it normally i restart load civ it crashes at same spot .
upon reloading prebios i am getting four rows of s and artifacts my pc ca n't even boot into windows normally without getting a bluescreen from nvidia bsod 116 .
my card is not overclocked beyond factory and was not overheating nor close to it at the time .
i have found several people reporting the exact same issue happening to them upon civ v crashing .
i have tried everything i 'm currently stuck using intel integrated as i have absolutely no money right now this 60hz is killing my eyes .
the worst part is my graphics card has a lifetime warranty if you register it within 30 days but i apparently never did that because i was 16 and had no idea of a lifetime warranty on my card .
this has been so frustrating i 'm not even sure how civ v can kill my card it was running beautifully for years with no issues and then it just randomly dies ...
if you have it feel free to add me .

i appreciate if you post here or to my profile before adding me .
it will be interesting to see how goals work long-term .
i really like them right now everybody does and for things like annual payments costco aaa amazon prime etc .
but i have noticed that it is really tempting to set goals for all my savings categories which is also great but i wonder how that will affect rule 3 i generally roll with the punches by moving money out of savings categories holidays birthdays vacation etc .
and if that makes things turn yellow i wonder what kind of psychological impact that will have on the whole method .
so i 've actually tried nofap in the past and failed many times .
i also believe a lot of the anti-porn stuff is bs..
but i ca n't deny the fact that when i fap all the time i 'm out of energy and feel no sexual desire .
and that 's coming from a 17 year old .
i 've already started my nofap journey yesterday 1/1/2016 .
what i 've learned from my past journeys cold showers help never touch your penis never go near websites or part of websites that even could feature porn constantly stay around people and go in public so you ca n't pet the snake get a web extension that blocks all kinky stuff do n't watch movies that feature hot women and kinky stuff do n't play video games that feature hot women pinch yourself when horny.. hard .
i sound like i 'm against porn and masturbation but i 'm not .
i 'm doing this for me because i always feel like crap..
lately it seems i 've been denying that i feel like crap because everyone around me denies that masturbating can make you feel like crap and that i 've also tried denying it because i wanted to masturbate .
but from my own experience fap very low energy do n't fap for a couple of days more energy .
every time i fap the next few days i feel like crap .
i feel like a 50 year old man with low testosterone .
but in order to not relapse i 'm going to need your help.. give me some more tips than i 've already mentioned .
just wondering what you guys are thinking of barberio ?

i 'm having an ongoing battle against all four of my miners spontaneously losing internet connections at precisely 3 o'clock every morning .
i 'm wondering what would happen if i just put them all on a timer to kill power to them at like 2:30 and then bring them back at 3:30 .
this is essentially what i do when their shrieking wakes me up but i 'd i could automate the process that would be nice .
i 've always been under the impression that toggling the switch was bad for them and this seems like it would be the same thing .
is there somewhere in rochester that i could join to have access to a laser cutter ?

i 've just come back from the holidays and one of my ds4 controllers has a strange issue .
my roommate says he 'might have ' spilt some ribena on it .
the l1 and l2 buttons do n't seem to work .
i followed the advice here https www.reddit.com/r/ps4/comments/2qgi89/controller_only_working_on_ps_menu_but_not_in and it seems that the l1 button is stuck on while l2 just does n't register at all .
i have cleaned the buttons and surrounding areas with alcohol but could n't see any sticky residues and it has n't helped .
just wanted to know if anyone has any other advice before i have to retire this controller to the bin !
for those of you familiar with the gig-economy freelancing and microtasking it should n't take too much imagination to see how vr will make working this way more comfortable fun and convenient .
couple this with telepresence robotics you can even use vr to work as a robot in the physical world .
in short i think we are underestimating vr as a disruptive force for the very near future of work .
i think it will lead to more jobs going on-line turning more traditional jobs into gig-based jobs and it will increase our expectations of being able to contact and interact with workers and employers instantly and at all times ... and that will mean we will need flexibility .
microtasking sites like mturk and crowdflower and gig sites like fiverr are already like this .
just like on task/gig sites now that will mean more instability lower wages and a reduction in the amount of skilled labor needed .
instability for the masses lured in by the promise of no-contract labor will be here shortly .
the oculus rift the first real heavy hitter in vr is coming out in just a few months btw .
microtasking and the gig economy are already in bloom .
the demand for this kind of labor and the supply for those willing to suppy it are there .
when i studied and wrote a report on it a few years ago the industry grew 500 in one year and it continues to grow today .
yes many are behind the times on this stuff but it does n't mean it 's not going to be big soon .
vr is already functional and it provides a good experience .
it 's just currently expensive and more developers need to build apps and games for it .
have experience with crop king seeds and it was ok but selection was weak .
i know marc emery 's site is good but pretty expensive .
i looked up mjseedscanada and the selection and price seems great anyone able to provide your experience with them ?
or do you recommend another site in particular if so why ?
valus ran'aru clutches my head in his hands and hoists me overhead .
i 'd pumped four rounds into his chest from my shotgun and battered him with my fists and he 's still standing .
his grip coils like a vice and my helmet begins to buckle under the pressure .
as a last minute moment of defense i shove an arc grenade into the neck fold of his armor .
i jump into the air my fists crackling with electricity .
i hammer them down onto his head and he bursts with arcs of energy tearing him apart until he 's nothing but dust in the martian wind .
my ghost spiny and agitated as he is begins to patch my helmet before lose atmosphere .
it 's the attacks that i survive that learn the most from .
i 've been alive for a few weeks now and i 've been through what feels like a year 's worth of conflict testing my skill and whittling away weakness and rust down to the bare elements .
before all of this i was a corpse in russia .
the ghost has given me life again through the boon of the traveler who i swear to defend along with her wards .
i have to be a flash of lightning striking faster and harder than most people can formulate a thought .
be it cabal legionaries cracking apart sub-atomically after i punch them or another guardian thinking he 's the cock of the walk and needing to be taking down a peg both are the same .
i need to keep everyone on their toes and be ever-ready because even if it 's me facing them down in the crucible it 's only a matter of time before the forces of the ever-ready darkness press against our walls and attempt to usurp all we 've worked towards .
i have to be a part of the foundation of this city 's defense .
i 'll be writing a journal every now and then .
so my 5 year old league finally decided last year to get trophies for both the winner and the sacko .
there is a whole separate story but the winner did n't get the trophy until this year 's draft and now he 's arguing that he should have it for a full year and we should always present it to the new winner at the following year 's draft .
we never made an official rule for this because i think we all assumed it would n't be an issue and our league has a rule where we only change scoring rules between seasons he 's trying to invoke that to say that we ca n't change the time the trophy changes hands without a vote that would go into effect next year .
others are contending that the super bowl winner gets the lombardi trophy the day they win same with the stanley cup and same with nearly every trophy .
that we should n't need to have a rule for something so obvious .
i already know that i 'm in a league with at least one 6 year old but what do you all think ?
i was just thinking how occasionally my niece or girlfriend will watch me playing a game and how i 've recently begun streaming my gameplay but will this be impossible once i start using an hmd ?
i totally understand that vr renders things for each eye taking special lenses into effect so i completely understand the technical difficulty or perhaps sheer impossibility involved in having a standard video output running simultaneously but given how popular streaming has become it would surprise me if the only solution was requiring all spectators to have an hmd of their own .
has this topic come up before or been addressed ?
i 'm sure 5 years or so from now vr will be in a significantly more advanced place i 'm thinking of how advanced smartphones became 5 years after the original iphone for example and it might not be unusual for any dedicated gamer to have one or two headsets but it would strike me as a major handicap to not accommodate this .
i also just realized that not every headset will have the same resolution and fov correct ?
so that would be another issue if you can only have output match the exact same dimensions .
tl dr will friends be able to watch on a secondary monitor and/or will there be a solution for a streamer using vr who 's audience obviously wo n't entirely consist of fellow hmd owners ?

i understand that now they 've exhausted the state appeal process they can move on to the federal process is that right ?
and is there a process after that if they 're unsuccessful at federal level ?

sometimes they do it 's called donner syndrome ... and belive me it 's no party .
depending on how the new coach feels about tannehill i would n't be opposed to trading down to get paxton lynch .
if we decide to stick with tannehill i think our number one priority should be to improve the secondary by getting vernon hargraeves or preferably jalen ramsey .
if we decide to go with jaylon smith i say we hold off on getting a cb until 2017 as both jalen tabor from florida and corn elder from miami will be available and as both a fan of the gators and the u i can assure you that these are both very talented players .

pulled off some combos i believe i ended up with sheep and sabre tooth on board but i came up exactly 1200 lp short of game .
i had toy vendor on field and mst in hand .
i decided to give it a shot and pitch mst with toy vendor and managed to draw the single card remaining in my deck that could win bear !
d i drew into all 3 dogs early and used 2 other bears for wings combos and so that was literally the only card i could have drawn to get the damage it was pretty surreal d the luck element of vendor makes it so exciting
this was already explored with companions such as jamie and zoe but i 'm sure that the people currently behind the show could do something fresh with this dynamic .
they wanted to make the b1g east the new sec west is the reasoning i 've heard
i like niko but i fucking hate how he acts so weak and trys to play mechanically .
he always flops and flails i wish he would play with confidence because his shooting is hawt .
i do n't get why so many people say not to use a guide .
i mean i 've never used a guide for a souls game but there 's so little info in the actual games that i often end up looking up what an item does or info on the npc 's you meet to find out about them and yes that usually lands me in spoiler territory but i prefer to experience everything the game has first time around if i can .
barely anything is 'explained ' in the game so unless you love hunting down and piecing together lore i doubt there 's much to be spoiled by looking up info .
you can find the older roku 3 with no dedicated buttons my first r3 had it .
i 'm not a fan of the buttons or the entire remote because the older one had a go back '' button which was awesome .
now it has the voice search '' button which is worthless .
at least i still have the first one still in a spare bedroom .
it was capitalizing on an also visibly fading weidman 's sloppy technique .
it 's all speculation but he probably could have gotten weidman down another way .
he would't be the first staph infected fighter to win a title fight .
if one incorporated right can be taken away without due process then why not another ?
look at some of the truly bad stuff that 's gone down on reddit .
got it to log in eventually but it wo n't play any video and all the menus are in what looks like times new roman ...
edit now menus are still weird but video will play .
i tried the vittoria version but it threw off a lot of rubber bits .
you 're so backwards in your thinking its not even funny .
i bet you 've never had a so bc nobody agrees with you .
you can go on as many dates as you want .
you do n't get to assume things are exclusive just bc you 've had a couple meals with a person you fucking lunatic .
they filmed it in la around the same time as yq3 .
why do you have to wait until end of year ?
i try to re-organize my friend list whenever i do penguin scissors or seahorse cavern .
basically i look for guests with max stats use their captains and send friend requests .
i always set my most useful captains whenever i send friend requests and vast majority of times i get accepted .
then at the same time i delete friends with little activities or useless captains or those who simply ca n't keep up with my game .
thunderlord 's decree is n't especially broken on zed compared to other champions it has crazy base damage that can be proc 'd effortlessly by almost any champion .
i think they should at least make it spellcast-only instead of including autoattacks .
i agree that decks should be able to be focussed on the commander .
if your commander being taken away though shuts your entire deck down then you may want to go back to the drawing board .
there were like three or four really graphic sex scenes .
if you prime your tank correctly you will wonder why you had n't made the switch earlier .
you will honestly love the flavor of your new tank !

how would you go about the thick billowy smoke '' ?
i already have the right movement down but i ca n't seem to get away from the blurry mess .
you do n't understand how characters who are weaker without cards should be stronger with them than those who are better without cards ?
it 's entirely possible to learn modern algebra and maybe even topology before calculus .
i have mine on the deck foundation and most of the time i keep clicking open the foundation permissions menu
for your call to not be billed to you your phone company has to have some way of knowing that a certain number is toll-free and using a specific area code is the easiest option .
if they did n't use that system and instead used the actual area code it would require the maintenance of a database of toll-free numbers .
assigning them a dedicated area code or codes as multiple are now used makes identifying toll-free numbers much simpler .
the same method is used for premium-rate numbers and other examples where the type of number is more important than the geographical location .
just people get offended by all sorts of things these days .
i really do n't like this part of our growing culture of having to walk on eggshells for everyone but these are my friends and i do respect their faith .
but yeah i think it 's just a harmless piece of fiction that happens to use jesus in the plot and treats him respectfully .
do you also take thyroid medication or have you had the full battery of thyroid tests ?
you certainly do n't look hypothyroid in your picture .
i was answering in the context of the question asked and not in the context of being clear to those that do not read the question .
the formula goes like this sigma is uncertainty mu 3 sigma mmr '' .
at default values it looks like 25 3 8.333 0.001 '' .
at default mu but a minimum capped sigma 25 3 2.5 17.5 '' .
notice how mmr in the second example 17.5 is much higher than it is in the first one 0.001 .
the uncertainty does n't match you against random opponents .
i do n't think jericho will be at wm xxx i think he will know when it is time to step out and wo n't have an ego keeping him there .
unless he does n't actually get worse over time ...
this is jericho 's exact attitude whenever people ask him about retirement .
but as his match with neville proved he can still go with the right opponent .
but think about it this way a bunch of intelligent characters paired with realistic events do n't make for an interesting story for very long .
it 's been done before but it 's a very difficult thing to do .
i quit playing and sulk if the group decides to switch maps .
... this is almost verbatim what i have said for decades now ...
that 's true although leffen seems like he psychs himself out sometimes .
i 'm convinced the samus mu problem he has is just mental and he puts himself on tilt .
or born into an unfavorable circumstance and too dirt poor to move elsewhere most likely because their parents were poor .
it 's a vicious cycle do n't blame those caught in it .
the 3do is pretty simple to take apart just google it .
i recently did mine to find why it died .
most of the time it is the grease drying up or the gear to move the laser has a crack .
my issue was the gear but i ca n't seem to find one .
i 'm going to attempt to 3d print one .
if yours is that issues pm me and i 'll keep you in mind if i get around to making the gear .
i think you could still make sure you consistently have swamps available if you play cards like knight of the white orchid and sword of the animist .
if you do n't have access to any of those cards or other options i did n't list i 'd probably slant the deck to be a bit more black than white for now and make it at the very least half black .
what would convince me of the positive existence of god ?
a falsifiable miracle which was n't able to be explained by any measure of science .
the absorption is in theory 40-60 of an equivalent injection dose .
there is some doubt as to whether sublingual is an effective method at all but i 'm giving it a try .
there are others on this sub making legal assertions with no legal authority provided to back their claims .
because rengars jump is an auto attacks and kha is a ability
can you use a knife as a weapon yet ?
been playing since alpha kickstarter backer and it seemed counter-intuitive to not be able to use a knife to stave off the wolf attacks .
so the filtering of the eyes is part of the joke ?
itao was always was a bit more awkward with his humor .
i usually do n't understand him because of that .
i just know he makes the whole area feel uncomfortable like no one knows how to react to him or what he 's getting at .
the hard to understand part is itao 's jokes like a little too smart for me .
are they usually hard to understand or am i just experiencing the culture gap ?
search the city is at 300 for moderately played .
ever since the unique card limit was raised to 200 it really took off
it 's time for them to dance with the angels ! i 'm sorry .
last i knew he was cleaning and getting ready to start making juices .
he 's probably getting super organized and planning everything out .
i use it as my alarm tone it has a haunting quality to it that i have n't gotten tired of .
given that it 's supposed to be a very short term issue i do n't understand why borrowing it through conventional methods either by paying with credit or getting a separate small loan would not be viable options .
obviously nobody likes to take on debt but most people have to do it in order to pay for school so it seems pretty inappropriate to ask others to pay for her schooling in this case .
maybe op really does have some good reason why the crowd-funding is so necessary but he has n't given anywhere near enough details to justify it in my opinion .

after the first ww2 when communism was in its heyday i bet you there were people like you believing that the evil red will prevail .
actual countries with massive armies nuclear weapons what have you .
you should be more realistic and less of a coward .
bulls are n't to shabby and the cubs are going to win it all within the next three years .
not much to fret about except well the bears ...
the experience led to him leaving the communist party and working actively to free the ussr .
i 'm just saying it 's dumb to use completion percentage as a stat when that 's what half of your passes were .
i remember op 's bike from the other day on another thread .
i am such an amateur that i do n't really feel comfortable saying too much negative about a picture

holy baby buddah in a basket wtf is this woman 's deal .
my dad always thought that i just went through an emo phase as a young teen .
he does n't realize that i still want to cut when life gets hard that i 've been hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and that i still need counseling .
he also does n't realize that i exhibited symptoms of depression as a child which i could n't really verbalize at the time because i had n't heard of depression or mental illness before .
my neighborhood had so many firecrackers going off early in the evening that we had to shut the windows so our kids could hear the movie they were watching .
at one point it sounded like they had a string going around the street that passes by our house .
we went out to watch the fireworks a few times .
it was so much cooler than when we lived in the airport area !
i 'm generally pretty good with money so all of the games i bought this year were either great games or at least good at reduced price
i actually stumbled upon the crucifixion scene right after i listened to my first song by them .

thought you were op and was trying to figure out how you finished 25 episodes in 3 hours .
i 'm going to have to agree and disagree with you .
i say smurves and i say milves because of wolves and the elves .
my book from the local library is an old one that 's why it has a section on it .
measure drum face to deck and the adjust the blades .
it can also kick ass as a sword but the bow can deal so much damage .
i use the sword to create space in pvp then use the bow to follow up .
tear the bear 's intestines out and eat it like a gogurt on the ride home .
morgana 's target still takes damage from things and the shield can be easily bursted .
i do n't think tahm counts as a commitment because he literally presses w saves them puts them out after cds are down and they shred people .
all the little tube thing with the 2 tiny wires sticking out the end are relays .
the 2 small wires sticking out the ends are the coil of the relay .
it is very difficult to tell what is going on but from the looks of things i would venture to say that it is not safe .
at a minimum it should all be enclosed with a cover and no exposed wire nuts or exposed individual wires .
unfortunately i ca n't tell from the photo the voltage of the control wiring .
the small wires connected to the relays if that is more than 30 volts it should n't be on that small wiring run throughout your home .
do you light switches have that tiny wiring hooked to them ?
this is type of panel is typically used to control lighting
actually no because they drop down from a ledge above all at the same time .
have you even played that part of the game ?
congress defines mass shootings as those involving 3 or more deaths ...
as stated before one more bottle is an exception for me when it comes to that genre of their songs .
it 's just got some type of perfection to it .
my favorite creamy banana flavor is without a doubt has to be nana custard '' by tbd liquids !
if you like those type of flavors you really owe it to yourself to give it a shot .
my first accident i got t-boned and flipped upside down and when i crawled out the first thing i made sure was that nobody was hurt because it was in a neighborhood and i saw a lot of people around .
everything turns itself off permanently if you wash it long and deep enough .
maybe her parents should have tried it with her .
gravis marketing has c rating so do n't take it seriously .
btw we can take nevada ... in 2008 obama won nevada even though he lost popular vote by 5 points losing 38 points among latinos .
we are doing better compared to obama among latinos 10-15 points behind
winning nevada will destroy the bernie won iowa and nh because of white progressives '' narrative .
so even we lose south carolina we can enter super tuesday head to head
i had never conosdered that resoultion tip thanks a lot !
also i fully understand that because this game is in alpha that things could change drastically changing performance which was why i decided to ask here because others have more experience with alpha games than myself .
thanks a lot for your reply and i will gladly bump down my resolution if it means a big performance boost .
the four days thing is n't working for me .
there 's no guarantee they wo n't experience it again .
i had an aunt and uncle who broke up after 50 years .
i know 2 people who have had children die .
actually far more than that i suppose since i work with the elderly .
there was one woman who thought the sun rose and set on her son .
he died of a heart attack during her convalescence .
there 's no end to grief i hate to say .
in fact from what i can see it comes faster and faster as you age .
i really like this watch but i 'm currently torn between this or a pelagos for my next buy .
i love the fact that this is the first in-house movement and i do n't think you can get a power reserve at this price anywhere else but i also really love the pelagos .
tudor has added the whole pelagos chronometer officially certified '' and i think it makes the face too busy now .
i get that it is now impressive that it 's officially certified but i think it could be written on the back and the face could be kept more simple .
president barack obama opened the new year by touting the accomplishments of his presidency

i 'd first have to say i have no idea how to fix it .
but since you asked i have a couple ideas .
first bring back middle-class blue-collar jobs back to baltimore .
a little stability goes a long way for a family .
start a serious mentoring program/after school programs for kids .
every single school should have free before and aftercare for kids .
yeah it 's expensive and yeah it 'll be abused but i 'd rather have kids with a responsible adult doing a productive activity music art sports technology scouts etc than going home to the hood with an empty fridge and no parent around .
maybe have students from the local hbc morgan state in baltimore for example do internship hours there so kids see educated responsible young black adults .
give families the option for free public boarding school .
schools like seed all boys boarding school fill up super fast every year and the kids there usually do really well .
fix dilapidated houses clean up the neighborhood volunteer in a soup kitchen .
finally acknowledge the fact that it 'll take years maybe a couple generations to make some headway on the problem .
it 's going to take lots of politicians passing the torch and keeping the course to continue .
unfortunately our political system is n't set up to really help a long-term systemic problem that needs so much more than a quick fix .
i 've never been on a date with anyone who had ever heard of it .
it 's not spectacularly well known amongst 20-something women especially since it went off the air 16 years ago .
mind chiming in some advice for a recent bsc .
nearing 4 months and i still have n't had much luck other than a few interviews .
during my ug i volunteered a lot in academic labs and did a capstone project but other than that i do n't have experience outside of academia .
so on my related experience '' section of my resume i 've just ordered those chronologically .
as for actual paid work i 've done a lot of self-employed it work and private tutoring but that 's not really relevant to analytical chemistry so i 've always listed that at the bottom of the section even though they 're my most recent jobs that actually paid money .
i have tried networking contacting my peers and mentors from ug but no luck for any entry-level jobs .
all of the listings in my city toronto all have masters or phd listed as a requirement .
at this point i 've ended up volunteering back in my lab where i did my ug capstone project and i 've been mostly subsisting on my it work to put me through living .
it does n't really matter what kind of difficulty you call it .
do you think the m3 could handle everything i 'm asking for ?
london 's 4,000 boris bikes cost taxpayers ¬£1,400 for each bicycle every year despite sponsorship from barclays bankwankers
fe has learnt that the operators are going to oppose any such move in their responses to the consultation paper on the subject the last date for which has now been extended till january 7 by the telecom regulatory authority of india .
the other aspect which the operators are going to highlight is that differential data tariff is allowed in several other countries like singapore malaysia hong kong bangladesh and thailand .
in fact singapores largest mobile operator singtel offers a data package for facebook which does not allow voice and video calling .
the second model proposes that content providers reimburse the cost of browsing or download to the customers directly irrespective of which mobile operator they have used to visit the website .
in response to these two models suggested by the regulator the industry is going to say that one where content providers directly reimburse the consumers for visiting their site only helps those who are connected it does not bring the unconnected on to the net .

on the bright side we still get to say we 're undefeated in bcs games since they dissolved the system .
would n't it seem more likely that they planted the key knowing the police would eventually come and search the compound again ?
possibly ... . but because manitowoc sherrif 's dept officers could n't keep their big nose out of things despite calumet county 's assurances that they would not be a part of it other than to lend physical resources suspicion will always fall on colburn and lenk .
there 's a list of reasons that you can choose for the return .
if you end up choosing a reason that 's due to preference then they 'll give you a return label at their reduced rate but it will come out of the total amount that is credited to you .
i straight up struggle with my brows they 're two totally opposite shapes like one is totally straight and the other has an arch and on top of that the straight one is physically lower .

as others have said you need to request to open a new account and either close the old account or remove yourself as joint on that account if possible .
some credit unions will allow you to just remove yourself as long as the balance is not negative .
in the future remember that when you add someone as a joint account holder you also provide them with authorization to access your money and treat it as their own .
if they want to withdraw your money they can .
if they want to spend it elsewhere they can .
that life when you were 5 points from the gi unit made me sad though .

thanks for the suggestion could be an interesting way of showing a very different take on video games !
people ca n't seem to accept there are some unknowns in a story and force their own bullshit into the gap
also they should have mandatory free classes on money management when they accept the load
a bit unrelated but i believe the rams do that as well with all their draft picks .
very smart move if you ask me more teams should do that .
i like bill burr but his comedy is shitty about women .
according to kourinn 's testing they already doubled tank aggro generation .
if they want warrior and berserker tanks to be viable they need to let them do brawler and post-buff lancer tier damage .

i think that anohana was fine up until the last episode .

i mean with the low bar of the prequels i 'd say there are several better scenes than that .
hell the entire first act of revenge of the sith minus the puke-inducing padme-anakin scenes are a crapton better .
people who defend the prequels these days were probably five during the films ' release and probably have n't seen them recently .
whether you turn off your brain to enjoy the pretty lightshow or you laugh ironically at all the bad acting cinematography and cgi it 's just hard to get into .
the most positive comment i can make is that phantom menace is the least obnoxious of the three .
yes despite all the jar-jar and jake lloyd 's wooden acting .
also you 're comparing one intentionally whiny scene with three entire films ' worth of bad acting .
i 've seen internships that will put you up for a clearance .
basically the offer of the internship is dependent on the interim clearance coming through in time instead of being conditional on your final clearance coming through if you 're lucky the place will try to find something unclassified for you to do instead if the interim does n't come through .
if you 've ever wonder about all that jobs that wo n't hire you unless you already have a clearance ... well this is what enables that to be a realistic hiring requirement .
they expect people to get clearances doing internships while they 're in school .
and the feds do not care about state laws about pot for purposes of clearances .
their stance has been to dig in their heels and just insist that it 's illegal and it does n't matter what the states say .
an individual investigator and/or adjudicator might take it into consideration when deciding whether your past marijuana use is an issue but i would n't go into the process depending on it was legal in the state i smoked it in '' to get you your clearance .
google trends is based on search data and that 's what pypl uses see their faq http pypl.github.io/pypl.html accordion on the bottom of the page .
i think stackoverflow is probably a little more general since people might ask questions and answer based on knowledge of private projects .
in both cases you probably need to consider the history of the site too github was written in ruby and had a lot of early ruby users stackoverflow was written in c and had a lot of early c users i 'd take numbers for those languages in their respective strongholds with a grain of salt .

cronk at dragons with widdop would be cool but i think it does n't help anyone that much other than some wins
but stand alone ones i get really bored with a 20 part series .
the only one i have enjoyed of late is the one about the problem patient joe .
i did n't have an initial attraction to her at first .
my first impression of her was that she was rather loud and kind of a bitch .
she was very secretive about herself and then one day she opened up just a tiny bit to me .
i was only trying to make small talk and she deflected everything .
i 'm not sure if i felt bad for her or what since it was a personal matter that i guess would n't come up in regular conversation .
i just wanted to know her a little bit .
eventually we were on the topic of her hair and she showed me a picture of her with long hair and crushing away .
it 's weird because i had no crush at all then she tells me one tiny thing shows me a picture and i want to take her out for a drink .
i do n't know a lot about her but i really would love to know more or at the very least get to know her better .
i invite her out to things we do with friends from work so she does n't get overwhelmed one on one with me but she always declines .
there are tons of caf√©s in my country where people can drink 10 glasses of real beer like this http www.trollekelder.be/cafe/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/duvel.jpg .
i once knew of a guy who drank 15 of those beers after work daily .
anyway like most discussions the thing you 're discussing really depends on numerous things..
true reset removes everything exceptions murder run complete reset took place door in snowdin opened .
if your game had crashed in a way that screwed anything up flowey would n't have made that comment .
the driver in front of cammer was also camping the left lane
in my country if i stay in the right lane and i 'm going faster than a camper in the passing lane i can drive by him/her its legal .
it has risen on hype and increased demand so it will tail off and the price will decrease as investors start selling off at increased price which dumps extra supply on the market .
trusting companies to do the right thing isnt always a good idea .
it 's also a testament of how easy of a fortnight perona really is
i did n't know him but we had mutual friends .
it has n't been in the news as far as i know .
i found out about it through the gofundme page and through the mutual friends .
i know the place he was at it was n't dodgy at all mostly outdoor seating etc .
this is so hilarious.. cats always have the look that says i 'm in control of this .
1sec is definitely too short to acquire the nebulosities regardless of the iso settings you just do n't capture much photons
'for science ' i 've just processed a single 600sec f/5.6 800 iso sub i had on hand http i.imgur.com/61dv7bv.jpg
without surprise this gives much more details as well as much more noise than a huge series of short lights .
what you might try is finding a sweet spot where your stars just start trailing a bit and see how much additional data it 'll bring .

i achieved 2015 that i 've developed my music production skills .
i am also pretty happy with my new songs because i became a lot better in composing as well .
for 2016 i hope to get some listeners for my music .
i also want to improve my production skills in the last year i was happy after finishing a track and so i put it online .
after one week or so i took it offline because i was unhappy with it that 's why i 've finished only a small number of tracks .
i also want to improve my constancy related to producing music .
i have phases where i get so much done and then i have phases where i push random buttons and only crap comes out .
i 'm excited to drop pandora one after years and years of paying for it as you make spotify sound so much better !
i do know that kishi does n't rule over everything naruto with an iron fist and that he had a publisher though i did not know their name .
but he is still the original holder of the ip although it is probably shared with shueisha .
nevertheless the original holder of the ip often gets the last say in a matter if it is required .
but with an ip as big as naruto kishi problably has a few people he has absolute faith in to handle these things .
if publishers go against the original authors work they can sue them for desecrating/detroying/misrepresenting it .
hahahaha the entire last 20 minutes of the movies is hill on a major trip before he get dethroned
i am clearly here because either i do n't know what to do or i do and i ca n't bring myself to do it .
making me look forward even more to the next v40 .
i happen to think that unless the motors are bad or critical parts mechanically damaged it is not worth returning and all the hassle when there are lots of reasons to tear it down and fix some stuff anyway .
he 's a tall white guy who kind of shoot the only thing sets him apart is that he 's reasonably athletic tall white guy .
it 's a gamble to trade him and it 's a gamble to not to trade him .
personally i do n't ever see him becoming the next nowitzki or sabonis .
i see him being what everyone thought jan vesely could of been .
i hate kids or anyone for that matter that torment animals .
he will still have euro truck sim 2 jc3 and there are also singleplayer games coming out .
dude if i uploaded my body cam shit to google i would be so fucked .

it 's a little odd that the host did n't open that shortcut though do n't you think ?

these cities have experienced a tremendous decrease in their populations .

this year he got on roids and started shaving his body for the ladies .
this is a tad off topic because it 's not her but her beautiful jaw line and luscious lips remind me of another one heidi waters .
even if she 's not similar i still figure you 'd appreciate her ability to deep throat .
we use wristbands and only allow brothers to give 2 or 3 of them to guests
if you report it the odds are that you will have to testify .
he will lose his job and there is a good chance he will end up with prison time .
there is definitely a chance that he will try to do this to another young girl maybe he already has or is in the process of doing it right now i do n't know and it 's not my place to accuse him .
i 'm not going to try to tell you what to do you are in a very difficult situation .
i think that what he did should be reported though .
he was in a position of trust and he betrayed that with someone who was far too young which was illegal .
i hope that whatever decision you make it 's the best for you and your future/conscience .
yeah i absolutely do n't want to lose the feeling i have .

does n't necessarily have to be done on a schedule then .
you know why should i or any other citizen of this great country be forced to watch babies feeding in public ?
and when i say that i emphasize that it 's not about the feeding itself but the manner in which it is done .
breastfeeding in general does n't bother me at all i consider it quite normal .
however breastfeeding in public infuriates me because it means women have to bear their chest and nipples to do it and that causes a distraction and sets a bad example for people and especially small children .
we ca n't have that we just ca n't the new hampshire rep. said .
he added see the equivalent of that would be if every single man who is sexually aroused by a female walking by would be allowed to take his pants and underwear off and show his erection to his potential mate .
imagine hordes of men in the streets getting naked and walking around with erections exposing themselves to small children .
we have a name for people who do those things and it 's sexual predators .
we put people in jail for doing that for christ 's sake.
because waving an erect penis in a mating display is exactly the same as feeding a baby .

woke up this morning to see this http imgur.com/riyw9ch shared by nmom who i went to minimal contact with about 6 months ago .
i do n't know what possessed me to stay friends with her on fb but waking up to that made me so angry .
i tried to go completely no contact when my sister became very mentally ill and nmom would show up at my job unannounced drive over to my house and walk in etc .
to see her saying that this is ok just really made me want to comment about what a joke it is so her little cult of followers can see how messed up she is .
as a virtuous wife does it include tolerating his cousin enduring his concubines bearing his mother ?
if you will not let me live freely why would i let you live in satisfaction ?
did fate let women time-travel so she could learn the three morals and four virtues ?

how easy is it to sell one of these ?

perhaps you can help me with my german as well d. i love table top games card games science books history and music but like to talk about any and everything .
i am a huge tom boy and hippy and have wanted dreads all my life .
my dream would be to grow my dreads past my butt .
loving the process but feeling very lost and uncertain about how they will turn out .
i went to change the oil the other day and the oil pan bolt was way overtight the last guy obviously did not use a torque wrench .
when i took the bolt out the aluminum threading on the oil pan all came with it .
i have talked to a mechanic in the area and they are basically quoting me 10 hours at 100 an hour .
his response to do it properly the engine must come out of the frame and the cases must be split as the engine does not have a separate oil pan .
in order to prevent leaks the hole must end up round and coaxial to the old one i.e normal to the sealing surface .
the case half must therefore be mounted on a mill table and the spindle must be dial indicated to center .
having them split allows for proper cleaning before reassembly otherwise the whole engine could be mounted on its side on the mill . ''
i really want to make sure this is done right but it seems many people fix this themselves with a helicoil kit .
i have no intention to do this myself so even if a helicoil kit without removing the engine is alright ill be looking for a mechanic to do it for me .
edit bad title the pan is stripped not the bolt .
i am building an arcane archer and want to make her acid arrows do more damage .
i have one piece of equipment that add 43 to acid spells and my arrows are indeed doing more damage .
however can i put another piece of equipment on that adds 30 and will it add up to 73 or will only the 43 be applicable like other equipment bonuses ?
so i recently started a new youtube channel and this was the only youtube seo guide i found which was a bit related to music

i will be at fubar airsoft in taunton mass if you want to pick up today only .
i will be there until around 4 or 5 i think prices negotiable and less because no shipping in person .
i 'd really prefer cash for these as i have two rifles that see limited use as it is .
feel free to offer a different price than listed only trade i 'd seriously consider would be a vfc scar-h .
i personally took it down cleaned it adjusted motor height and shimmed it .
there 's some little white spots on the right side of the rifle nothing serious just a little blemish .
i can take pictures if anyone wants it 's not super noticeable .
the battery died while i was away somehow but i can include one of my batteries i use for my other primaries for 20 basically i do n't want to include a battery but if you need one ...
this was acquired in a trade for my kwa mkii never really used it .
i loaned it to a friend for one day of gaming he loved it .
i do n't like the magazines and it i did n't spend anytime upgrading it beyond cleaning it up .
just looking to get rid of it because it caters more to beginners and this is a good beginner package .
if you want a battery they are easy to grab off of hobbyking.com along with a charger .
the price of the gun new but you get 4 mags a triple mag pouch and free shipping .
three non-leaky non-jamming magazines included worth their weight in gold haha
one non leaky non jamming magazine with a follower that wo n't lock down just a little harder to load
triple mag pouch custom tailored by your truly described below
it 's a great little smg scares the shit out of some people in cqb .
it shoots great a little hard at around 335ish fps with .25 's .
the cqb bolt or dangerwerx valve can bring that down though .
of course the rof is menacing and the slight recoil is much more interesting than an aeg .
i am asking 280 and we 'll discuss shipping .
all the links are the same besides the shooting videos .
i 'm also a nice person so i think my post is ok .
i sometimes love crap games and try to play them .
after some test-videos we 've decided to make a bit of a series of our funny lol-moments to share with you guys d it 's in dutch tho so you can watch it if you 're not from holland but i doubt you 'll understand.. h√®h√® .
is it just me or should blizz make something similar to the masterpiece brd ?
im not saying it should look the same but it should be equally as large not going in a straight line like all the dungeons today .
i miss the feeling of adventure when you wasnt really sure what was behind the next corner a dungeon so huge it had 15 bosses however there should be one last boss but you should be able to choose what route you want to take to get to it .
and also they sould make it so that there is atleast one boss like gahz'rilla from zul'farrak im not saying it should be a large hydra but you would have to do a quest to get an item to summon it like u used to there are to few of these encounters these days blizz often removes the old attunes and required items to summon bosses .
soundcloud removed my mixes youtube muted it despite all tracks being free most of which were remixes .
i just resumed a game in which i had spent a good deal of time melting snow/boiling water and repairing clothes assuming that maybe just maybe exiting a building would trigger a save like it does in a lot of other games .
i come back and the save was well before that and now i have to redo all that mess .
and perhaps a suggestion could we please get a save game '' button so we 're not left in the long dark ?
i 'm a 21m and she is a 20f both of us in third year of university .
we have met a few times through a mutual friend but we were both drunk each time and i do n't really remember much about the interactions .
near the end of this past term i texted her asking if she wanted to go out before the term ended .
she said although she would love too she had too much work to do with finals coming up and said we should postpone till the start of next term .
we live about 20min away back home near a major city so i was thinking about seeing if she would want to go out before heading back for second term .
should i do this or just wait until we get back to school ?
i 'm looking at new cars/cpos and love the tts .
i 've been on the fence about a cpo m3 vs waiting for the m2 vs getting a 2015 tts as the 0-60 and interior are really what i 'm looking for not so much a track car .
while it already has brilliant performance i 've tinkered with the thought of using a unitronic ecu to increase it slightly would probably only shoot for stage 1 .
i however have not been able to find any literature about this modification voiding the factory/cpo warranty .
my clan today was raided while most of the members were offline .
we had a massive compound with three or four serious loot rooms with airlock doors and trapdoors everywhere about seven armored rooms leading to the room with three concrete high walls around them a sniper tower and two high outer walls .
granted the opponent had like 60 c4 normal server no exaggeration but still there are a few designs we did n't try .
we have n't built them but i think we should this next base .
what are some of the best base designs you 've seen ?
how likely is it for a clan to make 60 or 80 c4 plus like 120 rockets in a month cycle server without it being cheating or duping ?
yo i 'm level 65 and i 'm having a bit of trouble with the living failures on my eileen build if someone could help that 'd be cool
i 've been trying to play on multiple servers tonight and whenever a server gets near full capacity it will begin to lag then crash .
players fill a new server and the process repeats .
tl dr heater core in truck went bad can not afford a new one yet .
will the 350 watts be enough to make the resisitor heater coil sufficiently warm the inside of the vehicle ?
edit 1 i was given the 350 watt inverter by a friend of mine and it would be more cost effective to just buy a new heater core for my truck than to buy a bigger inverter lol

i 've been playing legends of the jedi lately and i was wondering if there are any other muds like this with a healthy mix of roleplaying and mechanics ?
mechanics for when there 's no one about and you just want to play and roleplaying for the rest of the time pretty much .
the only ones i really know of are the iron realms muds and i 'm not interested in them for obvious reasons .
hi all just a question about the 1.3 update .
the last time i played terraria was in 2011 which i spent 92 hours on making my own base etc .
with the introduction of the newer biomes i do n't think they 've been generated on my map my map is small world i believe .
do i have to generate a new world to experience these things or have i just not looked hard enough ?
edit cut my base into a 1.3 map pretty much seamlessly using tedit .
my brother let me borrow his ps4 over the weekend and i 've been playing tons of zombies .

i see there 's 2 cylinders on either side of the window and a latch in the middle .
however i cant figure out how i can open it..
video of issue can be found here https youtu.be/so3_zaryyy8 ? t=1m18s .
that 's due to youtube compression as it was not doing that while capturing .
basically my character is staring at the joystick when in normal flight mode .
when the home key is pushed to switch hud views he finally looks up in the proper area but of course i 'm unable to fly at that point .
user folder is n't a problem as i uninstalled and deleted everything before downloading and installing the newest version of sc .
this issue occurs with any ship i have in my hangar .
also i tried again tonight to make the sure the issue was consistent .
also worth noting while in free look mode it constantly directs me to look down when i stop moving the sights with my cursor much like a joystick is being held down on a controller .
anyone else experiencing this or have any ideas on how i might go about solving this ?
also my video shows other bugs menu selection being a pain rented or purchased items not showing up at all etc .
this post is mainly about my hud issue as it prevents me from being able to fly period .
hey bf3 looking for someone with a mic to play with on xbox 360 .
i would love to get a good squad going .
if you can summon your weapon to you that 's cool .
having it appear out of thing air is cool but even cooler is if it flies to your hand like mjolnir or a lightsaber .
not looking at the weapon while it flies to your hand is max coolness .
big jumps are very cool in fact big jumping is definitely cooler than flying .
even internal stuff like a missing heart is cool especially if any of that stuff is replaced by something else cool like a hook laser or arc reactor .
though bonus points are definitely given for bad asses that fight you with only one arm .
very cool characters acknowledge the coolness of others and give credit where credit is due .
stuff like i guess that was okay i could do it better '' is lame .
grappling huge haymakers and smashing enemies with whatever is laying around are all cooler than kung fu .
kung fu is cool in exactly one scenario and that 's where your opponent is also using it and you 're better .
if your opponent is not also a kung fu warrior fighting that opponent with kung fu is lame .
if you 're unfamiliar with this concept just watch mulan .
kneeling before your king if the king is a good dude and not a bad guy is cooler than trying to be all tough and saying i do n't kneel before no one ! ''
doing the same tired old stuff is not cool but doing stupid weird stuff just for the sake of not doing the same tired old stuff is also not cool .
example you want to be a ranger with an animal companion .
everyone does wolf so that 's not that cool .
but saying since everyone does wolf i 'm going to do llama ! ''
a grizzled old mastiff or burly warthog is cooler .
moving stuff with your mind or powers is just so awesome .

i am working on an original score for a friend 's short film and i noticed something weird about fruity video player .
some background i 've written orchestral pieces before and i have a lot of experience with fl but this is my first time doing a score .
the problem i notice is that the position '' time value which is displayed by the video player plugin is consistently about 2 seconds behind the playlist time .
for the final result it does n't matter if everything sounds and looks right in fl i need to bounce to mp3 and it needs to sync with the video in final cut .
i 'd be grateful for any advice or explanation .
so as the title says i 'm a sophomore and i have n't been in a relationship in 2 years .
around this time last year i introduced myself to a very quiet and calm girl who 's around my age .
we started off as friends and we continually got closer and closer to each other throughout the year .
over the summer i joined my school 's marching band she was already in it but never went to the band camp so it was both of our first times .
we got closer again but still never felt any attraction to her .
around the end of september our band went to our state fair and on the walk back to our bus i suddenly realized i had feelings for her .
she felt like the perfect person to me everything we did together felt more and more special .
i felt like i found the one but i 've told no one about my feelings about her and it gets increasing hard as whenever we have a person to person conversation people think it 's hilarious to butt in and try to set me up with her and create an awkward situation between us .

so there 's been theories going around that chara narrates the game and joins frisk as frisk falls onto the golden flowers at the start of the game .
using my newfound realization i can confirm this with one hundred percent certainty .
as evidenced in the genocide route and by toby himself chara is the embodiment of the player 's actions .
you do n't remember anything happening before frisk fell here .
you do however know of the intro cutscene and chara falling into the underground .
as you observe the game and take in the events of it that 's them .
you are n't frisk but that does n't change your control over them .
much like people theorize that chara has possessed or followed frisk from the start of the game and helped them through it .
tl dr chara is you you control frisk chara controls frisk
as a person who actively plays team builder i recently decided to use the normal queue because i didnt have a lot of time to wait .
the amount of pure hate people were vomiting at each other was insane .
the 4 wannabe mid laners were at each other 's throats from champ select wishing horrible things to each other .
one trolls the other one rages in chat and the third one stops giving a damn '' and joins the other troll .
10 minutes into the game they are racing each other to get the enemy mid laner as fed as possible while spaming all chat to report our own team for being noob '' .
at that moment i was reminded why i chose the team builder life .
i prefer to wait 10 min in queue instead of spending 20 or 30 min in a game infested by hate and frustration .
just make team builder the only way to join normal games to reduce the wait time .
the two queue options honestly feels like a completely different game .

so maybe we should look at the other batman related things like the detective comic on page 9. just suggesting things here .

but the batman logo on holly 's chest and the detective comic on page 9 are still batman related
earlier this month where a group of friends took me to an amazing club/brothel in mexico .
there is a strip club on the first floor and a hotel on top that charges by the half hour .
you just pointed upstairs and showed them the money and they either followed or denied most just follow .
my friends slept with a few girls but i could n't do it .
just hours before i was with a ton of family some of which are young kids .
and the thought of having sex with someone who did n't give two fucks about me and just cared for the money i was giving them for 30 mins of access to their vagina seemed like a creepy and sleazy way of losing my virginity even though i do n't think that for other people doing it .
i could have had multiple curvy women at once and even though i enjoy porn at times it just felt off for me .
these were real people who might be doing this just because they were poor or have a bad situation at home .
but here 's the thing i 'm incredibly liberal and secular .
i do n't believe in abstinence and probably not even romantic love .
i am not against prostitution if its regulated correctly .
but a feeling deep down inside me prevented me from doing it even though there would have been no consequences .
anyway i do n't know if anyone has ever felt the same way .
if the thought of feeling sleazy or thoughts about your family 's judgement if they were in the same room ever prevented you from doing something that you otherwise morally agree with ...
i left his violent alcoholic father when i was 7 months pregnant and he has seen him twice .
i have remarried since and my husband adopted my son .
he drinks now with his friends nothing excessive generally twice a week he will have a pint or two of lager and a vodka shot .
he 's in college and is a good kid .
he has never shown any inclination of violence or aggression towards me or anyone else .
but smelling beer on him when he comes home brings back memories of life living with a drinker and i worry that he may become an out of control drinker .
but i 'm unsure whether this is my own paranoia surely he could n't follow behaviour patterns of a man he has seen twice in his life ?
currently i 'm selling the following pins i 'm always trying to restock so if i 'm missing a pin ur looking for check later or add me because i might get my hands on it sooner or later
i have sold so far over 30 pins without any complaints whatsoever .
my reputation is built legit every rep i have has a trade behind it no fake reps whatsoever .
steam level 82 and growing i say it 's a big matter no sane guy would invest so much in something you can not profit from and then attempt to scam .
i can provide full proof on skype live stream pictures of the pin with our conversation on the background
i`m usually up for around 18-20h so you will mostlikely get an instant response from me .
what i will not be able to do for you !
i will never go first in all of my previous sales i 've never went first .
i will not scratch the code untill the items/keys are in my inventory .
i will mostlikely try avoiding trades on tuesdays i 've had issues in the past because of the weekly maintenance and inventory are on slow mode during that time .
i will not give you the physical pin you are paying only for the in-game pin .
a i find my prices fair for several reasons actually i 've sold pins on a regular basis without any complaints .
i always have a fairly decent stock of pins since i`m also reselling .
my profile and the proof i provided on my previous trades were more than enough to seal the deal .
a friends that were with me at dhcn that do n't have the reputation and time i do gave me their pins .
q and how do you know the codes are good ?
a they are unscratched and i was personally with them when they bought them .
a if your code does n't work i either messed up a letter like o and 0 or your full of bs and activated on another account .
i will recheck the code several times to be sure i typed it well if i did then you activated it on another account .
rarely there are some steam issues such as low inventory load and that might be the issue but the code will work you just wo n't see the item in your inventory untill they resolve the issue .
a for payments in skins i require a 30 overpay in good marketable items i will not bother taking skins that are hard to trade .
a for one reason i do n't need one i 'm doing all of my sales on opskins https opsk.in/u/l86ax .
i would like to build my dad a new computer .
he mainly uses his computer for hd videos youtube facebook e-mail etc .
will he need a graphics card for hd video ?

i 've never watched star trek until recently truthfully never liked it but i realized i was drawing a blank on a huge chunk of pop culture that is basically in every tv show today .
so i want to at least try and get into it at least for the sake of general knowledge .
however i know the star trek mythology is way too complex to just get into it so i 've come here to see the experts .
would anyone care to compile a list of star trek episodes no matter which series that would work as a good intro to the star trek world ?
i asked my trekkie friend to give me a sample of the show s and he suggested
i 've watched them still not really my cup of tea but i still think i do n't have a grasp of what it is i 'm watching if that makes sense so basically i 'm looking for a more comprehensive list of episodes as an intro to star trek .

this is one of many stories i will be forcing myself to relive for the sake of reddit .
the last eleven months of my life soon to be a year have been fairly miserable .
the one i 'll be telling you happened last night .
this ... event ... is the reason i am deciding to share this with you all .
this was the second semester of my first year of college .
things were going great grades were good this girl and i were getting serious .
i 've only had sleeping problems at one other point in my life .
i starting taking melatonin 2 weeks after it started and for the next six months .
when i stopped taking the melatonin they did n't start again .
at the beginning i started waking up during the night .
until now the generally small amount i slept as a pre-med college student was fairly low .
honestly not much of that was due to the courses i was taking gen chem 1 and basic biology and calculus were n't too big of deals .
i played video games drank beers or generally bullshitted for a large amount of most nights .
but i slept consistently for the time i did procure some shut-eye .
anyways i was waking up most nights for some reason .
honestly waking up was as inconsistent in timing as could be .
some nights an hour before i needed to wake up for class other nights at 1 am or anywhere in between .
i tried taking melatonin again thinking things like this are probably cyclical .
i gave up after three weeks and resigned myself to restless nights and tired days .
i started skipping the classes i was n't before .
thanks high school chemistry for chem 1 and 2 !
thing was now i was missing the important classes .
my grades stayed about the same but my social activity decreased dramatically .
i did n't stop seeing my friends just only hung out with the ones i actually liked .
it was college i had a lot of friends from the floor class and social events .
i only hung out with the ones i was closest to for the entirety of the second semester .
honestly this change increased my happiness by a lot and i 'm not sure if it 's even related to the insomnia .
but i figured it might be relevant and that is why i 'm sharing it with you .
the point of this background is to help you understand how things started .
now i 'm going to tell you the last result of my chronic insomnia .
typically a particular group of friends and i headed downstate to one friend 's farmhouse .
we were staying local at one of the other friend 's house who has been a friend of mine since childhood .
there were less than usual this year due to the relocation and last minute planning .
six of us staying up til 4 getting pretty hammered and abusing a go-cart too small for any of us .
since the beds were taken up in the house by my buddy his mother and a lady friend sleeping in my usual spot i lucked out and got to sleep in the furnace room .
now the furnace room may sound like a dark scary basement but in reality it is much less ominous than it sounds .
this furnace was in place for the purpose of making hot water for floor heating showering etc .
it 's housed in a small room with two entrances connected indirectly to the house by the room above it the loft .
but it is an enclosed space with two thresholds that led to the outdoors .
one was four feet across a hallway-of-sorts to the front door .
to the left the door opened into a hallway leading to his driveway .
the second toward led to two places to the right his driveway and his side yard to the left .
the other door is positioned to the left of the first door on the far wall .
picture it this way the couch i was laying on was five feet from the first door at my 11 o'clock .
the second was about fifteen feet to my left at my 9 o'clock .
the furnace stood between me and the second door .
to my right was a window about a foot above the couch .
the furnace was on so it was pretty hot in the room .
i opened the window to get some ventilation and keep myself from sweating like a pig .
after half an hour of unsuccessful sleep i smoked some weed hoping that would help .
i took out my tablet and started watching netflix on my buddy 's wifi .
after a few minutes i began hearing the tapping .
it had n't been loaded in a couple hours so i assumed the fire was dying out and making some noise .
after the third set of taps i walked over and opened up the furnace to see if i could see what was making the noise .
when i opened the door to look inside the furnace almost empty .
most of the wood was ash with only a few small remnants of coals .
i thought it could be the furnace cooling and that i could just be unfamiliar with its creaks and groans .
i quickly turned around and locked the door behind me .
as i walked towards the second door to repeat the tapping stopped .
then i heard scuffling to my left behind the door near the furnace .
i realized what was happening after my body had already reacted .
by the time i processed my need to lock the other door one hand was on the doorknob and the other was securely twisting the latch into place .
the scuffling moved in front of the door and then went silent .
i knew the door was locked and i had a relatively solid barrier in front of me but i felt fear .
fear i had n't felt since i was a kid having nightmares .
it had a hollow note to it though i could n't pinpoint any memories associated with the sound but it terrified me nonetheless .
i slowly backed away from the door and stood in front of the couch for a moment .
i gathered a fire poker that i rationalized i could use as a weapon in case of entry but i knew i was just trying to comfort myself .
if whatever it was was n't my friends fucking with me and it gained access to this room i was toast .
so i sat down on the couch and tried to distract myself .
my anxiety slowly diminished as the tapping became more infrequent and the sun began to rise .
not that i could see the damn thing but i watched the sky slowly lose its darkness as the sun rose .
it was cloudy out so it was less of a blue sky than a gray-white one .
before the sky could be light enough to be considered morning but light enough not to be night i heard a small rustling to my right .
i quickly got up and shut the window which closed/opened with one swing of a lever .
i sat down and tried not to look at the window listening intently for any action outside of it .
i cursed myself for allowing my guard to drop .
i stood up and looked out ... and then stopped dead in my tracks .
no i did n't see anything or anyone largely due to the fact that it was pitch black out .
i know i was watching the far door while listening for anything outside the window .
i just zoned out staring at the furnace and listening to its small intermittent noises .
i also know that it was getting light out earlier .
it was just past dawn by my best judgement when i had looked out the window before .
i rushed through my memory of the last few hours .
i was still a bit drunk and had been smoking all night but i knew it was getting light out before .
my episodes had never had this kind of effect .
i had experienced some pretty weird shit before tonight but my world had never changed like this .
i do n't know if time went back three hours or some thing was fucking with my world hardcore .
it could be a hallucination but i had slept til 2 that day so the amount of sleep deprivation i had was way too early for that .
i 'm scared the doors are locked and i do n't know what to do .
my fianc√©e and i have n't been dating for that long but we have clicked like crazy .
i met him through my best friend of 20 years .
we met when we went to dinner with my bestie which turned into our first date .
in the end we exchanged numbers and talked constantly for the next few days .
we made plans for a legitimate date and that turned into seeing each other daily .
eventually he asked if i would go steady i happily agreed .
our respective families loved the other person his family has made me feel welcome and it 's a great feeling .
he brought up marriage asking if i saw myself getting married am i ready to settle down etc .
i told him yes getting too old for this dating stuff but i 'm in no hurry .
yesterday new year 's day he proposed after we had spent nye together .
i said yes obviously everything has come so easily in our relationship .
i could n't see myself being with anyone else .
we 've spent as much time as possible getting to know each other made plans to move in together and he knows all my dark secrets and such .
i 'm marrying my best friend it feels amazing !
my sister has depression and bi-polar ii she 's moody judgemental and has been waiting on a ring from her boyfriend for 6 years .
but she 's my sister and i love her .
i decided i would tell her first to gauge reactions and figure out if telling the rest of my family would be a good idea .
she has n't met him as she lives halfway across the country but i love her and want her approval .
she called me an idiot i never married bf of 5 years and bf of 3 years what makes him so special ?
i 'm making a mistake and jumping into things .
it 's way too soon i 'm such an idiot how could i do this ?
i told her i love him gave her 100 reasons why this is right .
she 's been texting me telling me i 'm a moron .
now it 's a little scary break the news to the rest of our families .
he told his best friend and asked him to be his best man .
now we are taking my best friend to the spot of our first date with her to tell her the news .
we both feel like our families would be okay with it but my sister scolding me has put a damper on things .
not too long before this my mother asked if he was husband materiel .
she 's the first guy i 've brought around that she likes and she told me she 's so glad i 'm happy .
i feel like she would be okay with it but my sis is n't helping anything .
tl dr engaged after short relationship sister 's bitter attitude ruining the excitement .
my schedule online is forcing me to make a new password again and nothing i type in seems to work .
it wo n't even let me click change password '' .
i looked at all the criteria and made sure i met all of it in regards to the new password .
i guess target makes you change your password every few months or so because this is probably the fourth time i have had to do this .
has anyone else been having trouble with the corporate site for employees ?

i 'm familiar with all the linux options keepalived lvs corosync/pacemaker but i 'm asking for a friend who is n't comfortable with linux .
ladies i always loved feeling and admired women 's feet while she is on top of me or i am on top of her or while she is sucking me .
how does that feel to you ladies when your man grabs and feels your feet in the middle of the action ?
does it add any extra turn on to you or makes any difference while having sex ?
if we were following along on the track '' lead a number of people ended up eyeing holiday express .
dovetail games etc etc if you 've been on this hype train this long you already know .
in the screenshots of holiday express there is the train number then the blocks with numbers on them and the mph signs with numbers .
i 'm pretty sure that these have been the same screenshots since last year but maybe they based a clue around it still ?
maybe we can input an ip address ala http 463.114.40.30 by the order i saw .
i 'm not very good at stuff like this but we 've had to use spectrograms so far but no page sources and no ip addresses .
these kinds of things are common in args ilovebees for halo and online puzzles ala notpr0n .
edit how is there not a single review for holiday express ?
i can see why no one would buy it but really ?
edit of edit guys obviously i was giving an example i do n't think i deserve to be thumbsed down since the ip address is incorrect/does n't work .
i do n't have the answer i was just providing a suggestion of a path we might consider based on a lot of other args that i 've taken part in .
we battle twice a day starting around 1am 1pm pst .

i 'm currently in high school and taking a gap year so that i can rectify my grades and apply for a better university next year .
i was wondering whether it 's possible to apply now for full time work for a year beginning in september when school usually begins .
i need to be working or getting experience throughout my gap year next year but i obviously ca n't begin full time work now as i 'm still in full time education and will be until june .
is it possible to apply for a job now that i 'd begin at the beginning of q3/q1 or august/september ?
edit i live in the uk if that narrows anything down .
the biggest issue i 'm having with narwhal is viewing comments after visiting a post/link .
after visiting a link i often accidentally tap 'back ' to the home page when i want to see the comments .
there 's no way to get from the home page to the comments on a post directly .
also after viewing the content of a link and swiping down the half screen of comments to view it the 'view comments ' button only flies in to half screen .
presumably if i tap the 'view comments ' button i am done viewing the content and want a full screen of comments .
just some rambling thoughts on my usage/experience so far ...
i do n't have a backup pc for gaming .
hopefully it was just precautionary measures i know there are amazing physicians all around him who will know what 's up .
which cases is dropping right now and which case can you no longer get ingame ?
does anyone know when the financial aid holds will release and credit into our accounts ?
it 's getting really close to the payment deadline and it has already been '10 days prior to classes starting . '
at higher levels of play getting stuck with a bad comp is almost a guaranteed loss .
it 's like i 've come to a point where i feel like switching games .
not to mention the fact that i played 20 games today and 3 of them were against a full 5 man premade team and all 3 games i had no premade groups on mine .
that is so unfair considering they get to pick their team comp entirely and you get stuck with blizzard 's shitty comps .
this provides some context since i ca n't diagnose my own problem https np.reddit.com/r/christianitygaming/comments/3z7phz/slightly_offtopic_a_message_to_all_conservatives
hi i 've lurked around this subreddit for a while and i wanted to know if you guys know of any good relatively cheap usb mics .

i 've seen the dental x-rays and apparently my adult tooth just went sideways .
it 's there just no way in hell it can be forced down .
the general consensus in the culture is its easier for them to get it done now than later even if they choose not to wear it later on .
now she has had them she is honestly taking it way better than i had when i got my 2nd set at 18 .
her discomfort only lasted 3 hrs after the piercing and she hasnt noticed them after daily cleanings rubbing on clothes baths etc .
there was a bench on the bench there was a man .
could the man play the ukelele he held what was his name what was his story ?
well from the way he was blindliny strumming the wooden thing in his hands he was not trained in the art of uke-ing but he was certainly of interests of interest to the new girl was of a different question entirely .
she would have to do something to find out about hon she would have to do something terrifying and incredibly difficult to do .
she would have to say hello to a stranger !
it 's literally as easy as taking the old one off and putting the new one on in the same place .
take out the screws that hold it take the hose off and reverse it with the new one before refilling the coolant according to your manual .
i hope he 's been practising his english whilst rehabbing his injury because it really will help him in the long run
reporting from 2350 the cards in the hyperexile zone particularly the living cards they 're the treasure cards '' in return to the battle for zendikar '' are beginning to stir .

somewhere close to two years ago my wife was in a bad situation with various drugs cocaine included .
it was a difficult time for her to leave that behind my being there helped her through that from what she has said to me .
drug addiction is something she would have been able to control regardless it was just easier with people that cared for her well being .
my eyes have been opened to that side of life and my heart goes out to addicts .
decriminalization would help more people understand drug addicts need help instead of jailing and shaming them .
maybe mascot suits is the way to protect our players from concussions

i have depression myself and i 'm also in a relationship .
it seems like you really care about your girlfriend and it 's really sweet that you want to do more .
i think a lot of what you can do to make her feel better depends on her personality so you can always just be direct and ask what you can do whether she wants to talk about it or needs some space .
for me i always appreciate when my boyfriend just holds me close when i 'm upset or does little chores around the house to help .
depression just affects everyday living for me it 's a constant battle .
it helps tremendously to have emotional support from my so .
also wanted to add learn as much you can about depression .

my younger bothers ex black girlfriend lives right across the street from me .
in 1992 i bought my place and mortgage is now paid for .

she is a divorced single mom and has three wonderful young daughters .
i had this dream where i was at school and my parents were walking with me down the entrance floor then left me .
then i saw this girl and was weirded out because i go to an all boy 's high school actually the best high school in new york xavier but i digress .
then i put my hand out to shake her hand and introduce myself .
by the way i just turned 14 in real life and am a freshman who never had a girlfriend but there was a situation with this one girl but that is for another time .
so i fall down a bit of stairs which in real life is all the way on the other side of the lobby .
so she picks me up and it was weird because i could n't get up and she was very strong we talk and we hit it off .
by the way she 's a cute pale girl with brunette hair very pretty .
so we go out and we have coffee etc .
then i ask her some questions like her favorite color .
then someone asked her name and she said scarlet pomer .
then her birthday then how old she is then we are by a house and she said 25 then i say i 'm 14 .
for those of you who do n't know who that is she was an actress who played kira on the show reba but she was her in adult form .
then after minutes of silence i say i 'll go and we did n't say anything else and i left .
this dream pissed me off a lot because in real life i am very shy and ca n't talk to girls because i am not good at that and i 'm scared of getting hurt again so yeah there was one other dream i had which was really weird .

btw i 'm not calling you ugly just taking you at your word .
i have known a few guys in my life that have been able to get nice looking girlfriends but still fuck real ugly women here and there .
because they had super sex drives were n't worried about being judged and the women were there .
i do n't think less of them i think it 's a little odd but whatever .
in short i do n't think that you disrespect yourself by fucking an ugly chick i think you disrespect yourself by worrying about what other people think about you .
just go for it dude find an ugly chick and start by saying hi '' .
i 'm not gon na judge i 've been there .
thanks for the link i guess i missed that somehow .
dunno if it has to do with fleury being back but pittsburgh is playing with so much confidence right now looks great .
ignoring the contents of a hardfork the hardfork changes themselves may be centralizing it requires you to trust a central authority or set of central authorities to trust and tell you the new consensus rules .

create a visitor that throws an exception when you want to cut off the search then put your call to breadth_first_search inside of an appropriate try/catch block .

so how do you account for thermic effect of food ?
the calories burned in the process of digesting food usually 10-15 depending on the food is just another iteration of calories out '' i.e .
it all comes down to calories in vs calories out .
now what gets put on either side of the in '' vs out '' column is a separate matter .
perhaps alcohol makes you more physically active so you expend more calories dancing drunk and laughing hysterically in which case perhaps your night of binge drinking burned more calories than you consumed pro tip it did n't .
no it just means you have to put some more numbers in the out '' column for your calculation to be accurate .
it 's simple the thermal effect of food gets added to the calories out '' variable of the calculation .
if calories in '' is represented by i then the thermal effect of food would be say 0.1i i.e .
calories consumed in excess of energy requirements calories consumed by food and drink calories expended at basal metabolic rate calories expended from physical activity above your bmr
you would instead add another variable to the end calories expended digesting food
you can further quibble over things like whether the calories on the label of your food the first part of the equation before the equal sign is actually what it says it is .
turns out calorie counts on labels can legally have a margin of error of something like 10 if i remember correctly .
or you try to tease out more accuracy from the bmr calculation by undergoing expensive laboratory testing to ascertain precisely what your bmr is .
the point being calories in vs calories out is always the full and complete end-of-story explanation for the energy balance of an organism .
the difficulty is ascertaining an accurate count of those calories in either or both directions .

that 's true we do n't know the rules '' of the avatar world when it comes to naming traditions .
plus the reveal that varrick and zhu li both had family names gave me the impression that most people in the avatar world have them we just never hear them .
before that i 'd stuck to the fan theory that only wealthy families used family names though royal families were more known by their titles but from what we 're told varrick did n't start out rich and i doubt zhu li was either .
and he 's from the same country as korra so i expect she 'd have a surname too unless avatars give them up or something .
i 'm not really a korrasami shipper but my assumption would be that they 'd probably both keep their names if they got married even if it was traditional for one partner to take the other 's name .
asami 's surname is tied to her business and dead family while korra 's is probably tied to the water tribe royal family and the name people knew the avatar as .
we 've seen earth kingdom southern water tribe and fire nation descended characters with family names .
i think the only exception would probably be the original air nomads who did n't really have family units anyway .
it 's because she 's an alumni or fan of florida state university which has a very good american college football team with a ton of fans on reddit .
those fans are probably responsible for the huge down votes .

idk if people are going to rave about mn9 like they are with undertale .
people are already hating the game because of some drama surrounding it .
one of my favorites my top is probably diamond 's are forever '' ... followed by nobody does it better '' tied with for your eyes only '' .
i 'm glad you have found closure on the topic .
i 'll give you the one where the guy threatened to kick my ass .
i am sure your puppers would make a sammy if he was not human challenged .
could barely keep up with the second when it got to the mid sentences however .
i 'm as liberal as they come but that whole site is just really shitty anti-republican tripe .
if you need more grays i recommend artkal 43 and hama light gray .
is it not possible to follow up if fox di 's out of your pillar combo on fd ?
yea i get this too it seems to happen around 00-:25 window .
so i usually log in before wait until 25 and then relog .
u can do both bro just moderate that shit cut down .
terrorism is the act of targeting innocent civilians in an attempt to cause fear and panic which is used to further an agenda .
these people have n't attacked anyone and threatened to retaliate if they were confronted physically by police .
that does n't really fit with what terrorism is meant to be .
while i ca n't comment on this situation as i 'm not familiar with the arrest/trial/resentencing that spawned it what i do find troubling is the eagerness of people to label this terrorism .
everyone talks about the hypothetical gap in pay between men and women but i have yet to ever see any data that compares salaries in given fields between women and men with some extra breakdowns such as education levels or years of experience .
the data that is being presented is just for a shock value or click bait .
is anyone surprised that daycare workers make less money per year than mechanical engineers ?
that is n't to say both professions are solely performed by one gender but the ratio of gender in both professions is heavily in favor of women and men respectively .
why is this kind of data or journalism even still accepted ?
i also did n't think i 'd ever get it after not rolling it since august .
i hope it turns up eventually for you too !
bulls fan here to wish faried the best of health .
did not like watching him on the sideline like that .
feel like the outcome of this game would have been different had that not happened .
most of them are created just after a new dino is added and they do n't know what to use for food .
without them some of the comedy i get from viewing them on my laptop would make life while im crafting the stuff i need boring .
i am not sure why the trade is failing ?
i just tested a trade with someone else and it worked for me ?
he would be a terrible ambassador these days he turned his back on this community remember ?
then i remembered my uncle who was a defense attorney and it basically ruined his life .
for a while my old ipod was convinced the date was january 1970 every time i turned it on .
hey there i noticed that you 're talking about an event primary or caucus in your post !
you may already know this but there 's a great ridesharing application to make it much easier for people to attend bernie events together and ultimately go to caucuses and polls together with the goal of increasing voter turnout !
it 's called ridewithbernie and it 's integrated into the official bernie 2016 event map .
there 's just 3 simple steps to set up your rideshare and make bernie proud
1 locate and click on the event you wish to attend on this map http www.bernie2016events.org zipcode distance=50 eventtype=r eventtype=cw eventtype=e eventtype=d eventtype=b eventtype=o daterange=all-events and then click on the blue carpool button on the event popup .
2 a page will appear with basic instructions that say how ridesharing works fill out a quick profile .
3 then just fill out your first name phone number and location you 'll be leaving from in the text boxes and then you 're done with set up !

fellaini was great for me but only as a cm just in there to knock people off the ball and to win headers in midfield .
he only worked when used either cm or a second cdm .
everyone will love you for it and help you out .
also take a guide book once you know where you want to go and where you want to stay things are pretty easy .
like how the gates only go between earth and abydos .
or how jack is a raging jerk in the movie but a funny cool dude in the show .
yeah they joke about how he spells his name differently but he still went on the abydos mission somehow .
or how the goa'uld are n't human hosts in the movie just slaves and ra looks more like an asgard meets alien instead of the snake thing we all love to hate .
plus it says that he is the last of a dieing race but all of a sudden nope !
watch it once for context but skip it every rewatch .
makes me real worried about emmerichs involement in the new stargate .
stop focusing on giving her an orgasm ask her to be more vocal about what she likes/if she needs you to adjust it a little/what feels better .
be content if it goes nowhere it 's not the goal it 's the journey .
it is a movie about rescuing indian citizens from another hostile country the role indian government played in it bound to have nationalistic streak .
there is so much turnover in off campus housing that inevitably couches are left behind because people are too lazy or they 're old and disgusting .
so a lot of times you 'll have an extra couch or 2 because you have your own you 're bringing .
so people are n't burning their nice ones or the ones they use everyday .
there just is n't the same surplus of ottomans or endtables .
plus they do n't make nearly as big of a fire .
if you want readability definitely do not go with the king james .
late 90s action games in general have aged horribly the controls and camera of most of them are terrible by today 's standards .

4 colours of smoke on 1 building will give the enemy a free smokescreen and there 's nothing you can do about it

i was actually a huge fan of it as well .
i think it could actually be one of my favorite zelda games right behind ocarina of time .
8x is still a large sum of money i put in 10 and after 40 years it still wo n't be 400k or what ever 8x adjusted inflation is .
have n't had the chance to read the article i 'll read once i get home from work .
the games that removed it sure a few worked but a lot them just added it in another way .
this game in a sense is like a mmo and has levels in a way .
it 's a progression that is demanded if it 's via levels or ranks in a game like cod .
it 's part of our current gaming culture and growing .
even single player games are turning into single player mmo 's .
i enjoyed it more than the previous 2 movies .
i did not have high expectations for it but it was easily worth the ride .
1 it means you actually elect people who will do something about it
2 it means you actually pay attention to c-span 2 when they are airing congress while debating new bills .
3 it means you actually demand that the laws in regards to fraud are followed and that there are sufficient means in the laws to prevent any organizations from legally committing fraudulent behavior .
4 it means you demand that the agencies who are tasked with monitoring these activities actually do their job and if they do n't .
they do n't just lose their job but they also serve jail time for collusion .
5 it means you stop bending over and taking it with this self defeatist attitude that there is not a single thing that you can do or even believing that what they are doing is perfectly acceptable .
i do n't know what 's so hard about understanding what these words mean .
but then there 's that line about poetry truth and how much most people hate poetry ...

my eyes would follow the highlighter and my brain would digest information in that linear format .
i also highlighted key points that i would need to answer the question while doing this so i only ever read articles once and just went back to small highlighted sections afterwards .
vegans obese lip smacking boring bragging about having an ass but do n't have anything bragging about being an asshole '' non cultured man hating feminist demeaning judgemental not able to have fun ... and those who have to have coffee in the morning personal reasons for that one

wroc≈Çaw is must-see especially this year as it is european capital of culture and there is a lot of stuff going on around here .
that 70hour estimate is way off or then araxxi actually does damage very slowly .
they last 55hours of combat if you get 30ticks of degrade/min on average .
to count as degrading tick '' one of following needs to happen on that tick
fury drains 3 charges per use as it hits 3 times bleeds e.g .
there is a hard cap of 1 charge lost per tick 100 per minute .
am i the only one who noticed the jets have played literally no one this season ?
they played against the two worst divisions in football which are last time i checked are really really bad .
the chiefs had a easy second half but damn look at this schedule .
that 's one team with a for sure winning record and potentially two more if the redskins and texans win their final game .
at this point i 'd be contacting the banking comptroller for your state or even the federal comptroller .
that is a serious data breach and imo you need to also file with the local pd for identity fraud .
i 'd also go to r/legaladvice to see if you can make this stick .
perhaps then your mother will stop trying to know your banking information .
i 'll have to check out substance it 's one of those things that i 'd love to own but i just would n't use enough to justify the price .
it is just awesome though to watch giant time lapses of people working in substance so i 'll have to give that trial a try finally .
maybe you 'll have more luck than i did doing it as a woman .
it became too popular after it was mentioned on orange is the new black .
that sounds like it did n't get the right am service which would mean that either the kernel exploit failed result is n't checked because it 's a lazy build and the way fbi gets launched does make it less stable or that i put the wrong build in the zip .

of course that 's the original plan but looks like it 's not working
4 or 6 guys are the main contributors ms employees and that 's not enough to even implement ios 6 level features .
i am sorry but what was promised in the project islandwood session video and what was finally presented are two completely different things .
the project is in a pitiful state with a quasy archaic ios 6 level api and even as that so much of it is implemented as stubs or worse in a very naive and incorrect manner .
this project is at least two years away from being able to call it remotely ready by which time it would be five years of api behind the times ...
i am sorry but to me this project seems like a pr stunt by microsoft .
it is not taken seriously ... what is that ?
i think you are missing the point of the project .
it was supposed to let ios software developers take an existing project and with minimal effort port it to windows mobile which is in dire need of software .
tl dr what was promised in the project islandwood session video and what was finally presented are two completely different things .
i am sorry but to me this project seems like a pr stunt by microsoft .
this big bash has had so much history this week !

homeless man who wanted to compliment my backside ... for several blocks

of course the main thing there was that i was in no position to have kids then so that 's probably a thing to regret as well .
can you go into more detail about the stretches '' you usually would n't do for breaking ?
i can also tell you that the language is not appropriate if you want to continue the conversation .
if you continue with the language you show that you do n't mutually respect the person in the conversation .
you therefore are responsible for not honoring the request .

then you are talking at a person not with them .

for beginners it often helps to wait what the brain will start thinking next which will cause silence .
i realize that thoughts are just reflections of what 's going on inside which helped me a lot going through phases of negativity and well let 's call it what it is depression .
often it also helps me to eat though some people might not have such an inbalance like i do .
i 'm not af risk getting fat though so it 's a great idea for me to grab food to raise my mood .

keep your steam library on the hdd then just point steam steam preferences downloads manage libraries to your games and voila .

can a lawyer from a top law school who has 8 houses and a bentley but also crippling depression really claim to be above average joe ?
joe does n't make as much money but he has a family hobbies friends and memories of all the cool shit he did while not being a workaholic .
you seem to have a very narrow metric for success .
if a guy is happier streaming on twitch making 30k a year than he is working for google coding all day for 80k is he less successful than he could have been ?
this is n't canon but i liked this idea from van buren .
vb states that after the oil rig was destroyed the enclave realized that the chosen one had traveled across the ocean from san francisco and so destroyed san fran in retaliation .
the thing i like about this is regardless of what you did in san francisco there is no canonical answer .
since now both the shi and hubologists have been permanently destroyed they can not return and say what the chosen one did/did n't do in san fran .

the thorium reactor project was in the works at the time of the first moon landings at oak ridge ...
it 's not a terrible game it 's just that dishonored came out first and did it better .
the reason i do n't like the anti valve circle jerk is that you guys always complain and you still buy from steam .
i keep some rubber plates outside where they 're not directly exposed to the sun or get wet but i 'm not sure if that will damage them over time nonetheless .
the bar stays inside because suppose it 'll be very prone to oxidise and rust .

i feel like if it had to do with those they would have actually used one of the glyphs .
also as far as i can tell they do n't have any meaning which would mean that even if it were one of those glyphs it would make the clue indecipherable and nothing more than an obtuse reference .
the host gamertag needs to add you as a friend in order for you to join .
dolphin is what happens when you have people who are very experienced with software architecture leading and working together on things such as tools backend stuff debugging automated testing etc ...
better tools easier to figure out bugs easier to implement new features .
also it 's a nintendo platform so almost by default you 're going to have more people working on it than pcsx2 .
it 's worth noting that it took dolphin a long time to actually get that kind of team .
in the early days it was just a few hackers now they have a ton of contributors and good infrastructure to support it .
no reason pcsx2 could n't get there too if it is n't already .

voltage gaming is looking for a smite team to recruit .
please hit me up on here twitter is www.twitter.com/voltagegamingco or at our email voltagegamingcommunity1 gmail.com
defending on a splitter type usually becomes more and more favorable relative to attacking the bigger the splitter gets assuming the same attack to absorb tradeoff .
for example if the biggest absorber is wall attacking with doomed mech gives up two absorb for two attack and it 's four/four for arka sodara .
however i want to hold arka more than i want to hold doomed mech since the amount of extra defense i do n't have to buy that turn is greater 7 points rather than 5 .
based on this if the game designers wanted to make it a maximally hard decision whether to defend or attack with each splitter type they might do something where once the splitter gets big enough the health drops a point relative to the attack value .
anyone know why this might be or devs care to comment ?
what other considerations are there in choosing health and attack numbers for splitters besides making the click decision difficult ?
i am completely new to competitive and i have had really bad luck with match making .

i was wondering if a neural network could be used in the following way and maybe some if you has some insights .
i want to present the network a couple of inputs .
those inputs represent different options to choose from i. e. different behaviours .
then the network does it 's thing and gives back an output .
based on the highest output value the network would have made a choice '' .
based on it 's behaviour the player gets to treat or punish the ai .
but here is my problem i have no right/wrong for every node since the node represents a single behaviour .
i just do n't want that single node to activate .
so when i adjudt the weights do i just change the values that lead to that particular node ?
it seems a bit off because only a part of the network would learn '' each time .
is it possible to use techniques like back propagation in a mimo network on one output and the connections leading to it ?
or do i have to touch the whole network each iteration ?
i now have at least 70000000 experience points in the constitution skill .
would it be worth it in the long run to get skylake ?

so i used to take adderall all the time and have no problems but i decided to quit and tapered off and went clean a few months .
now i am trying to start up moderate use again but even 5mg seems like an atom bomb to my brain .
i seriously just take flakes 1mg if that ... honestly lately i ca n't even take adderall at all i take dexedrine if anything but it does n't motivate me in the same way adderall used to .
most of the time i just get really sleepy and end up falling asleep and using the afterglow motivation once im rested .
i always feel like the anxiety blocks my ability to think clearly and i get the urge to take a dose of xanax to curb the edgy feeling .
i think i remember taking 1mg of klonopin and some hydros just to chill out that initial first few weeks ... thinking maybe i should try something similar again .
i really need to be able to tolerate this drug and i ca n't figure out why i ca n't .
i have a slight benzo tolerance right now like .5 mg a day so benzos seem less effective .
i also smoke weed not on adderall but i usually have a bowl in the morning dunno if that matters ?
i do n't remember having such a problem before ... the adderall would just kick in and i would feel great and do a bunch of stuff now its like an anxiety attack mixed with uncontrollable irritability .
can only take dexedrine but it puts me to sleep then i wake up semi-motivated .
once the mohammedans pull it down you wo n't have to worry about that anymore .

i 'd been going through my photo albums deleting duplicates and bad shots mostly and kept forgetting that in order to delete photos i have to hit cmd+del .

i do n't like being the only one who texts first or initiates first .
it makes me feel confused even though men are often expected to be initiators and such .
i currently work full time for 12/hour and my pays usually range from 700 1000/bi-weekly .
i just recently moved in to an basement apartment .
power typically runs me about 50/month and 70/month for internet .
i have a cat that costs about 50/month to take care of .
i have to pay a 300 deposit on power and 150 deposit on internet for activations/setups/etc .
for some reason i just ca n't bring myself to not spend money as much as i know i need to .
is there any advice at all you can give me ?
this is a generic thread for frequently asked questions .
it may not always be 100 accurate as optimal builds tend to change with buffs nerfs and theorycrafting .
do not get mad at me or anyone else if you think something else is better instead share your ideas down below .
this is so people stop asking the same questions over and over and so people do n't have to read an entire guide for answers .
but they will be updated when new information is given and your feedback will help update them .
you can also ask for more questions to be added to the faq this is just the beginning .
build general rule of thumb always subject to preference circumstance and gold value when you 're shopping .
tiamat i upgrade to ravenous right after completing ghostblade .
pick up shiv/rfc ie and trinity and/or essence reaver depending on your preference in whichever order floats your boat .
final build at 50 min will probably look like ravenous youmuu 's shiv infinity edge trinity force essence reaver sold boots .
edit duskblade of draktharr dekar is a new item as of patch 6.3 and is certainly an acceptable build if you go ravenous/ghostblade/duskblade/trinity/item of your choice ie merc scim maw .
not necessarily better than the crit build but certainly effective yet to be determined if better or worse .
in the jungle you 'll probably just follow this build with an early warrior or skip the warrior entirely dependent on how hardcore you are .
maw is also a possibility to consider if against heavy ap .
as for bruiser rengar titanic cleaver and then full tank items seems to be the most effective build .
sterak 's gage is also pretty effective against heavy burst comps .
bruiser rengar as of season 6 is pretty much the only way to survive toplane against good junglers at the moment .
a mixture of titanic ghostblade cleaver something along those lines seems to be the most effective way to make it out of toplane alive currently .
hp seals acceptable dependent on preference but not usually .
choose between ad or armor pen for marks and quints .
ad makes it easier to last hit in lane and a bit better jungle clear early game .
it also gives some advantage in lane dependent on the opponent 's armor generally speaking ad is more effective than flat armor pen versus tanks but that 's not always the case .
you 're gon na have to experiment with these rune pages and see which you prefer .
cdr mr unless against a heavy ap toplane for glyphs .
cdr almost always is better in the jungle regardless .
decide if you want flat or a mixture of flat and some scaling cdr .
this will also depend on your build path preference .
prioritize the attack speed and double-edged sword in the ferocity tree .
then choose whether you prefer the minimal ad/ap or minimal lifesteal/spell vamp and the bounty hunter/oppressor .
personally i prefer oppressor due to the length of rengar 's decaying slows and snares but bounty hunter will outscale .
in the cunning tree personally i choose wanderer for the movespeed but savagery is also alright especially in the jungle .
bandit and dangerous game are both good bandit is n't helpful in the jungle so take dg for sure when jungling .
i 've seen people run intelligence for the 45 cdr cap and it 's definitely fine certainly in the jungle where you 'll get blue buffs and warrior for additional cdr opportunities .
18/12/0 is also very good as of patch 6.3 .
it was recently buffed and is definitely pretty effective in dishing out the deeps .
0/12/18 6/6/18 and 12/0/18 are all pretty effective variations of the mastery page you 'll want to run with the bruiser build .
take what you want and more prioritize from ferocity and cunning but focus your points in the defensive tree if you decide you want to brawl with titanic .
try recovery tough skin runic armor for the heals insight for the summoner spell cdr very strong your choice between legendary guardian and swiftness both great i value lg more for the teamfight tanking potential since i get movespeed anyways from cleaver and r but most importantly take grasp of the undying .
grasp of the undying is one of the best keystones in the game .
empowered q right as you get in leap range .
mid-air hit w and tiamat/hydra at the same time .
there 's a small delay of maybe .25s between using empowered q and the following regular q so get an auto attack in and animation cancel it into your regular q .
empowered q again if they 're somehow still alive .
if they are you probably jumped on a tank .
you 'll gain about 1 ferocity mid-air 1 ferocity from e 1 ferocity from w 1 ferocity from your regular q and a split second after you 'll get the last ferocity and be able to empowered q again .
mid-air aim and press empowered e right before you land .
again if timed and used properly almost impossible to miss .
immediately auto reset your jump with q and press w at the same time due to its lack of cast time .
point blank land your regular e on the snared target and cancel the throwing animation with an instant tiamat/hydra activation .
you can also tiamat/hydra and then use regular e last but finishing with the tiamat tends to cancel faster into the next auto attack should you need one .
after a moment you should have the ferocity for another empowered ability of your choice .
use 1 against champions you know you can burst in that combo squishies when you have 2 items or lower hp targets .
use 2 against champions you need to lock down .
also more effective prior to finishing 2 items in general since the snare has high base damage but gets outscaled by the empowered q .
exhaust is great against burst champions great for turning 1v2 's surviving ganks and other clutch situations and shutting down two targets in a teamfight one with your burst the other with this spell .
is harder to use effectively than ignite though so you may need to practice it .
ignite has higher kill pressure in lane depending on the situation and tends to be more effective versus champions with high healing properties such as vladimir nasus or mundo .
teleport has the best global pressure of course with the biggest issue is its lack of outplay potential .
you 're trading in the ability to win lane at times for the ability to win other people 's lanes for them .
as much as that might sound like a good idea it 's often more important that you get ahead than that your solo q teammates get ahead so it 's kinda iffy in the new season .
still acceptable probably still worth it against things like shen but otherwise i 'm less confident in taking it as i used to be .
if you 're gon na post a montage try to get clips that include bush mechanics and outplays rather than strings of oneshots .
you 're in a place full of rengar mains we are n't gon na ooh and ah your oneshots we do it all the time .
but we will be impressed if you display impressive skill with the champion .
im using a 360 controller and the left stick drifts either up wireless or down wired .
ive tried to use pinnacle game profiler or x360ce but for the life of me i cant figure how to make them work on gtav or at all ...

seriously we have one of the most stacked rosters in the nfl but when rodgers goes down we go 8-7-1 understandanle .
mccarthy has been holding us back for years and is just killing the potential of aaron rodgers and is the result of a talented roster .
but there 's a plethora of excuses when all is said and done .

where can i find afterword of the manga volumes until the current release ?
i am on a collection spree and i am doing the same with some other mangas too .
and i just saw him sitting buck naked in the middle of our locker room clipping his toenails .
the fact that a saw santa 's twin he better lay off the christmas cookies next year or that he was just letting his toenail clippings fly about everywhere .
it 's gon na be hard to get that image out of my head ... .
this is so stupid i ca n't believe i 'm writing a post about it but here it is .
over the last year i lost a lot of weight around 50 pounds .
i went from 210 to about 160 and i 've never felt better .
i worked my ass semi literally and the first month or so was absolute hell .
as someone who has been overweight since high school i am pretty proud of what i 've accomplished .
so anyway i put a few before and after pictures of myself on instagram i started last year as a new years resolution so it was like a one year update .
i 've found a lot of the people on there inspiring and wanted to tell my story and show a few pictures as well .
who knows maybe it will inspire someone as well .
well i get a text from my best friend saying this girl who went to our high school and grew up around us posted my pictures on her facebook saying i lost the weight due to her 'weight loss wraps ' .
i do n't know if you guys know what they are but it 's basically like saran wrap you wrap around your belly and it 's suppose to help you lose weight .
she sells it and i 'm 95 sure it 's bogus .
i do n't use facebook so i had a friend show me and there i am .
she did n't even have the courtesy to block out my face .
i suspect it 's because we have so many mutual friends and having it be someone they know saying the products 'worked ' for them holds a lot more sway .
i 'm pretty pissed i worked hard and feel like these products really take advantage of people who are looking for an easy fix .
so i messaged her on instagram just basically saying what are you doing take that down immediately and i 'm pretty sure she blocked me .
i ca n't see her insta any more but apparently the pictures are still on facebook .
i do n't mind the pictures on the internet obviously but it 's driving me nuts that people might think i lost the weight that way .
especially when i feel they take advantage of people .
tl dr old semi-friend is taking credit for my weight loss with her bogus wraps .
blocked me when i called her out on it .
im having trouble understanding why they could n't use the fact that his kit was opened then re-taped back together when nobody was supposed to have access to it before his lawyers .
i get that they used the blood sample testing regarding his blood in the car but why could n't they use the fact that his blood kit was tampered with in the first place ?
if the lawyers were trying to prove the case of police involvement in the evidence discovery would n't that fact be a smoking gun '' ?
i 've had at least some experience in modding i tinkered with flashcarts and homebrew on the ds have had cfw on my psp since forever modded the crap out of my wii .
i know it pays to be cautious and informed and know more or less what to do when i have things ready read instructions follow directions etc but i was hoping someone would n't mind answering a few questions for me .
i already have the basics down regarding getting hbl installed and running basic homebrew but for the more involved/risky stuff i 'm still a bit uninformed .
i 'm trying to wrap my head around everything that is entailed in hacking the 3ds what is required as well as what can be done and how and the resources that i can find are sometimes months old and/or contradict each other so i was hoping for some sort of comprehensive answer or at least a link to a good resource for each question from someone who is in the know .
i see hardmods being mentioned here and there as the primary way to create a backup of your system .
from my preliminary research it looks like this involves soldering a few contact points on the system board then using an sd adapter to access the system nand to read/write backups .
is is possible to create a nand backup without a hardmod ?
if i 'm on a later system version and want to try and downgrade would it dumb of me not to have it as a fallback ?
where can i find someone who would do this for me and how much would i expect to pay ?
emunand appears to be a way of making the system load a copy of your system nand from the sd card rather than the built-in emmc .
from what i can find you generally have to use some kind of exploit to boot into emunand from sysnand .
or is it possible to do only from within the ds and its sd card ?
when i boot into emunand do i then have all the capabilities as if i were running in sysnand ?
if my emunand gets fucked for some reason how do i restore functionality ?
is it as simple as restoring/removing the emunand partition/files on the sd card ?
is is possible to damage my sysnand from within emunand ?
what is the main reason s for using emunand ?
i have only a cursory knowledge of this subject for the 3ds such as a notion that retail carts are handled differently than digital content but beyond that i 'm pretty clueless .
my understanding is that it is possible without a 3ds flashcard to load and play roms dumped from retail carts .
if so how would you do this requirements files/tools procedures etc .
how is that different from digital eshop preloaded etc .
is it possible to create dumps/backups of content installed/inserted in your system through homebrew ?
say i have a retail cart of a game is it possible to dump the rom to the sd card or by some other method ?
how about installed games/content can they be ripped somehow ?
if there 's anything i should have asked or should know please mention that as well i want to make sure i have all my bases covered here .
hi everyone i 'm about to start my final independent project where the purpose if it is to change how a vegan lifestyle is perceived to your average joe and motivate him/her to adopt the lifestyle longterm .
i believe there 's a huge rise in veganism right now like there was on meditation/mindfulness a few years back but the resources to fully commit are n't there yet .
so i 'm curious as to hear your thoughts on what was your epiphany moment and diving into the vegan world ?

bleacher report 's http bleacherreport.com team stream app is a good example
first thing you do is pick your favorite civs and stuff .
you then search for your favorite lore and oc and follow it to receive notifications .
there can be a companion for reading/posting in the sub including fan subs r/civbrfiction etc .
you could also watch/listen https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zba_u5av65e to the br parts with the narration by u/burgerkrieg .
notifications for general announcements toggleable fun fact no correct spelling for that exists of course .
the rest would be like the companion top right of the sidebar which really needs an update .
some info like sparta 's ai bias is also missing .
this spawned off a comment i made in the steam group idea post .
if no one here can make apps i 'm sure someone on r/civ or civfanatics http www.civfanatics.com will .

my budget is between ‚Ç¨450-550 and i will be buying the parts in sweden is this budget enough or do i need to increase it a bit ?
i will also invest in a display in addition to this and thinking of the benq xl2411z do you have any alternative suggestions around the same price tag with 144hz or is this a good display ?
this has probably come up several times by now .
i want to get involved in rust 's development .
however the information about the build system is scarce and scattered across multiple partly outdated sources .
so i am uncertain as to whether my build configuration is all that good .
that takes about one and a half hours to complete .
my machine is actually quite fast i7 32gb ram .
i also noticed that rustc utilizes one core only .
today i pulled in the changes from yesterday and rebuilt .
that took the same amount of time minus the initial llvm build .
i wonder if it is necessary to go through all the stages of bootstrapping with just a few changes .
if i just make a change to std do i have to rebuild the whole compiler again ?
i wonder how a seasoned rust contributor builds the compiler or just how her/his workflow is and what time that takes .
i thought i 'd share my experience with the suggestions made here
it seems that not doing a debug build and not disabling optimizations is the key as suggested by u/simonsapin .
i would not have thought that to make such a huge difference but apparently it does .
based on the suggestion by u/sanxiyn i passed virtually no options to configure besides enable-ccache .
the full initial build with llvm lasted roughly 19 minutes .
i went ahead and did another full initial build inside a ramdisk as proposed by u/wclaeder .
after a day i pulled in changes and rebuild in a ramdisk with
that used the blessed snapshot downloaded earlier to build the stage 1 compiler which is enough for testing i think .
this game is fantastic one of if not my favorite game out there at the moment .
but there 's something that sometimes really just kills it for me and that 's the god awful spawning system it has .
one moment you look behind you and there 's no zombies in site while kiting zombies on the other side the next thing you know you 're being hit from that same direction that you just looked at and there was nothing there just seconds prior to being struck .
it destroys the immersion of the game completely to have the thought of zombies just magically appearing out of thin air specifically for the intent of fucking you right in the ass .
sure it adds challenge to the game and i do love an apocalyptic style game that has challenge too it but zombies appearing out of what seems like complete nowhere is the wrong kind of challenge and needs to be fixed make it so when zombies spawn they can only spawn within a certain distance of you and do n't make it a close distance where you 're getting smacked from behind when there was nothing there 5 seconds beforehand make it so you would actually have to look in the distance quite a ways to see that there is a zombie out there that freshly spawned .
i 'm sure that i ca n't be speaking only for myself when i say that the spawn system is one of the worst issues if not the worst issue in the game as of now .
i hope that by the time this game is a full release it becomes fixed and until then all i can do is hope but if it happens to not be fixed i know that there will be plenty of disappointed people to see that this one terrible feature can essentially destroy the immersion of such a great video game for so many players .
when it first came out and was being translated by bagelson i really enjoyed it and then around chapter 25 it was dropped this was about a year ago .
recently i 've decided to get back into it and saw that zagreus is doing it .
after about 5 chapters i had to stop because the quality seemed pretty poor does anyone else feel that way ?
if you do do you think the quality improved in later chapters ?
also second question the requirements say 32gb of memory .
i 'm assuming that this is on top of the your host system so on my 32gb of ram i7 build wont run this ?
he 's been having low bloodsugar in the morning on relatively frequent occasions measured at 240 in the evening then wakes up at 92 or less the next morning disoriented .
his mitigation has been to eat more carbs in the evening with the effect that his evening measurements usually clock in at the 200 400 rate .
he takes lantus long-term insulin at night i believe around 20 units injected into the belly .
i am shocked by that it sounds as if he 's getting the worst of high and low blood sugar but i have too little insight .
my gut reaction was that he ought to take less insulin but from his logs it looks like he also often has nights starting in the 300s and ending above 150 in the morning .
do you guys have some observations/questions for him you can share to help me understand better ?
i heard these doctors are available at every home improvement store and do grinding and sawing etc .
i had one of my friends listen to zeiss contarex and he said that it sounded quite earthbound-esque .
can you think of any other autechre tracks that could easily fit into video games and if so what games ?

since i have some time i wanted to catch up on redditizing my account .
i think this is really a perfect example of why enterprise gets unfairly shat upon especially when people accuse it of disrespecting the fact that it 's a lead-in to tos .
they hung such a painfully perfect lampshade on the question and they did it in such a passing comment that most of us or i at least did n't even realize what they 'd done .
about five minutes into terra prime soval says that spontaneous demonstrations have already started outside the vulcan compound and then the andorian ambassador chimes in there are protesters chanting outside the andorian embassy and they 're using words that are n't in the universal translator .
again sorry if i 've just managed to be oblivious to people talking about this but i feel like i 've never seen this point raised when the selective translation issue with the universal translator is brought up .
i 've seen the explanation of it 's a tv show and they 're trying to make it colorful '' ... but damn they just very casually went ahead and stuck that explanation into canon basically .
and sure there are some times where it ignores enough klingon in tng and ds9 that even this explanation starts to unravel a little ... but holy shit it 's such a painfully obvious lampshade to hang on the problem and coto is so good that he seems to have been able to slip it in there without anyone realizing he 'd done it .
the universal translator ignores some things because the people programming it were trying to be diplomatic about what they made it translate and keep pointless unnecessary misunderstandings from happening .
all the conversation i can remember seeing on this point has always skipped right past this point and to be clear i did n't really get into trek until after enterprise was over so it 's not like i 'm remembering conversations from the 1990s from before this was put into canon .
it really goes to show you how coto really just got trek on a fundamental level before he was put in charge and unlike earlier in ent and voy ... and the tng movies ... just embraced being trek and really just ran with it he knew on a personal level what trekkies wanted to see but was able to do it in a way without just turning it into stereotypically fanservicey fanfiction .
it could have been unintentional but given how coto dealt with the discrepancy of klingons ' appearance in tos vs tng i find it very hard to believe that that line from the andorian ambassador was n't very specifically slipped in there and to boot i 'll end on admitting that yeah maybe i 'm a little too enthusiastically impressed with how artfully he just casually slipped that line in there .
i 'll be using this for web browsing document editing light video editing and battlefront .

hey guys i 'm getting back into dripping of over a year of just using tanks .

i 'm not a rengar main yet but my friend rode the freelo train to gold .
is there any skin/ward/icon that rengar mains use a lot or enjoy ?
besides seeing adcs driven before them and hearing the lamentation of their supports ofc .
my life has derailed and i have daily fantasies of running away to start over or killing myself .
sometimes i feel so much love for my children i ca n't imagine leaving them and sometimes i hate my life so much that i cry .
i could have left the woman i married so easily without them .
my dreams have died and i am so trapped financially that i ca n't move forward .
i feel so much pain and guilt for my feelings and want a different life .
we are roommates who stay together because we barely make ends meet .
i torture myself because i had a chance at a good life and pissed it away .
i was first generation college mother father and brother do not have past a high school education .
i was going to be a professional and see the world and live in major cities .
i worked my ass off in high school and got into a good state school and was doing pretty good .
then i made the biggest fuckup of my life .
i knocked up a girl within 2 months of hooking up with her .
she was not in school she has no interest in education and still works in retail and is incapable of or disinterested in discussing ideas or anything that is n't family oriented or gossip .
she refused to abort or do adoption and my family and hers put so much pressure on me to do the right thing so i married her and tried to be a husband and father .
i was able to stay in school with the first kid but my grades started to get worse because i had no time to study .
i lost my scholarships and had to take unsubsidized loans .
with how much more i was working and staying up extra to take care of the baby i became depressed and full of constant stress .
my wife was miserable with me because i was constantly busy and stressed and we had no money and it would last more years .
she antagonized me to drop out to work f/t and earn real money .
i told her that was short sighted and i needed my degree and then a masters to really to give us a good life and we 'd be poor for a while but come out better for it .
i think she thought i would leave her if i did well .
i cried and cried and felt like my life was over .
after the next one i went on academic probation and got kicked out .
it was a dark time and i almost killed myself but the guilt of leaving them to fend for themselves stopped me .
i have no time and no money for hobbies or vacations or education .
even if i managed to go back it 's so much harder no that i failed out and i 'll never get into as good of a school again .
they are precious too and in those moments i feel like a monster for wanting to leave them .
i feel like i am going to kill myself if i do n't run away from this life .
i want to finish my degree and get a masters .
i want to move to sf or la or ny .
i want to be with someone i feel intellectually stimulated by who wants me .
i do n't want to be in a family anymore .
i ca n't handle how it has crushed my happiness .
i ca n't afford child support as a single father .
my wife is immature and messy and snaps at the kids when she 's frustrated .
if i have sole custody then i really will never go back to school and even though i love them living with children makes me miserable .
how do i get through being so stuck financially and emotionally ?
how do i find a way to be happy and not abandon my children ?
edit i wanted to note that moving in with either sets of our parents is not an option .
my parents are dirt poor and living on public assistance in a small 1bd .
my brother has such severe bi-polar that he was declared medically disabled and lives off disability benefits .
her brother is moderately successful but behaves like an ass shat .
we originally turned to him for help and he offered me a job with his construction business .
while i was grateful that we were n't on the street he also took advantage of me .
he used me as his office manager and personal assistant on top of my normal work and my hours and pay were absurd .
i 'm not going for bo jackson and i 've got about 40 logos .
i thought there was gon na be a set for these logos for an after christmas special but i guess not .
what should i do with them sell for 2k or use them in the sets to sell the players ?
just want the best way to make i really thought there was gon na be a set for the logos right now .

i 'm trying to find a wood species that can be finished with a dark walnut like stain but offers a bit more warmth than walnut itself something just a bit more interesting .
sapele is an obvious option but i would really like some other ideas from the group .
thanks for the input i guess a better word would be interesting i 'm looking for a wood that offers some character like walnut but appeals to a high end home owner who wants something just a bit different .
i 'm looking at white walnut aka butternut black locust this is for an exterior door and maybe sycamore .
i walked into the evermore castle for a quest to see like 30-40 high levels hangin out and was curious as to what the deal is .

i heard of people making their own egpu and i 'm interested in this .
i was looking up tutorials for it and that but it said i needed either an expresscard slot which i do n't have an mpcie which should be inside my laptop but would n't be the most convenient way to connect it up or a thunderbolt port which i do n't have either .
would this work to connect my egpu up to my laptop ?
i 've not read the bible cover to cover in a llllooonnngggg time and i was a christian at the time .

and before anyone points it out i know about the skeptic bible .
i 'm writing a java program that is supposed to remove consecutive duplicate words from a string case-insensitive .
according to stack exchange i have the regex right but it is n't working in all cases
my first guess was a case sensitivity issue but i used ? i in the regex and java 's built in pattern compile pattern.case_insensitive flag but neither seems to help .
it seems the problem comes in when the first duplicate is a different case than the original and the second duplicate is different as well as in for for for or hte hte hte any ideas how to get around this ?
edit more testing seems to suggest it 's a problem when the number of duplicates is odd .
so test test test still outputs test test but i 'm not sure how to fix this

i 've been seeing a lot of questions about how guardians permanently die '' lore-wise so i thought i 'd throw out an answer .
basically a guardians ability to be revived in the lore comes down to 2 factors his light and his ghost .
different races have different ways of going about trying to kill you .
so the longer you 're in the darkness of the hive or the more times you die the more light is stripped from you by the hive feeding off it .
eventually your light is gone completely and you return to the husk you once were .
as for the ghost method the cabal orbital bombardment is a perfect example .
by using such insane and intense levels of focused destruction on a guardian their ghost can be destroyed and so naturally the guardian has no way of being revived .
i 'm assuming that after this your light is slowly drained by enemies or just over time from you being too far from the traveler while dead '' so eventually you permanently die .
tl dr if you get stripped of your light or you 're separated from your ghost your fucked unless your toland .

i 'm trying to solo around it but i 've noticed that the g minor pentatonic works with it but not always and then the a mior pentatonic also works at some points .
i know that the major and minor pentatonics are basically just a shift of the common scale shapes '' .
so the the g minot penta is the same as the a major penta right ?
do both scales work at seperate times because the song switches from major to minor in certain places ?
the g minor penta seems to work the most but droning the a root note during the song sounds the best and not the g note .

futures markets are open and the price of crude oil in the us and europe is surging on the back of increased tensions in the middle east after saudi arabia beheaded shiite cleric sheikh nimr al-nimr .

i just bought the game and there are a few items i would like to have that were released before i bought it as free dlc .
now to the most asked question tell me the best mutual fund .
according to some numbers i crunched of the 90 large-cap schemes in the market between 2005 and 2014 only one scheme came at the top more than once that too just twice in this period .
a total of 17 schemes made it to the top three in all these years .
this means no one scheme makes it to the top year after year .
you do n't want to waste time chasing last year 's winners .
the question you should be asking is this tell me a consistent good-performer .
a consistent good-performer makes it to the top quartile for most part of its entire performance history .

i 've wanted a telescope for as long as i can remember and finally this christmas i got a celestron astromaster 90az .
i 've already taken a look at the moon and jupiter and was surprised at how quickly i was able to view them .
i 've been watching a lot of videos and doing a lot of research and i was looking into being able to photograph through the eyepiece .
everything i 've watched/read said you can easily do this with a mount and a dslr camera .
my girlfriend has a brand new sony a5100 mirrorless camera but it is not a dslr .
is it impossible to take photos with a camera like this ?
everything says dslr specifically so i 'm worried this may not be sufficient to take the photos i 'd like .
i 'm already looking into a kit with filters and a couple extra eyepieces but if we ca n't use her new camera to do the photography she has an older dslr that we may be able to use .
have any of you had any luck with photography with a camera like this or is a dslr the only way to go ?
also given the telescope i have if i get a kit with a 2x power lens can i expect to see more detail out of jupiter ?
i was able to see it plus about 4 of its moons but it only looked like a hazy dot .
can i expect to be able to maybe see some of the stripes once i have more magnification ?
i do n't have issues with socks and underwear like many people do .
i do however have a huge issue with pants or anything with a waist .
it 's gotten to the point where i wear dresses every day because they are the only clothes that are comfortable .
i also hate tags on clothes or seams that are along my neck and stomach .
usually that 's not a problem as i can easily clip them off most of the time .
are there any ways to make it so it 's not so bad ?
i was going to sell these to cardcash but figured i 'd see if anyone here was interested .
i just found this subreddit read the rules and hope i 'm doing this right but if not please let me know .
i have two itunes cards one for 50 and one for 25 that i 'd like to trade together .
i 'd prefer to trade for another gift card or combination of but i 'd also be open to paypal if trading is n't an option .
obviously i 'd love a 1:1 trade but i value lego walmart and amazon cards the highest and i 'm also flexible in terms of retailers especially if they sell lego !
pls advise which one would be most advisable for me ?
okay so i 've had this g2 on verizon for probably over two years now and it has been rooted since day one i got it and i 've tried many different roms in that time and was at bootstack 39a and sometime before that i had done a hard reset with flash tool before so i 've seen some things and i 've been through a few android phones with root on this unlimited data plan of mine .
but just recently within the last week a few days ago when i was using my g2 as a mobile hotspot as i 've done almost daily forever the damn tethering stopped and mobile hotspot '' went out on me .
the toggle switch would grey out and even if i tried connecting my g2 to wifi it would just say turning on ... '' and never click on .
oh and i kept getting the unfortunately bluetooth share has stopped '' pop-up which i still do n't know what brought that on .
so i tried installing different roms and twrp backups i had and still everything would not allow me to use mobile hotspot or wifi or bluetooth .
after looking through the menus in the networking areas i noticed that my wifi mac address '' and bluetooth address were both listed as unavailable '' .
googling issues involving unavailable mac addesses on android phones usually resulted in send it in for warranty replacement '' pretty much across the board .
somewhere along the line of installing roms i messed up and got an error in bootup .
i tried the flash tool unbricking guide and i could n't get my phone to connect or the software to upload .
then after a day away from it i looked some more guides up and found a guide using the 2014 version of flash tool .
i plugged my phone in my pc got to download mode and tried the 2014 flash tool and surprisingly it worked .
i was now back on stock 4.2.2 android on my g2 .
my data was working i was unrooted and mobile hotspot wanted me to give verizon 30 .
so i rooted the phone again using ioroot and then found the hotspotrevision.apk replacement from xda that removes the verizon interception and holy moly i am tethering again connecting my laptop and an iphone 5 via wifi from the g2 .
i decided to install flashify twrp and made a backup .
everything ran smooth for about 3 hours or so and then my internet cut off .
sure enough mobile hotspot cut off and wo n't reconnect and wifi bluetooth wo n't connect and once again contain unavailable mac addesses .
i attempted to restore my twrp backup from a few hours prior and succeeded but still all the wifi and bluetooth signals are shot .
i was thinking in the meantime maybe i should buy another used g2 off ebay or maybe even a used nexus 6 but now i 'm concerned over if this issue is on the phone end or the verizon network end .
i 've been using the same sim card ever since owning this phone in case that 's a factor or not .
tl dr unlimited data verizon user hotspot died mac addresses unavailable '' .
factory reset fixed the problem then hours later problem reappeared .

ok so is there a way to request a forge map to be made in the community ?
i remember years ago there was a website where you could make forge blueprints for halo 3 for yourself .
is there some sort of way to make them now ?
multiple pages of blueprint would represent different elevated layers on the map ... or maybe you can make a single page that clearly shows which parts are elevated if easier that way .
i was thinking maybe people who want to make maps but want to rely on others to make their idea for them if they think they are bad at forge do n't have the time etc .
can make blueprints and submit them and have someone or multiple people forge their version of the blueprint in their free time .
maybe a place where you can write a detailed description and get a surprise forge made for you ?
or maybe there could be a lomg competition where forgers have to make 10 requested descriptions of requested maps and their game types .
the best maps are fearured and the best overall forger becomes the winner .
i only use a small section or corner of the washcloth for the toweling off step so 3/4 of the washcloth stays dry .
each time i wash my face i use a clean corner until i 've used the washcloth 4 times .
usually there 's a bit of makeup residue left on the corners that wo n't completely rinse off so it 's easy to tell which sides i 've used already .
a little less laundry than using a clean one only 1 time .

or as seen in the movie carrie behaving like her being stood up at the alter was worse and more important over miranda 's husband cheating on her .
they all babied her and comforted her even spoon feeding her when she would n't get out of bed for three days straight .
pretty much leaving miranda to deal with her shit on her own .
all she seemed to get from them was that sucks . ''
that shit bothered me the most in the movie .
mr. big was n't exactly known for his faithfulness .
he was constantly in and out of carrie 's life like i want you .
he was afraid of commitment more so than carrie imo .
so him standing up carrie at the alter while still a shit thing to do to someone should n't have come as a surprise .
ffs they even cheated with each other while seeing other people !
mr. big was married during their cheating escapades too .
i literally called ... let me pull up my list ... 28 different places 20 places directly and eight separate insurance brokers and the only offers i got were extremely expensive 80/month and required my room mates to also purchase the insurance .

i feel like a lot of the stuff in acok was added late grrm wrote much of agot and acok together all originally for what was to be the first volume of the trilogy .
late in the game he realized it would have to be more so he included things that led to future arcs .
the most standout 'late addition ' to me is reek/ramsay who can be omitted entirely from theon 's arc as we saw in the show when they adapted it .
it just became theon 's own choice something he did at he urging of one of his ironborn .
also a lot of the house of the undying feels like it was written to give him options vague metaphorical prophecies that can be anything he writes for them to be .
for 119 that 's insanely inexpensive i should check reviews he would love this thing .
i use them for some paths in the garden and it is his preferred place to go probably some other cats as well .
for the life of me i do n't understand why anyone would consider the ipad pro to be a compelling product .
unless you 're an apple fanboy it makes absolutely no sense to pay a premium laptop price for a device that lacks the versatility of a laptop and that does n't even let you access its file system .
relatedly the ipad pro is definitive proof that apple has jumped the shark .
could you ever imagine apple so blatantly copying a microsoft concept five years ago without shedding any of the limitations that make the ipad ill-suited to be a laptop replacement ?

it 's a well orchestrated illusion that jail in the usa is rehabilitative .
this article is from the uk but has similar statistics to the usa http www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ampp3d-from-mirror/prison-doesnt-work-50-time-3748230 the figures are pretty dismal .
implementing systemic change in the way society treats offenders is something that will take a very long time .
so what is there to be done in crisis situations in the meantime ?
imagine a family member you cared about was living beside those people and junior '' was threatening them with a gun or repeatedly stealing from their vehicle as happened to the uploader of the video .
obviously the police are n't taking action or they would all already have been in jail since they are shown committing arrestable offences daily .
would you not want the person you cared about to have a solution immediately not years or decades from now ?
suddenly the solution is more complicated than some people are presenting it as is n't it ?

you can just map the buttons to the xbox controller pick a game cube title though it 's probably the most similar controller
it also helps that the carrier of dengue chikungunya and zyka is the aedes aegypty and not all mosquitoes .
also it depends on your purpose for going into public beta .
you might consider doing so if you feel like the core mechanics of the game fairly ready and you are looking for feedback on how it plays so that you can make adjustments and tighten up the game .
but at the same time you do n't want to had people something that is too buggy or unplayable because they 'll leave with a bad taste in their mouth and wo n't be likely to suggest it to their friends and wo n't be as keen on future updates on the game .
they 're just banned from pushing an agenda like they were doing with dog bite statistics a few years back .
the problem is that the ban is a ban on research that comes to any conclusion that could be construed as pushing gun regulation .
so it is effectively a ban on research because unless they know the outcome of a study ahead of time they ca n't research it .
just like how there is no gun show loophole '' because everyone selling at the gun show proper has to be a dealer .
and there is no internet loophole '' because guns sold and shipped have to go through a licensed dealer .
note how they leave out it is perfectly legal to negotiate a person to person transaction in either place then actually exchange the guns and money face to face in the parking lot with no check .
if all they want is to know if it 's a doctor or nurse issue they could ask if you want to see a doctor or a nurse .
you might not know what you want or you might not want to tell everyone about it .
it took around 5 hours to beat the game my first time around so i 'd definitely say he did n't get far enough in .

are you saying that kobe should be forced to quit basketball because of this comment you do n't understand ?

wolf may be more or less of a semi-clone but it 's a big overstatement to say they 're exactly the same .
that 's the problem we just do n't know .
i am pretty sure there 's people in most factions doing it and many of them are justifying in the sense that it 's ok to employ the same tactic as is being used against them but i do believe the majority of players in powerplay enjoy the honest competitiveness .

rossi has been at the level below formula 1 since 2011 .
he came into the season with 32 gp2 starts to his name and a further 35 in formula renault 3.5 .
any attempts to twist him as some sort of rookie or in any way inexperienced this year is just plain wrong .
the most impressive year of his career was 2011 he then stagnated for three years putting in mediocre results in gp2 a grand total of 4 podiums in those 32 races for a couple of years before finding the right mix of team and experience to do well last year .
not saying he does n't deserve credit but saying that his junior record 'proves ' that he deserves an f1 seat is a bit of a stretch because its not really any better than a lot of other drivers and they ca n't all get a seat .
he spent most of his career bar a couple of years firmly in the upper midfield in various categories with brief forays to the front on occasion .
rossi is one of those drivers whom it would n't be a travesty to see getting an f1 seat but it also would n't be a travesty to see him never start another gp either .
cm is my most comfortable hero but i am hesitant to first pick her because so many heroes can feed off her low hp and movement .
my skill build is usually 1 point frostbite then 2 mana and then maxing q .
gives everyone a good mana regen her a way to farm jungle and the q is great for ganking and clearing waves .
i tend to go tranquils because she really needs the movement speed and with so little hp it makes it important to be a 100 all the time .
i either go drum or point booster early on to supplement her low hp and mana pool .
starting items usually are tangos courier 2 wards mana pot ring of protection and fill rest up with smoke or branches .
come to think of it though i might have to try treads/veil on her instead at some point .
provides the hp regen hp armour and a damage bonus .
i do n't consider aether lens to be a good pickup for her .

that you think there are other ways to the truth '' is a common enough occurence caused by people never learning how to think .

i specifically booed on a crucial third down play when manning could have hobbled for the first and instead forced a pass thirty yards down field into double coverage leading to the drive stalling .
that was a hot topic of discussion that week in denver and the reason many broncos fans are iffy on the guy to this day .
if someone has a bad day play with those whom also has a bad day instead of ruining those having a good day .
the fact is the environment there is n't that bad not worse than your average game that happened to have someone flaming .
the only problem is if you have enough player in the pool which should not be a problem for lol .

i imagine the wiiu game pad actually being very useful .
to be able to manage your inventory or have a map on it continually .
my latest idea was that samsung re-designs the gear vr to have a metal faceplate instead of plastic and the metal also flows around the inside of the gearvr up and near the ears and down on the bottom just a thick stripe of metal that 's connected to the metal faceplate .
then whatever phone you sit in the gearvr the heat conducts against the metal and spreads throughout the gearvr dissipating it into your face to keep your warm in cold climates or in winter .
in summer a fan can be used that sucks the air inward and blows it out the bottom channeling the heat away from your face .
in other words just spread the heat from the phone over a larger surface area so that the phone 's heat is being drawn out and spread out over a larger volume of space .
that would keep the phone 's top temperatures a lot lower by sharing the heat with the gearvr .
this would have the additional effect of having the gearvr become fog free '' since the reason fogging occurs is that you are putting a cold device against a warm face creating condensation fog .
but if the device is pre-warmed by contact from your phone there wo n't be any fogging anymore .
and it would only cost samsung a few dollars more per phone to manufacture the extra metal into the hmd .
one caveat is the s6 is made of glass on the back so a special metal cover would need to be made to capture the heat coming out and help it transfer to the gearvr .
this case would now cause the s6 to fit in the gearvr by adjusting the sliding usb dock to the largest setting instead of the smaller one .

alphys states in the true lab entries i did it !
using the blueprints i managed to extract it '' which means that all of the blueprints she used was gaster 's .
which leads me to assume that either chara hated everyone because she was experimented on by gaster and she 's the reason sans lost everything or that chara is a homonculus created by gaster that can see and extract determination from fountains in the underground save points and is far more resilient than any other human simply because she 's a determination powerhouse otherwise the rest of the children would 've never died assuming that they could always replenish their determination .
btw gaster followers never tell you to which one of his creations fell into .

steam guard was mandatory for trading for a looong time already
the game is great but you have to know what you 're getting into .
i assume the 59 on steam is mainly from people who have experienced many of the performance problems which you may or may not experience .
the game is littered with stuttering crashing and all around stability problems but these problems only occur for some people on certain systems .
many people like myself have n't seen any problems other than the occasional freeze or stutter which is n't a huge deal .
now i may sound really negative towards the game but im still going to recommend you buy the game and give it a go because as it stands i have played 112hrs i 've only played 60hrs of boii and i still adore the game .
it 's done what aw wanted to do but ultimately failed at while still remaining grounded within the franchise .
so my recommendation is to read up on all the problems and their associated fixes buy the game play for an hour or so and see if you like it .
if you dont steam refund it and put the money else where .
tl dr game has performance problems but is still amazing .
buy the game being fully aware of its flawless and be prepared to refund the game if need be .
i was experiencing lots of issues on ios 9.0.2 as well .

importantly you could have used smc after the run is completed.
there are a total of 4 paid ability windows in which you could have done so before they get to spend a single click .
before you discard after you discard before their mandatory draw and after their mandatory draw.
edit totally forgot that ghost runner is only usable mid run .
if you wanted to use ghost runner credits for smc then since you are the active player you get to act first in any paid ability windows meaning you have the opportunity to use smc before they can rez and use jackson but if you do not use smc before priority is passed in a rez window then the corp may rez and use jackson at which point it is too late .
loki is better at stealth than ash thanks to longer invisibility and decoy teleport makes moving around the map and through traps a piece of cake .
ash p is a lot tankier than loki p .
loki is the cc god of warframe he is extremely beneficial in the form of crowd control and can easily revive allies thanks to invisibility .
ash does not have crowd control and he barely does anything to a team other than being an excellent killer and reviver .
ash is an assassin meant to be nowhere and everywhere at the same time backstabbing heavies and bladestorming crowds .
loki is meant to make sure he and the squad will never ever get hit thanks to him permanently removing all enemies weapons and also enraging enemies making them attack each other thanks to his augment .
loki is the better choice when comparing usability but i personally think that ash prime is more fun since you constantly utilize all of his abilities and you always need to be on the move he 's a very hectic frame .

a few years ago 2012 new zealand moved https www.consumer.org.nz/articles/credit-reports article-reporting-the-positive from only allowing a negative only rating system only tracks unpaid debts etc to allowing a positive '' system like they have in the us tracks paid-off debts time taken to repay etc .
in the us people are focused on building '' a good positive credit rating by taking on debt and paying it off which until 2012 would have made no sense under the nz system .
i think we 're still yet to really see the results of this change .
well that attitude is n't going to help anyone .
sure this sub has problems but why not try to fix it like i do ?
although he did say you were like jesus so ... .i guess that was nice of him .
i doubt it 's that we are having less in-depth conversations .
that seems hard to prove and unlikely to change the use of definite articles .
if i were to take a guess it is probably due to the rise of proper nouns being generalized .
proper nouns do not take on a definite article because they are already specified .
and with the rise of corporations and branding ans the like proper nouns have become very ubiquitous .
that also seems to be a trend of taking proper nouns and making them general google is used as a verb coke is used to mean any kind of soda pop etc. .
this could explain the shift away from definite articles .
but i have no data on this so please take it with a grain of salt .

it 's always fun to think about the fact that a recurring character could go through so many alterations retaining certain iconic elements .
anyway i agree with a lot of people who mention that the fates anna is great she really is and is quite possibly my favourite but just going off of those shared in the picture here my top three would be
i think it 's the way her ponytail is designed that really wins me over on this one .

however i truly adore the way she 's designed as both the merchant and apotheosis forms although the blue haired kimono wearing hot spring scramble one is great as well .

there 's something just flat out pleasant about her design for por .

okay so i 've been working out for a good bit now 7 months and my goal has been to get stronger then drop bf to get a nice base then get on a typical cut/bulk cycle and work at being happy with my body .
i started out at 216lbs yikes and have diligently worked down to 170lbs without losing much strength .
lifts are bench 195x5 ohp 105x5 deadlift 245x5 squat 215x5 i do seem to be losing strength now squats and deads are down a bit .
did sl5x5 for 12 weeks followed program religiously then switched to ppl 6 days a week which i enjoy very much .
i 'm 5'6 '' male 43 years old and currently weigh 170lbs .
bf estimates with calipers and tape have me at a 13 average .
in my opinion i 'm looking good and stomach muscles are starting to peak out .
okay so here 's where i need some guidance .
i 've been cutting for months at 1500 calories and not only have i hit a weight lose plateau i also just plain feel like crap day in and day out now .
i want to increase my intake but worried i 'll undo all my hard work but i want size and gains too .
my macros are c30/p45/f25 and i weigh and measure food religiously .
but i can not seem to bump under 170lbs and the constant feeling like crap is starting to hamper my motivation .
should i go to maintenance for a little while to balance out ?
some peers at the gym are telling me that my deficit is too low and that i would still drop bf at a slightly higher intake and just be patient and let the process happen..
i always figured girls would see this type of guy as a player and would n't be interested ?
i grew up in a very strait environment surrounded by strait guys and i turned out pretty strait after all of that i am gay though i promise
i moved out of that town and made some pretty dope friends in a new larger slightly more open minded environment .
3ish years ago i eventually became comfortable enough to let everyone in on my little secret ...
it was quite a shock for everyone at first because nothing about me or my lifestyle seems to fit the stereotypes but they were all very supportive and i kinda found the whole 'coming out ' thing a bit underwhelming considering how much i stressed about it .
which is much better then the alternative i suppose .
so now im a gay 23 year old dude with the support of everyone around me and for the first time ever it looks like that i might have found a cutey thats willing to put up with me and i am currently shitting myself !
i have never been in a mutual relationship before let alone felt this way about someone and been able to actively pursue them .
i mean i ca n't even describe to you guys the way he makes me feel !
i get so nervous before seeing him every time i think about him i get butterflies !
it 's an amazing feeling and after spending some time with him i ca n't wipe the smile off my face for days !
since he is the first guy i 've ever let myself feel this way about i do n't want to jump the gun and say he is the one but for now i could make him my world in a heartbeat and spend the rest of my happy days making sure he has everything he could ever want for .
since i have never really been in a relationship before or anything remotely close i honestly have no idea what it is i 'm supposed to be doing !
he sends me hints all the time to come over and they literally go strait over my head !
he finds it cute now but im worried that if i do n't pick up my game he is gon na find someone else .
i feel this way because i lack the self confidence to even put myself in the same league as him !
i honestly can not for the life of me figure out how a guy as perfect as he is would fall for a scraggy laid back normalish guy like me !
i ca n't move forward in this relationship because i ca n't get past my own insecurities .
how do i let go and just commit fully to something like this ?
have any of you guys got some advice here ?
i got nothin.. im gon na continue to go with the flow and see what happens but he is in complete control at the moment !
i 'm powerless around him yet i get the vibe he wants me to step up a bit .
i 'm a 23 year old out gay dude thats never been in love or in a relationship before until now and i need some help figuring it all out .
i found a guy for the first time in my life and he makes me happier than i thought possible yet i feel he is way too good for me and for that reason i feel like im gon na loose him so im struggling to commit fully .
308 warlock lookong for a group or trying to put together a group to do the normal raid with challenge !
just so y'all know new list is as follows i 'm quite happy with it i tend to go 4-0 at fnm most weeks so tonight was n't a huge surprise when i ended up 4-0 but i definitely felt more confident and in control during the games wingmate was huge in the sideboard too hopefully i can find an event to take it to before gatewatch comes in haha
hey all a while ago i posted about my bant megamorph list and trying to fine tune it i ended up returning to flat g/w because it just seems so much more reliable and curves out so nicely .
now my main issue is against abzan any other popular archetype is fine for me but i just ca n't seem to get around them exiling all my threats and just shoving damage across .
i 've just recently re-added evolutionary leap to my sideboard for matchups with heavy single target removal but i 'm yet to be able to test it out .
the idea was that evo leap would be able to help me vs abzan since i can just sac my raptors when they try to exile or any creature really only problem there is that it does n't help when anafenza is in play .
i 'm on 3 main board silkwraps though along side 3 sideboard valorous stance so i can usually answer her .
i bring in the valorous stance vs abzan and will now also be bringing in evo leap
this is by far the hardest matchup for me some may think otherwise and i 'm really struggling on all points of the board here so if anyone has some tips for how i can tackle the deck i 'm all ears .
i 've been in the premier league as farnborough for about 10 seasons now .

last night i just randomly went into the basement and saw that my boiler was leaking water .
after a closer investigation i saw that it was my cartridge circulator .
last night the leak was very slow and now since the heat was on all night it has gotten faster but still a bucket is doing the trick .
i was wondering what seems to be the problem and how can i fix it ?
i want to fix it my self because it does not seem to hard according to other findings on google .
it seems like the leak is coming from the cartridge .

just how would you react to finding out about someone having you in the metaphorical spank bank '' so to speak ?
does your reaction differ if the person envisioning you is attractive to you or not ?
i ask because i got into a discussion with a girl friend who casually mentioned she 's thought about me amongst many other people once or twice in the past when masturbating and attributes it simply to fantasies which come and go to which i admitted i had done also .
our other friend joined the conversation and stated eww that 's just wrong ! ''
before stating it 's like a less serious mix of voyeurism and non-consensual sex .
needless to say the conversation got pretty heated and we agreed to drop it soon after .
edit if you want to see the male reactions to this question you 'll have to go over to askmen .
i did post a link however have been informed it was against the rules of r/askwomen and thus has been removed .

i first heard the phrase what a time to be alive '' during the gt-fsu college football game this past october and since then i see it everywhere .
after doing some research i see that the original reference is from the simpsons .
i 'm curious if the gt-fsu game had an impact on the usage of the term or if it 's an example of the baader-meinhof phenomenon .
this might be a simple request and if it is i am sorry but i am genuinely curious about the frequency of the term and the impact of different events .
playing with someone who is always thinking on min/max level i give them some gold he try to find every way to buy or trade for boost i give them a base he try to turn it into a one making franchise he wants to use any and every item and person to gain power i get wanting to be the best you can be and so far i 've curbed it from effecting the other players too much but i 'm afraid that later levels the not so agresive players will start fading back due to the min/max tactics .
i just do n't wan na have to confront him and say hey stop trying to play your knightly power driven pc so powerful ? ''

i was just playing a competitive match with some friends .
we were just messing around having fun and my friend stole my kill .
at this point i had n't done any other tk damage .
so later my friend was crouching on my head taking a shit as your friends do sometimes and i could n't move .
naturally i took out my deagle and shot him in the head and i got banned for tk damage .
at this point i literally had n't done any team damage except for killing him once so i got banned for only doing 2 tks .
this has happened a couple other times as well with various situations .
i 'm wondering if anyone else is having this issue ?
2016 will be my best friend 's and my first bonnaroo .
we are both college age girls looking to have fun and make friends .
we chose bonnaroo over other festivals we did lolla ga in 2014 because of the positive vibe of unity the festival-goers seem to create .
we chose to go vip because of the creature comforts and the shorter wait time caused by separate highway entrance .
we wo n't know anyone else on the farm and we are now aware of the older average age in vip we 're 21 .
we really want to chill and maybe group up to see shows .
is there maybe going to be a r/bonnaroo kickback in vip or ga ?
we were thinking about posting or yakking closer to the fest days to look for other kids in vip looking to hang .
i am also becoming concerned that vip may be too closed off and less of a party atmosphere .
we know we can always go into ga camping for that but i was thinking it would be weird without our own tent in ga .
anyways i know this is wordy but really any advice or tips would be appreciated .
tl dr college girls are concerned vip camping is going to be lame and we may not make friends .

proverbs 9:7 if you correct conceited people you will only be insulted .
if you reprimand evil people you will only get hurt .
8 never correct conceited people they will hate you for it .
but if you correct the wise they will respect you .
9 anything you say to the wise will make them wiser .
whatever you tell the righteous will add to their knowledge .
think about this before you get into internet arguments .
besides other scripture that says not to argue some people argue just to win the argument over learning anything .
you can tell who reasons and who just off the cuff instant responds .
wise people can learn but conceited people just feel an argument is a sort of fight they want to win .

so years ago i came across this clip from kazaa or something and it was of this brunette woman on a message table .
then the male masseuse of course got closer to her pussy .
i distinctly remember the dialogue it 's just a tool '' as he sticks his dick in her the first time and she responds that 's a pretty big tool . ''
after a minute or so she realizes it 's his dick and they keep going .

take a look at the real clear politics polling data http www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html .
consider the latest monthly average for people who thought we were moving in the right direction or think that we are on the wrong track
wrong track 65.8 45 r 's and 20 d 's
the right direction '' dems will be more likely to vote for hillary than bernie .
the wrong track '' dems are voting for change so they will be more likely to feel the bern .
that averages out to about 20-24 points for both hillary and bernie .
here is where it gets interesting the wrong track '' r voters will mostly vote for a republican but the ones that will choose a democrat they will more likely choose the bern .
what i am trying to point out is that i think this shows an overall leaning towards bernie .
this is by no means a professional analysis so i hope to hear your thoughts on other interpretations

popped into chemist warehouse the other day as they 're still having their 50 off sale going on .
quite a few items i wanted to pick up were sold out however i still got some little goodies .
if you guys have any recommendations from the brands that chemist warehouse carries l'oreal rimmel maybelline revlon ... please let me know i 'm keen to try out new things !
‚Ä¢ meteoric matte dark purpley-red almost appears to be brown in some lighting .
again very comfortable to wear with a velvet semi-matte finish .
38 a little similar to the apocalips in atomic rose but not matte and much more creamier .
again a peachy nude which could have a possible tendency to wash people with a lighter complexion out for reference i 'm between nw25-30 .
37 a bright lady-bug red with warm-slightly orangey undertones .
to me this is an easy no-fuss goes-with-pretty-much-everything red .
its got a creamy texture but still manages to cling onto your lips without slipping off 5 minutes after applying .
‚Ä¢ maybelline master sculpt contour powder in medium/dark the contour powder has decent colour payoff however the highlighter seems to be a bit chalky maybe i got an odd one .
probably got ta try this baby a little more to finally form a proper opinion on it .
‚Ä¢ l'oreal true match foundation in warm beige quite yellow based medium coverage dewy foundation .
probably the most decent drugstore foundation i 've tried so far as i find colour matching among more affordable foundations to be quite frustrating .
staying power is average 5-6 hours maybe gets a little oily after a while but does not oxidise too bad on me .
‚Ä¢ heaps of rimmel they have the best nail polish applicator ever nice broad rounded applicator and sally hansen nail polishes .
again please let me know what you bought from the numerous sales going on and whether or not you 'd recommend it .

and yes i know its ultimately up to me and this is highly opinionated but i want to hear what people think .
i always liked a nice black car but the metallic in the dark grey looks really nice as well .
metallic may help hide dings and scratches in the long run .
prob gon na get some rally armor mud flaps to help
there is always something awesome about that smooth black on a car though .
the limited has the grey wheels so that may make the difference .
does clearing the pod after every use prolong the life of the machine due to releasing built up of pressure .
i initially thought my s3 was doing fine but looking at the battery stats i can see wi-fi is top of the pile with almost half of the battery usage even with a 4300mah battery !
i 've read numerous threads about wi-fi battery issues/bugs in marshmallow and tried every tip .
bought a new car and our family is going to soon outgrow the car .
i 'm also looking at an older car to help store stash away some extra money .
i 'm guessing i will be in the 16,000-18,000 range but would feel a bit more comfortable getting somewhere closer to 20k .
all i did was click the link and log into nfl.com .
i was already logged in so i just went straight to the competition page and was instantly credited .
i played anyways since i like fantasy but i got it before adding a player to my lineup i believe .
edit 2 reports of it being patched are confirmed .
people have reported the inability to go otr as part of the latest glitch where the minimap would n't disappear when they spectated someone else playing golf .
people claimed the only fix was a new profile but thanks to u/derp-de-doop posting a solution he tried in the second thread i was able to do the otr glitch so this could be a fix .
if you have 2 you 'll need to delete one .
recommended to have a friend because no one joins the lts at the end .
proceed with the glitch as normal and it should put you off the radar .
i see natsu having more brute power and zuko being more skilled but far less powerful .

after finishing 'hoard of the dragon queen ' we 've moved on with the same characters to 'rise of tiamat ' the second part of the tyranny of dragons storyline .
this week after following a group of harper captives to a pirate ship the group is mid-combat with the drow pirates who kidnapped them .

i think i 'm finally understanding you guys now .
correct me if i 'm wrong but the term feminist is used too broadly because modern feminists have poisoned everything so deeply that they have in fact forever poisened the term it self .
this is not do discredit important social movements of the past like women 's suffrage women 's rights to an education or any past efforts for women to be equal bucause modern feminists have already done that by carrying the same banner but with a whole different cause .
sort of like how madonna wont call herself a feminist or how nazism ruined the symbol of the swastika for other cultures that have been using it long before the nazis ever existed ?

i 'm 37 weeks tomorrow ftm and due on the 26th of january .
the holidays pretty much just went by like a breeze and now the only major event coming up is the baby 's arrival !
i 've always been scared of having a baby since i was a kid .
when i got pregnant i thought i came to terms with my fears but now as my due date draws near i ca n't help but feel all levels of anxiety .
i 'm not sure how i will handle labour and how i will take care of my child .
part of me ca n't wait to meet this little guy inside of me but the other part of me is sort of hating myself for even getting pregnant in the first place .
so and i did n't plan to have a baby till we 're 30 .
the nursery is as ready as it could be but i 'm not !
i do n't know what to do to relieve myself of my anxiety .
time seems to go by super slow and nothing interests me right now to pass it .
i do n't want to watch tv i ca n't sleep i do n't want to read my books .
i feel like i 'm about to go crazy !
the only thing that seems to help right now are the post partum stories and advice on babybumps .
i 'm looking into using amlactin as an everyday lotion .
i 've heard that it 's good for exfoliating the skin and moisturizing .
has anyone had experience with it and does it work well ?
i was traveling back to school and stopped to sleep at a family friend 's house .
i brought my pc inside but forgot my h80 that i have not yet installed .
the weather was about 20¬∞f and it stayed in my car overnight .
if som is there a way i can test for it ?
if this is n't the right sub i 'm sorry .
self sacrifice starts you off with your retaliator already sapped so you can immediately begin to set up without needing to wait for hellbiter to hit you .
as an added bonus you will also retaliate on every cast of hellbiter giving you extra damage .
since yunalesca uses holy magic breakdown wo n't do anything since holy is mnd based .
bring shellga if you want to resist her magic attacks .
she will dispel shellga/protectga/haste but only on her single target physical attacks .
therefore using drawtaliate with gilgamesh allows you to ignore her dispel entirely .
keep in mind that my setup assumes extremely good gear with a good amount of rs .
rw was advance sazh has boon y'shtola has stoneskin ii .
yuna also has hymn of the fayth but you do n't want to use that sb in this fight and she did n't even get enough gauge to use it anyway .
if you do n't think you can kill yunalesca in that time you might want to let your retaliator take one hellbiter so sap does n't wear off .
my watch rolex oyster perpetual was on a watch winder for two weeks whilst i was out of town .
i took it off to wear this morning and noticed the time was off it was behind by more than an hour .
i reset the time around 9:30 am and gave it a few winds to make sure it was wound up .
by noon it was ahead by about 15 minutes .
after a couple more hours it was ahead by about 10 minutes and appeared to be staying that way .
i reset the time again at around 3:30 pm a bit more than 4 hours later it appears to be keeping time normally .
anyone else ever have this happen and should i be concerned ?
the watch is less than a year old so i do n't think it would require servicing yet .
i love this sub and i 'm on mobile and this title only took 17 tries to type and i only accidentally activated google voice keyboard twice .

so i 'm trying to find my way through the competitive scene and was wondering what the weekly tournaments in california were ?
the purpose of this thread is to gain more recognition for this bug so that hopefully we can get to the bottom of this .
here 's what it looks like https i.imgur.com/q1nxupe.jpg credit to trazati .
i 've posted about this problem in this thread on the official tech support forum http us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/19974038041 .
i found this post from a year ago https www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/2gr9w9/error_unable_to_load_score_screen and also this post from a year ago https www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/2n4mhm/score_screen_bug_still_not_fixed .
but i have n't found much recently about it .
myself and all of my friends have this problem on about 90 of match history games that we try to view .
i 've had the problem for about a year .
there does n't seem to be any pattern as to which games work load the history and which ones do n't .
the one thing that we all have in common is that we are in australia and play on north america .
please help spread the word if you have this problem .
if you want to play the game i can give you a game key provided that you use my recruitment code .
we are playing inspired and pertinent defense right now .
if we limit penalties and do n't have costly turnovers we can handle any team .
people seem to constantly forget that serial was conceived simply as long form storytelling not just a podcast version of unsolved mysteries .
the only reason for jail is that you do n't run away while waiting for your trial .
setting a bail insures that you will show up again because else a big chunk of money is gone and most people rather do n't want that .
have n't got any ticket from the event yet orzz .
anyway i 'm going to make sure not to slip out of t2 this time .
i have a brother in law in la im from scotland if i may be over in the summer id take you to lunch
svanna far-shield has a thing for sibbi black-briar though .
i wish erick the slayer was marriageable in vanilla he is such sweetie and seems like the only mercenary you can't wed .
my point is if you visited the 1600s the idea of a united germany would seem as far as iraq making it now even with institutions in place as the hre .
i 'm sick and tired of people deciding that iraqis or syrians or any other people need babysitting and that it 's best to keep them isolated or ruled by a dictator .
it 's demeaning and there 's the undertone of thinking less of them and treat them like unruly children .
the irony is that many people do that to spite early 20th century colonialist policy but in the end their behavior is similar .
there 's room for intervention but it can be facilitating peace talks or actually protecting and caring for the people in need instead of playing petty politics over the middle east like a chessboard .
do n't get me wrong i 'm not directing the above to you you 're making compelling arguments and actual dialogue .
in the end ignoring the intricacies of the middle east would do as much a disservice to its people as forgetting about their wishes .
1 of those sacred geometries for your first time must 've been incredible !
it 's a good time for free activities around here .
these are marketing people i believe they do n't know everything about the device i 'm waiting for there to be more proper information to be released .

it made me around 1,500 a month for quite awhile until the hamsterdance.com dude decided he had created something bigger than a stupid page with animated gifs and broke away from our dumb ring of dancing websites .
traffic dwindled i stopped paying attention to it the company that hosted and owned the domain tilted media apparently went out of business and let the domain expire .
someone else swooped in and bought it and is keeping it going for some stupid reason .
i tried to work with the new owner as they stole a bunch of original images that a friend of mine created for the site but they did n't respond .
when the new was released i used a olive green theme for a a year .
valve could set it as a option to use as a layout .
x i had to check and you 're right what i actually meant was demolition .
one is the team deathmatch mode where you need to get kills with different weapons and end the game with a knife kill .
the other one is the 5v5 defusal mode where you spawn with a set weapon for that round until you get a kill then you spawn with a new weapon for the next round .
in 2nd grade my art was selected to be displayed in our cities art gallery .
we were supposed to draw one of the pages from our favourite book but instead i did an original one in the style of eric carle actually i was just too lazy to go through his books and pick a page .
it was of a frog i ca n't remember which book it was out of and i did a whole paper mache swamp !
boston residents certainly are n't friendly but they 're not really rude either .
mostly they ignore everyone else until they ca n't .
what 's worse is maintaining python code written with semi-colons .
it sucks because i never want to add them but i have to for consistency
seems like we never hear anything about lsv 's personal life by choice i 'm sure .
i did n't even know he was married until recently .
this is very well written and makes a lot of sense logically and emotionally .
the thing i ca n't stand with all these fan theories and i 'm sure we will hear even more retarded fan theories in the future is that they all miss the most important detail to both jj and kasden and anyone else involved .
this theory makes a very strong and compelling story !
that 's why i think it 's the best .
and also ya know the evidence granted most of it is theory/circumstantial .
ok fair enough yes as a good player in theory you should win more games..
but you play in a team based game mode you must take reponsability for your team no matter how bad they are meaning you can be a monster but if your w/l will reflect your team .
if you want to win so bad and not rely on ass tier teammates maybe try ffa imo that game mode is sorta dumb but it is an option .
if not try to find one decent person whom you dont need to talk to and party up with them and hopefully they can make that difference that would usually lose you the game .
also by playing solo you are activly lowering your chances of winning .
if you really want to win you would party up .
unless you party up you will always be at a disadvantage even if they have sbmm .
seems like you want the win without the social team aspect cod 101 rule never trust in the green guys cus 99 of the time they may as well be a bad guy .
intact sensor had failure code split open and corroded sensor still reading normally .
i think you are using too many things at once .
try evening the load between two arduino and make them communicate using i2c or serial
did your post have anything at all to do with the current pve ?
you should have used magnetic flux for your joke post so people can relate
1st na beta is over has been for weeks .
2nd na beta has yet to be announced but it will be a closed beta .
so buy a key with the 50 package or win a key from the events .
date of release for the na version yet to be announced .
my guess is the first video went for broadcast on a tv show then later to youtube .
let 's not forget there is lots of camera work too .
mainly i just wanted to provide an immediate ear-comparison .
even if the first video is a board feed to me it sounds all choked and thin .
there is no sense of authority in the mix of the star performer .
it is like the toms are in the background or something .
it just trips me out how clinical it is the sound of the mixer .
would be interesting to know what mixing console was used if the innate sound is a hardware thing or engineering thing .
afterthought if it is a board feed that might explain some of lack of blend and balance of the mix .
in other words if the tom are acoustically strong in the room then less of them at fader .
yeah it 's possible just do n't request a larger recruitment network .
honestly when i did it i just save scummed the whole thing and even then it was difficult as fuck i was so frustrated .
but they ca n't fund the game through ks with the adult content in it so it 's all hush-hush for now .
the plan as of now is a physical edition with a patch you can download that adds the 18 content .
our partner company mikandi in the us will be implementing that .
their team is very experienced in patching games so it will be simple and convenient .
i think the key to buying a condo though is to look at how the condo fees are being spent and saved and really understand the reserve fund and ongoing plan for maintenance .
always make sure there 's a recent third party assessment of the corporation and its finances .

blm calls them terrorists because they want everyone to hate them as much as they hate all white people but the alleged terrorists have n't actually done anything that qualifies them as terrorists .
would be great but it 's too subtle and intricate to be correct
nah cruz 's fight to lose '' means that he should win and he has to fuck up to lose it .
in other words if he loses it 's because he did something wrong not because tj is better .
unfortunately or fortunately depending on your viewpoint the way the system is designed make decisions like that very rare .
just because someone is really smart in one area does n't mean they 're smart in other areas .
it was viable enough to be played in a tournament .
i actually ran into a situation where i would have loved this two days ago .

we 've had an 18 month engagement and are planning across the country so we 've had some serious spurts of activity and then months of nothing .
during those downtime months i actually built in do not talk about wedding things '' on date nights weekends and holidays .
i also picked up some crafting hobbies not for wedding !
and have invested too much time on online shopping for winter dog coats we have a bulldog that instagrams.. got ta keep him sharp .
nothing wrong with celebrating the natural lulls with avoiding wedding things for a bit !
i was at mosport superbike in 1982 when suzuki did a parade lap with the new katana .

i mean i know a 1300 that is absolute trash like he is garbage and he was doing an elo he lost and still got banned .
as a 16 year and counting army vet i am floored at the things you come up with !
while it may lose some synergy with deathwatch/grasp i think it would be more valuable for the class as a whole for it to act as a dispel effect .
if you really need the deathwatch effect then ritual banishing is generally better and in a deathwatch deck you should n't have an issue keeping at least one extra wraithling/sarlac or other small body around to use it .
obligatory not racist but.. hang on have i found a non racist way of using that term‚ÄΩ
racists and the far right tend to have lower iq 's .

true it is n't but the swedish government did mess up in their decision for free asylum and their rescinding of that decision along with their border control is ultimately the reason for danish border control .
do n't say that model designation or we 're all gon na have to sit through those stupid copy pasta posts about ground speed and how slow they could go .
imo a physics degree is probably the most versitile undergraduate degree you can get .
it basically teaches you how to solve problems and the scope of the problems they can solve is much wider than a lot of people realize .
i missed playing 1 quiz yesterday and have to wait a year to get this badge .
my point is you ca n't expect norms in what is looking like might be one of the 15 coldest games in nfl history .
still i feel like having to work on channucha ramadan or christmastide would be met ... poorly by the workers .
that 's what i 'm saying or at least trying to .
but it also can target any other land you have .
i was saying why not fetch before combat so you can get two 3/3 's that 's all .
when it comes in have it target another land then fetch and have that land make itself or another land a 3/3 so you get 6 power with vigilance really quickly .
i 'm still somewhat new to fut as well and 41212-2 is definitely the best for starting out and especially for maintaining possession .

try turning them all off and enabling them one by one till the problem shows up .
i use gameplay alert on my phone tablet to alert me to when streams start .
but also you can watch their twitter they 'll normally announce it an hour ahead of time .
that being said i think ross said they were n't going to be streaming as much as they were before so they could focus more on making videos .
i hate how cosplayers keep feeling the need to photoshop their pictures to death you dont have to look like a perfect copy of the character let the costume speak for itself !
an impact drill applies a lot of torque to whatever is being drilled or screwed-in .
impact drills are generally used to sink heavy screws or lag bolts loosen or tighten nuts .
a hammer drill applies strikes '' to the drilling process it literally hammers as it drills .
hammer drills usually have three functions drill hammer and both .
hammer drills are generally used on concrete and metal .

very well let me make you an offer before we fight .
i pride myself on being apart from the colours i am a merciful being and as such i am going to offer you one .
you 've been a useful ally in the past and i see no reason you can not be once more after your ... rehabilitation ... in the ziggurat .
give me your word that you will dedicate your efforts to combating the colours once more and i will spare you .
furthermore i will reinstate you as the leader of this pack of cutthroats .

impact tools also make that impact on the actual rotation of the drill

for now i would just put the 'boyfriend ' in the back seat and focus on yourself .
remember that you do n't need someone to support you because you 're obviously are a strong and capable person .
then when you have a clearer grasp of the situation think about the boyfriend again .

i hope and think they will continue to use michael quite a bit .
he just adds an explosive element to the run game that we need .
we 're not even close to the time where we vote yet .
the fact that no candidate has specific numbers listed on their website would seem exactly in line with the way you think politics should be going ?
i guess in large part the complaint confuses me at this stage in the game .
you do n't put the jammer on the shield .
they are talking about having a jammer placed during the set up near a door .
when blitz comes within the radius his shield will be jammed .
you should n't be placing jammers after the round starts .
i watched episode iv yesterday as a part of a recap before i see vii and the lightsaber battle between vader and obi-wan is ridiculously bad .
i appreciate that back in 1980 ish they did n't have the equipment or the cgi to pull off the acrobatics of the prequels ' action scenes or make obi-wan as nimble as yoda was made to be in ep iii .
however it really undermines darth vader 's reputation as the most powerful being in the universe when his fights are so underwhelming and his dialogue is so un-intimidating .
in many respects the cinematography aged well but i think it was massively let down by a lack of foresight as to how big it could be so corners were cut .
no offense but he 's also pretty terrible in the playoffs in general .
i know brock does n't have any playoff experience but i think the offense is more suited to his skills rather than peyton .
shit we really need to do something about your tripping problem .
that 's the gs ball you ca n't get it in game it has apart of the celebii arc in the story out of game .

you have mage with 2x unstable portal and 1 sorcerors apprentice .

but apps use less data as compared to loading a full web page on the web browser you can have notifications and alerts which you ca n't while on a browser speaking of mobile ones widgets easily share content .
as for logging in almost all websites have you sign in these days to save preferences and stuff so it 's not just a thing with apps .
though i agree with your argument of apps requesting access to shit they do n't need but mostly it 's for finding people from your contacts that also use their or similar services and provide locally relevant content .
but yes some do access without any need thereof .
edit as for changing text size the only thing i can think of is using accessibility settings on your device and increasing the system font size although i 'm not sure if that would work sorry .
also increasing text size kind'a makes content hard to read because of small screen size of mobile devices what with all the scrolling now and then .
so if you look at it like this it 's sort of better that apps do n't let you change text size .
but that is something we 'll always have to deal with because of different screen sizes and applications
i thought it was brilliant how s9 was a throwback to rtd 's run with the tenth and murray gold fittingly brought back themes we have n't heard in the last few years of the eleventh .

i 've been a horror fan since the first time i saw the exorcist when i was around 8 .
i begged my parents to let me see it and my dad thought he 'd teach me a lesson about being afraid by letting me watch it in the dark den by myself .
scared the shit out of me gave me nightmares but it also hooked me on the genre .
it 's not real danger there 's cheesy humor in most horror flicks that i appreciate the special effects are amazing even at their worst and there 's usually more of a plot than in most rom-coms .
there are certain sub sets of the genre that i prefer more than others and i wo n't ever watch human centipede no matter how many sequels they make for example .
not saying you should force yourself to watch horror movies but if you 'd like to dip a toe in visit r/horror .

yeah exactly the fat kids in families which can afford food mean the ones in families which ca n't obviously have no problem at all .
and yet the 'fat kids ' are from the poorest backgrounds
the families which are spending too much on food obviously mean that the families that ca n't spend on food at all are just fine .
not ca n't wont..through lack of education on how to eat properly all the way down to blind selfishness and prioritising a pack of bensons and cider over putting food on the table ...
sure thing that 's why the use has exploded .
the fact it coincided with austerity policy benefit changes and benefit sanctions is just a coincidence .
it 's because of those pesky charities with agendas to push .
not soley but yes they have an agenda and people myself included love something for nothing ... once again look at the figures spending on food is down from 33 to 16 food is also now cheaper than its ever been .
think about who is telling us that there is food poverty ?
the fucking charities who need the idea to exist .

i was concerned for the internet for a few moments .
but i 'm referring to the everyday kinds of cases er docs and some homeless shelters see .
the patients show up barely functional and then pass out and start flailing .
the problem got so bad in the city that the city took over services like security in homeless shelters .
usually the trained officers appear to just remove hazardous objects near the patient and let it pass before taking them to the hospital .
they do restrain patients if they appear to be a significant threat to themselves or others but i do n't see them snapping people 's spines or anything .
in those cases i think a patient can reasonably be considered to not have autonomy for a short period of time .

there are games like elite dangerous and alien isolation which once you 've played in vr you just ca n't go back to the 2d version as it feels like the fun has been removed .
the best experiences on vr imo are driving games though .
i remember sitting on my race seat at my wheel and having my keyboard rested on my lap in live for speed and at the start of the race i went to place the keyboard on the games passenger seat and was taken back when i heard it thunk onto my wooden floor in my living room .
skyrim with vorpx also blew me away when i first tried it .
the game back then was generally unplayable due to not being able to read the menus correctly but just walking around and seeing the size and scale of the creatures and these huge mountains in the distance was a great experience .

the government 's office of personal management has been hacked and told me someone stole my fingerprint records .
i interned for a government agency a few years ago and they fingerprinted me .
now they 've been hacked so literal criminal hackers have a record of every single one of my fingerprints .
anyone with half a brain can now print my fingerprints with a 3d printer and leave evidence of my presence at whatever crime scene they 'd like .
how would i go about suing them for damages ?
edit hackers also gained access to my social security number address date and place of birth residency educational and employment history and other information from my background check .
in my troop everyone was treated equally and with the same quickness .
you should contact your local council head about the issue .
before that though i would tell the leaders how you feel to make them aware of the problem .

1st time dwi offender however i was not driving .
any help advice or shared experiences would be appreciated .
this is a repost from the self section as requested
long story short 2 weeks ago i went into a restaurant ordered 2 drinks decided i had too much once i got behind the wheel .
i turned the ignition/heater on as it was 41 degrees outside and i did n't have a coat and passed out .
roughly 5 hours later i am woken up by police officers in the restaurant parking lot with puke and piss all over me and was arrested for dwi .
i submitted to a blood test as i was not able to pass the sobriety test and was arrested .
i do not have the results ultimately i believe that something was slipped into my drink but that seems fairly irrelevant at this point .
a police officer friend told me to get the tape where the video shows me sleeping it off in the car and to fight it as the video will show i was being responsible not an offender .
2 drinks should have left my system by 5 or 6 hours that i needed to have the blood work tested for date rape '' and fight it that way .
i spoke to an attorney and he offered his services for roughly 5000 to watch my case for me until it actually gets docketed and then we '' will try to have the d.a .
throw it out on obstruction of a roadway misdemeanor instead as they may not have enough evidence to actually convict me .
thoughts or suggestions on how to proceed would be great .

does the vatican not say it is a mortal sin to skip mass and holy days ?
it does n't cost that much to ship a car from europe 1000-2000 is what i found on google .
certainly cheaper than buying a new car although it would take a few days .

spent most of my entire life in the midwest and 0f is fucking cold and just because it 's not the coldest it gets all year does not change that fact .
i live in phoenix now it is the equivalent of me saying that 110f is not that hot because we get 120f days .
but reality is 0f is that cold and 110f is that hot .
if she wrote her dates the other way i would expect that means she is in high school or something .
i clicked on next '' but it seems to be a post in a list of most viral '' images and has no indication to me of who uploaded it or what else they may have uploaded .
it definitely sets off all my scam senses but most things pasted in local do that .
am i the only one who thinks this is unacceptable ?
it seems pretty clear he has focused all his attention on the show at this point and the books take second priority .
not only does the man finish his own 1,200 page books which are outstanding btw but he was also able to finish another author 's series without massive delays .
i realize all authors wrote at a different pace but this is why we have deadlines .
i work in an office and all of my work is on a clock .
not only am i expected to finish a case within the clock but it is expected to be quality work .
it 's just a shame now that people who have been reading this series for almost a decade will now have to tiptoe around the internet for fear of spoilers once the show airs .
i 'm sure many people disagree but it seems to me that is a major showing of disrespect from the author .
i can pretty much guarantee that my 980ti will still be better than whatever the next console generation is .
your fucking 980 ti costs more than a console alone .
i have a 680 i got 3 years ago and it 's definitely not doing games as well as it used too .
feel free to list graphics cards that can run gta v released in 2009 .
still does n't take away from the fact that people want to play halo uncharted the last of us etc .
also guess what 99 of the list you posted are games that i 've either never heard of and/or are most likely not worth playing .
this is the argument of someone who does n't play on pc .
i have all 220 games i own installed on 2 4tb harddives .
from my couch in steam big picture mode i can access all of them and play them with the press of a button .
how is that not more accessible in every way to messing with disc boxes ?
also the games automatically update even when you are n't playing them .
that means no long updates every time you stick the disc in .
everthing you said there can be said about consoles also .
and oh if you did n't know you can own console games digitally too .
i just used put in the disc '' as an example of how easy it was .
okay i can back and off and agree that installing games on pc is almost as easy .
who the fuck says the best way gtav is on console because of pc hackers ?
literally the gta subreddits ... every time i see someone asking which platform to get the game on they say current gen .
you have no idea what you are talking about .
rockstar has total hack protection and will ban you for having even just some single player mods on your system if you go online .
hahhahhaha you have no clue what you're talking about .
you really think hackers have no way of avoiding anti hack systems .
i have friends who play gta pc and can testify for me .
the load times are better there are more people the graphics are better .
it is easily better pc and everyone knows it .
load times yes better well if you have a better hdd than on console which most people do .
more people ... well i 'm gon na guess there 's more on pc but not by a bunch .
ca n't get statistics about it but games like bf4 have quite a decent split in players over the newer consoles/pc .
that really depends on your pc running gta v at the lowest settings is pretty comparable to last gen graphics but of course if you 're able to max the graphics out it 'll be awy better than even current gen .
why would you want a console that only plays games
if you 're interested in playing games the rest does n't really matter not to mention 99.9 of people have some sort of shitty computer that they can do the rest of their stuff on .
that 's like asking someone why they would want a toast that only toasts bread ?
so they beat a slumping nv just before roster changes kinguin who were terrible at the time and they got two wins against fnatic and navi

not long after he began going on dating sites like okcupid and pof .
his main and only picture is one with him and my daughter a preschooler .
i do n't want strangers on the web to see my daughter 's face .
i texted him that i wanted it taken off .
he sees why but is making it hard for me .
i 'm guessing because we had an ugly break up .
my concern is that he keeps on making different accounts and using the same picture on there and on other places like tinder .
i really do n't want my kid 's face on places like that .
even if it 's removed once he can use her picture again and i do n't have the energy to go track him down .

what steps have you taken to appropriately introduce them ?
there is a plethora of introduction information available online from reputable sources to gradually work cats towards being able to tolerate each other .

keep in mind that if your mother 's cat just was n't socialized well when younger then there 's only so much that can be done .
you can also look into products that help to lower stress between cats such as feliway diffusers .

started when they were 6 and then happened every 2 years or so after .
at the 12-14 meeting they also brought in a rep from the police who gave overview of i.a .
sex crimes they observed towards teens tips on warning signs things we should tell the kids etc .
also when they were 12-14 they focused in the class room on porn consent coercion respecting boundaries when the time is right etc .
wish i 'd had that insight given to me .
i 'd have to think that discontinuing the the 007 would be a huge mistake for seiko since the 007/009 are so popular with watch enthusiasts .

playing on par '' does n't mean much though .

he makes mistakes that i do n't see other people make .
he also does n't have the decision making and game knowledge to know when to make more aggressive plays yet .
and i regularly play with the top '' people .
they are only 300-400 mmr higher than me typically but the skill difference is definitely there .

heavy exercise and extreme diet restrictions as purging after a binge .
it just keeps coming back once a week or sometimes twice a week .
you tell yourself just one but then you end up stuffing your face in the food .
the truth is that you have to give up the idea of weight loss and body shape first and forget all about dieting altogether .
i deleted myfitnesspal and stopped using kitchen scales and weight scales .
i stopped caring about my weight and i stopped weighing out food .
i read the book intuitive eating to reestablish my healthy relationship with food and body image .
i also purchased the book brain over binge to know that i am in control and i the human brain can let the animal brain yell at me to binge but human brain can ignore the urge no matter how strong it is and eventually the habits would go away .
my suggestions would be stop tracking stop weighing yourself and definitely read the two books i suggested because i have n't binged and i have n't gained any weight either from not tracking or weighing .

every propaganda item on the list can be argued to be true false and somewhere in between .
my point is that when we boil down issues to talking points like they hate our freedom '' or they want to hurt women '' or they want to rule the world '' we lose important information that should affect how we react to the situation .
and when those talking points strike at our emotions we throw all concern for whether they are true or not out the window .
btw the us ended up supporting the khmer rouge after leaving vietnam and instigated ethnic conflict in laos funded by money gained from the growing and transportation of heroin in the country which lead to the retaliatory ethnic cleansing of the hmong people in laos .
i think botaka is a perfect fit for the bench currently .
he offers pace a direct attacking outlet that byram does n't possess .
sam 's great at drifting inside linking up with the midfield/attack but botaka could be so useful against a tired opposition .
it 's a shame that evans does n't seem to want to use him at all .
putland is a pretty good replacement for richo when he plays in odi
there 's movie similar to that i think it 's called four rooms '' .
this is n't really a problem but when your pilot .
do a a let you set a spending cap ?
one reason why i would n't like a contract sim in this situation is because you may not notice it 's failed over and racking up the gbs is n't cheap even at 2.4p/mb .
i would n't want to use anyone other than ee/3 because i do n't like gprs .
i wish there were more mobile broadband sims where i could buy a block of data and leave it there for as long as i want i 'd rather see a you 've run out of data '' page than a huge bill .
vodafone used to do it this way but they 've since changed .
3-2-1 is close but of course you ca n't use it in something other than a phone
dxm is child 's play anyway in my opinion .
if you 're low dousing sure but the upper plateus really are something noteworthy it just takes a while to get there .
you for damn sure do n't take anything with something other than dxm in it and subjecting yourself to guaifenesin is amateur hour to begin with .
rite aid used to make gels that were just 10mg of straight dxm but parents caught on and most of the abusables are not as readily available as they used to be .
do n't think about the fact that your car is powered by literally thousands of explosions happening just a few feet in front of you .
but blowing up the planet would cause him harm .
also the english language has evolved since shakespeare 's days .
if you look at transliterations of it the spirit clearly says that no man born from a woman can harm macbeth .
oooh ok. what made her strike you as confident ?
i 'm trying to find out what works and does n't work for character development .
although i 've seen the aforementioned 'four rooms ' this was the one i came to mention .
miller and dante are awesome in their own right but i always found it interesting that spielberg and landis could do the two worst segments of a movie .
both were boring and trite versus the trippy/creepy of dante 's and the awesome/creepy segment by miller .
by sithis reading this really put me in the mood to play .
for anyone on this subreddit who hasn't seen the kendra sunderland library video yet
or maybe if you used rejack you would be invunerable for two or three seconds but you are n't allowed to use grenades or guns for thoose two or three seconds .
the majority of reddit use res anyway so gifv is preffered
or sonic http imgur.com/jzne7tp this link might be spoiler to some people
i think that is why people want her to be able to break her own webs so they can gain movement speed while slowing anyone who walks on the web .
that would give some sort of escape as well as still acting as an initiation .

the only way it could be worse is if it was a rat 's anus .
i recall about a month ago i googled him specifically because i suspected this has already happened .
so i do n't know why i 'm surprised .
the prosecutors delayed the trial until defense could argue that he was being held without trial '' and asked for his release prior to trial and it appears it worked .
i guess we can all feel a bit better knowing that there are many other killer cops that lurk our streets every day he 's just one more shark in a big ocean .
my one for r/ireland would be that the only drug i 'd like to see decriminalised and then legalised is weed .
the rest i 'd like to see remain illegal .
however for ireland as a whole this would n't be an unpopular opinion .
for me it turns me on much more to see her enjoying it .
i 'm fascinated by the female orgasm and the loss of control that accompanies it .
it 's a wonderful experience especially if you have roots there .
for anyone who 's interested especially those in the us the dollar is strong right now so you 'll get an excellent exchange rate .
japan makes it very easy for people to travel and are generally welcoming towards tourists .
here are some simple tips to travel in japan on the cheap
for flights check for off-peak rates usually in the summer and winter .
i do n't recommend traveling in july as it 's the rainy season and humid as hell .
i 've traveled to japan in the dead of winter on purpose and it was lovely with the snow in the mountains and all that .
if you do n't mind the cold go in early winter .
say these prayers five our father five ave maria and five salve regina '
of all the crappy things the catholic church stand for like original sin which alleges that all newborn babies are damned from the start this practice of setting an arbitrary number of repetitions of a prayer as an empirical judgement that it will make god happy is the most off-putting imo .
of course all prayer routines set after a clock and in preset order like islamic daily prayer and buddhist prayer cylinders feel equally fake and posing .
but to go okay say 3 ave marias and 2 our father if you accidentally swore and if you were caught without your habit on your head you will of course throw one salve regina in there as well '' it just sounds so corrupt and totally fake .
if there ever was an immortal creator being he does n't do goddamn arithmetic and keep tabs like frigging santa claus .

i suppose it 's akin to the cat schrodinger refuses to admit is freudian ?
as i cradle faith i whole-heartedly respect the boundaries of everyone in their discovery of just what the hell we 're doing on this spinning rock .
i know you said you 're not looking for an answer but what is life if not discovery ?
i try to keep my god thing personal because as we all know it 's not a conversation piece until it 's a debate to most sadly .
that said while i may 'have faith ' there is the science side of it with the logical view based on centuries of madness .
the logical view not the madness of what 'religion ' 'justified ' in the past
truly as it is said to each their own .
if we could all learn to stop killing each other over it we just might evolve past our baser flaws and learn to breathe .
offending deceptive people does n't sound like a problem to me .
asking an honest person for proof is likely to offend them and it suggests you are used to being around untrustworthy people .
i would just ask for a skype call because i find txt inadequate and frustrating '' which is the truth .
also i would be nervous about getting into a relationship with someone who is n't comfortable with real-time calls and who might withdraw behind a txt wall if things are difficult .
i checked my personal collection and i do have 3 stormtroopers with pure black heads .
torsos are different from the death star ones though .
i can take close up pictures of all the stormtroopers i have if that helps .

i bet every day everyone in the town walks out onto their porch at first light with a several-generations old mug filled with some steaming hot chocolate a breakfast pastry made with grandma 's scratch recipe and smug look on their faces thinking just how perfectly picturesque their little town is .
the above comment gave the flare thing which is similar for the druid .

chomsky is incredibly hostile to marxism dismissive of dialectics and snarky in a stemacist way about social science in general .

so on the dominos app after you make an order it gives you a screen that shows you the 10 rewards points you acquired for making the order and underneath it has a section for bonus points . ''
what are those bonus points and how do you acquire them ?
i have n't played dota 2 in a really long time .
how do i get back into it and where do i find out what i should be doing now as far as starting items and meta .
you know i always hear this idea that feminists think drunk sex is rape from third party sources like mras but rarely do i ever see one actually claiming all drunk sex is rape .
i think people like to force this idea that feminists think this way as a method to try and discredit them as nuts .
though there is still a vocal minority that believes this .
i think the reason one would reach this conclusion is because alcohol is the number one date rape drug and it 's just easier to say all drunk sex '' is wrong then have people try to get as close to the line of having sex with a really really drunk person without it being technically rape .
and rapists actually prefer using alcohol over force to blur the lines of consent to make it easier to get away with .
you hear about those frats trying to get freshman girls who do n't know their limits as drunk as possible and that 's disgusting .
i think the backlash from that kind of culture has swung some people in the direction of no drunk sex period .
how i feel about it is if you have actual morals that do n't rely entirely on the law and would rather go home thirsty than rape someone you 're fine .
i think most people who are n't psychopaths have that instinct .
i saw the question in the sidebar but there 's so much new information that has come out in the past 3 years about this kind of stuff that i think it 's possible people think differently now in 2016 than they did even in 2013 .
also what would a pure version of the deck look like ?
one of my older pet chickens died yeah i caused it .
i originally was gon na post the backstory but whatever last month .

i saw a video recently of sasha grey sucking a cameraman 's dick in some sort of behind the scenes style porn marathon .
around her were a bunch of porn shoots going on at the same time and the title mentioned a porn marathon .
just wondering if anyone has any idea where the rest of the scene is or if it 's possible to get another scene from the same shoot .
i laveyan was talking with my girlfriend antitheist about what we believe as a religion and i started thinking about something where has satanism grown as a religion ?
where are our forefathers of thought truly questioning what it is to truly be a satanist ?
and yes satanism is different for each satanist but why are n't we discussing our views and growing in our faith ?
can i use a star citizen gift card that i buy on my own account like to add 10 dollars
i am not able to connect to any of the following
console indicates attempted connection to web socket 0.0.0.0:0 which is invalid .
i think that whatever maps are running they are too full and no more players can join .
recently it seems like players are being crammed onto fewer maps for a particular region/mode .
for example oceania teams mode used to have 3-5 maps running now there are only 1 or 2 despite an increase of players due to christmas/summer break .
if a reduction in the number of available servers is occurring for other regions then it is a major reason behind the increased lag of late .
can anybody else connect to one of the above servers region/mode ?
i do n't remember this being announced in any weekly update .
maybe it was snuck into the cyberdogs update or something .
hi everyone ... looking for a little help on dynamic cascading selects .

so far i 've managed to interrupt jax 's jump+stun so that he got knocked back and missed his e also managed to interrupt rammus powerball so he got knocked back and could n't get in range of taunt .

so for the past 2 years i 've know this girl .
she considers me her best friend i think she was asking who i liked and she may have used it to try to get it out of me but i consider her one of my best friends .
we are long distance but i do have her phone number but we do n't text much i 've always start the conversations .
however she always starts the conversations in real life i am shy .
im assuming she likes me because she asks for hugs we met at a church and she gave me a hug and everyone assumed that i liked her so she stopped doing it there and only in place where there were n't a ton of people she knew i figured this out on my own .
it seems as though her friends and her sisters are hinting at it since they are very kind to me and some of them talk to me more than she does to me .
i 'm just going to add this in it probably wo n't help but i 'll do it just in case i texted her happy new year !
should have put we '' and she texted me ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è '' this may seem stupid but i 'll add it in just in case .
this might not help either but she likes to take a lot of selfies of me with her mostly with her and she only posted it once we too a selfie and she posted it on my story on snapchat not hers and most of the time she takes selfies on her phone i 've only taken one so i assume she will let me take selfies with her .
the first time we met it was on a bus on the way to a summer camp and her friend had thrown up in her seat so since her friend could n't since there she could have just sit straight up she asked out of everyone around her me to sit there .
i assumed a year later this was her attempt to get to know me or sit next to me or both .
i ended up doing that and i think we talked for a while .
supposedly she said that we got very close in only 3-4 days and after that event was over that 's when the hugging started to begin next event note that i barely knew her and she already began giving me hugs i have never seen her hug anyone else .
plus it seems as though she talks to me most of the time and i rarely see her talk to other boys and she especially never gives hugs to them .
she also tried very hard for me to tell her who i liked and she named off all of the girls i talked to of course her best friends that she hanged out while was around and one of her sisters that i talked to the most .
she even told one of her sisters to help her figure it out it was the sister i talked to the most and i told that sister but luckily she did n't tell her sister i think .
she is also always smiling and talking positive around me i think she 's always like that since she seems to always be like that but i do n't know .
but judging from what i know i think we both know we like each other but we do n't want to admit it maybe not yet .
do we both know that we like each other ?
seller refunded 1.50 from item but this only showed up on ebay 's mobile app as purchase refunded '' not partially refunded and did n't show the tracking anymore .
i message the seller asking in more words what ''
in a panic because shit i really wanted it i bought the same item for less in another store .
upon finding out it was a partial refund and still was n't shipped the preshipment info is sent but that 's all i asked for a refund .
ebay closed the return seller is n't going to refund .
i 'm looking to build a more competitive edh deck as my first one since i am not the biggest fan of playing purely for fun which i know is kinda terrible anyways the 2 generals that have been calling to me are either sen triplets or angus mackenzie if anyone plays a competitive or at least super refined list do you mind sharing a link so i can see what i can get into ?
if these are n't the generals i should be looking towards can someone point me in a similar direction to either of them ?

does anyone have a still of this shot so we can translate what it says ?
i have not been impressed with how kessel has played with us as of late .
he is a very fast skater and shows his nice shot once in awhile but i feel like he misses a lot of opportunities .
from what i see he often misses a lot a feeds from malkin and other rebound chances that look like they could be a sure goal .
bottom line i just do n't think were getting the value out of him that we wanted when looking for a top 6 winger over summer .

i just bought a 1970s smith-corona super g portable typewriter .
it works great and it looks awesome but having never typed on a typewriter before i 'm finding it difficult .
any keys using my pinky and ring finger like qwasxz and opklm are hardly even visible on the paper when typed and all the rest of the keys all seem pretty light as well .
i put a new ink ribbon in so it 's not that .
i know that is manual so it takes more force but the only way that i can get it to type well is to peck at it with one or two fingers which kinda hurts after a while and is slower and makes more typos .
is there anything i can do to improve this ?
also a lot of the time when trying to type hard to make the type more visible my fingers slide in between the keys .
i assume just more practice will fix that but over all what tips for better typing can you guys give me ?
yeah no hype hahaha just glad i picked him up sunday for my yahoo fantasy after trading rinne for oel .

i want to have an ordinary life and i really do n't want to stand out .
however it 's really difficult for me to quit cding .
i 'd throw out all the clothes only to buy them again in future .
it 's beginning to worry me because now that i 'm approaching my 30s i have to start a family and i want to be happy in my marriage .
just like 90 of the new posts at the moment it is about the new update and scs vision of the game .
i was a pretty dedicated farmer since i reached th9 and really loved war as well .
when i reached th10 i slowly lost interest in wars because of the 3 star difficulty .
so farming is what kept me in the game .
i 'm the typical barcher in silver/gold who just looks for dead bases and i liked it because that is something you can do on the side or hardcore with boosts .
the 2 things that keep this enjoyable are 1. the high play time because of reasonable training times .
you want to be able to play for 30 min or play for 6 hours and 2. the feel of progression for the time you put in so you get the desire to play more .
right now you can put in the time with barch but get no reward for it so why bother .
my main concern with the way sc think this game is supposed to be played has to do with the potential playtime .
in the perfect game of clash they want everybody attacking and getting attacked by big armys and a lot of effort to get the loot .
i would n't mind doing loon attacks and wigibarch for reasonable amount of loot but the training times are a huge problem .
in the newest forum post sc says they want to improve resource saving '' and this sounds like they want you to lose less resources to progress easier .
the resource saving easy progression point is for me not a reason to come back to this game .
i dont care if i get like 1 mil per attack but can only attack every 1-2 hours .
this wont keep me interested for a long time .
you are forced to boost and even then it is still too slow imo if you want to train any other army comp than barch .
i think dark troops like the witch and golem should have long brew times to make them feel more unique and special when you make them and prepping for war should take some time but for farming troops this is ridiculous .
loons wizards and maybe valks should have the training time significantly not loot bonus significantly '' but like 50 decreased to make it possible to play this game like they want you to .
you should not always be forced to boost and it should also not feel slow as fuck even when you boost .
i do n't think the game was perfect and i think most of scs ideas about the game are good .
i think sniping was dumb and i would like to have more interesting divers farming comps and attacks but if that 's at the cost of basically playing the game than something is wrong .
one last message to sc if they happen to read it balance the game so war is fun again .
tl dr sc kills barch but training times for wizards and loons too long to enjoy the game .
requested my rma for my rival where the rubber was coming off .
receive an email back an hour later with my rma number .
sent my mouse back today and then updated the ticket with the tracking number .
2 hours later i received a promo code for 70 10 more than the rival
so i just ordered a replacement rival and also a qck for free .
after playing badwater_tilt and pl_angkor for the first time i 'm really desperate to find links to maps that go the extra mile into the zone of creativity .
lately tf2 just has n't been as fun for me especially considering i have like 5k hours in the game so the thought of new content that i have n't seen before or played a million times is really exciting .
also before you tell me to just go to tf2maps.net keep in mind just how long it takes to sift through that site for specific maps and that getting a download link can be hard even when you find a good map .
so like the rest of you i go for a remicade infusion every 8 weeks .
my premed is 50mg of benadryl and 50mb of prednisone an hour before my infusion .
however as i found out sometime since my second last infusion and the one today my body stopped the ability to metabolize the pill format of benadryl leading to shortness of breath flushing and a tight chest that left me without breath .
i 'm so lucky i was able to speak up quickly enough because they were able to get the pure form of benadryl into my iv line before things got worse .
what is supposed to be a 2.5 hour process turned into 5 hours .
i 've never been more concerned in my life .
tomorrow i set up another appointment with my gi doctor to see about getting the iv form of benadryl with my infusion as pills dont work .
there is a possibility that my current box has expired thus making the pill not work as its supposed to but we 'll see .
all i can remember is the movie is kid friendly and was maybe in a snowy type of area at first .
what i remeber is their was a train and it can walk around without being on a track and i think he had some friends with him to go and find something ?

i am building my next character as my last one got turned to stone and no one really cared enough to turn her back and i was thinking bard .
more specifically a valor bard half-orc great weapon fighting .
a skald with a huge flute and a huge sword .
what i can not decide between is whether to start with a level of fighter and then later take heavy armor master or great weapon fighting as a feat or just stick with valor bard all the way through possibly taking heavily armored .
other tips on a melee two-handed bard build will also be appreciated .
i am in high school and i am currently attending sort of a trade school through my school for automotive technology .
i can do oil changes mount and balance tires do brakes change fuel and air and oil filters pull codes diagnose simple problems replace serpentine belts and more .
i 've applied at quick lube places and they seem to ignore me along with other shops .
the biggest thing is i am only open weekends as i am doing high school swim .
if i was n't doing swim i could have a job right now .
the main thing is that i want to work around cars my parents want me to get any job that 's available even if that means me working at mcdonald 's no offense if anyone works there .
hi guys i 'm fairly new to warhammer 40k and i 've encountered some difficult rules questions .
i 'm wondering how a khorne lord of skulls thunderblitzing/ramming an imperial knight would be resolved .
there seems to be a lot of conflicting rules about how this would be done and i just ca n't get my head around it .
any rules fanatics care to have a go at explaining it to me ?

so the story goes she found another guy online they talk a ton she says shes falling out of love with me .
then today she talks to a mutual friend and she says the real reason she left is she loved '' him .
after this she proceeds to show the friend a picture of his privates and continues to brag how its larger than mine a total lie not that it matters .
so she has already been messaging this guy pics .
here 's the reason i get mad and want to tell her shes being dumb .
i want to preface this by saying i do n't want her back so thats not a motivator .
he is a 15 year old who lives 200 miles away .
he is an alcoholic and has been arrested for child pornography .
he was showing pictures of other girls to random people online .
plus he even shared a video of him doing intimate things with a girl .
and she wants to be with him for some reason .
so i know the right thing to do is leave her alone and go no contact and let her ruin her own life and that 's where i am at but part of me wants to tell her or her parents that this is happening .
it would be stupid but part of me wants to .
tl dr girlfriend is dating a 15 year old who is an asshole of a person .
how do i stop wanting to tell her or her parents what happening .
i recently got interested in playing dnd after talking to many friends and seeing many sessions when i visit a local gaming store in my mall .
i was astounded at the complexity and character emphasis of it all and immediate fell in love .
so i wanted to dm a campaign with some close friends ... much to my dismay it was n't a great experience it was riddled with arguments annoying situations that i had to deal with on my part and a slow campaign that still has n't gotten anywhere .
so as i have grown more interested in the game as time went by and no party to play with i decided to come here for a request .
i want to find a specific party that would be willing to put up with a new dm who 's trying to learn and assist me to better understand the rules and help me formulate fair and helpful house rules or have me as a player in a campaign with a harder focus on teaching me the game .
i have the use of tabletop simulator what the first half of my first campaign was on and roll 20 i also have the pathfinder core rule book and frequently use 20pfsrd to help me with my campaigns .
i usually play with a more on-the-fly '' style with not to much meticulous planning but i do acknowledge that planning is needed and usually keep specific details secrets loot and branching paths plotted down .

my account is brand new but i would allow the person i am trading with to verify the code works before they need to give me theirs .
i remember it was going along smoothly for a while then there were no updates .
comment below with info or message adeurm or crush-proof619 .
there 's lots of hardcore draft nuts around these parts and as things heat up i 'm curious to hear some new perspectives .
scouting is an inexact science with sooo many variables but it 's oh so fun .
obviously the name of the game is figuring out how a player will translate to the nba and how they then continue to grow .
if a player has a great nose for where he is on the court in relation to other players the game combined with smooth body control fluid in their movements then we have a prospect we can work with .
sometimes you can get away with with an uncoordinated big man if they 're an elite athlete who 's young like 19 years old max .
james harden always had amazing body control and spatial awareness even in college .
you can identify these traits by their use of body balance footwork changes of direction efficiency of their movements awareness of their physical tools and how they use them .
but i look at it this way mass x mobility .
the more mass a player has the easier they can carve out space .
but more mass requires more twitch energy to move around .
a player might be really athletic but super skinny will barton or a player might be massive but does n't get to their spots as fast as others .
twitch athleticism synergistically combined with mass is where it 's at .
terrence jones was never a freak athlete but he could move a good amount of mass around .
it synergistically works well obviously not this season though lol .
people said draymond was n't athletic but he actually had good physical synergy going on .
if you have the two combos listed above mixed with a translatable nba skill or two say shooting or defending pick and rolls then you have a great slate to mold a player .
the spatial awareness x fluidity mobility x mass combo means all they can become something great once they train their nba skills .
maybe they 'll be a defender maybe they 'll improve their ball handling and be a slasher etc .
i look at someone like ben simmons and he might not have lebron james esque physical gifts but he passes this test with flying colours .
sure he ca n't shoot yet but the dude has a lot to work with .
for me this is the other half of assessing a player 's likeliness to succeed in the nba .
i 'm big on psychology and i 'm a big believer in that your subconscious mind creates your reality .
it 's hard to assess this stuff from the sidelines here and teams have private tests in place to get a feel for this stuff background tests psychological tests but i watch interviews and keep my ear to the ground for reports and look hard to get a sense for how they 're wired .
are more about team camadaderie or are they more self serving ?
are the positive intillgent competitive mentally strong etc etc ?
there 's no cut and dry way to assess this stuff but imo it plays a huge role in their career results .
if a player is reported to have amazing work habits work ethic then i make a mental note to put a big green tick next to his name .
these are the guys who come out of nowhere 3-4 years down the line .
so that 's basically how i assess a player 's upside .
if they tick those boxes then i start gushing .
and you know who ticked those boxes for me last year ?
dude is gon na be an impact player one day imo .
but there is a whole other part of scouting .
and that is figuring out which skills or traits they have can be translated over to nba .
there 's many traits to look at tactical awareness decision making creativity composure anticipation risk/reward recognition instincts motor/exertion etc .
i 'd like to hear everybody else 's perspective the actual tangible skills side of things i.e .
what do you look for in the way of nba skills ?
tldr i listed some facets i look for in prospects sorry for the length got carried away .
if my math and memory is correct i get about 9 medium to large sized bowls in my spoon pipe out of a gram .
this will only cover seasons 1 and 2 of the durarara ! !
someone asked me that and i beat him within an inch of his life .
in a universe filled with supernatural beings like dullahans immortals from baccano !
and demon swords shizuo according to word of god stands as one of the strongest characters if not the strongest character .
despite being only a human shizuo possesses near superhuman physical skills .
his power is likened to adrenaline '' power people possess in times of emergencies .
shizuo 's great strength is explained this way normally the brain restricts one 's power shutting down muscles in response to pain in order to prevent serious injury shizuo does n't have this limitation and is capable of using his full strength .
shizuo is quiet and reserved but has an extremely short temper .
for a majority of his life he hated his strength and he hated violence but he eventually was able to accept himself the way he was .
he is known for wearing a bartender 's uniform despite him working as a bodyguard for a debt collector .
throws a vending machine several stories into the air .
he also hits people hard enough to send them through solid concrete .
as a child his body was unable to withstand his own strength so he 'd injure all the time .
as time progressed his body became strong enough to contain his power .
more than a hundred pile up on him and he picks them up and punches through them .
his punches and kicks are strong enough to send people flying away without him even touch them .
recently injured shizuo uses a highway sign to slice off the top of a car .
https gfycat.com/reflectinggreatchameleon he then uses it as a javelin and chucks it several yards away .
gets run over by a truck and then proceeds to pick it up and throw it .
kicks a car down the street like it 's a soccer ball .
uses a traffic sign to break and chuck a van sized piece of the road .
speed reacts fast enough to catch a throwing knife between his teeth .
gets hit in the back of the head by a bat .
he bleeds but he just smiles and gets angry .
he proceeds to get right back up to chase izaya .
https gfycat.com/mediumperfectbuffalo but he does n't even register the pain .
he gets shot three times and is able to nonchalantly walk to the doctor 's to get treated .
https gfycat.com/watchfulnegligiblehoneycreeper he did n't even realize that he was shot .
brushes away a stun gun that had enough voltage to kill a normal human .
three knives fall and embed themselves in shizuo 's back .
aim dodges machine gun fire from varona one of russia 's best assassins .
scales a building and then runs fast enough to keep up with an 18 wheeler .
please do n't argue about real life peak humans compared to fictional ones .
the black bike is celty the dullahan and the bespectacled girl is the host of the original demon blade .
varona has already fought both of them yet she fears shizuo the most .
you can find more of his feats in his respect thread .
we currently have the 24th ranked class in the country according to 247 .
plus there have been a lot of decommits recently .
although butch did bring in a couple of great classes there were some key legacy players that helped to recruit other good players to ut .
should we be worried that recruiting may drop off and we 'll be getting classes ranked 20 ?
it 's obvious that butch has upgraded the talent level .
but a bad class can really set back a program .
... facial hair i think it grew because he suddenly felt older and he shapeshifted it .
sorry if this is a dumb question but is it possible to split screen two programs and have one keyboard operate one window and the other keyboard operate the other at the same time ?
for gaming purposes i want to be able to play a mmo on two accounts at the same time without needing two computers .
currently i can log onto both and splitscreen it but i have to switch windows each time i want to switch my character .

upon closer examination it 's pretty discolored and probably needing a filling .
any idea how much this is going to cost me ?
also any recommendations on which dentist i should check out ?

i recently came across the vapecig big ger model relatively cheaply so i decided to pick one up .
it is my first mod/ecig type of gadget and i had a question regarding the batteries .
the paper that came in the box said to use 3.7v 3000mah ones .
due to where i live and everything ecig related being banned the only ones i could find were 3.7v 5000mah ones .
someone told me i should n't use them especially with a dna200 device due to a low amp limit 10 when i should be looking for at least 20 .
can i use the 5000mah ones to hold me off until i can get my hands on better ones ?
or should i not use them in the device at all ? Ôªø

i 've experienced sleep paralysis many times and this is not it .
over the last few months i 'll wake up from sleeping and look out i 'll see creatures or designs made of light .
they are usually fleeting and dissapear after a few seconds i 'm not paralyized when this happens and i can move .
i usually write it off as my eyes adjusting and/or my mind playing tricks on me .
i just had it happen again tonight but it wasnt fleeting and was nothing like i 've ever experienced .
i woke up suddenly about an hour after going to bed hovering over me was a shimmering web of light and another light creature beside it .
i jumped out of bed and ran to the light switch when i looked back it was still there .
i stared at it for a few seconds hoping my eyes would adjust and it would go away but it still stayed .
finally i switched on the light and it disappeared .
i was pretty shaken by this and stayed up for about an hour before going to bed .

the demonic king chases his wife the rebellious good-for-nothing miss
she a renowned assassin of the 21st century actually crossed over to become su manor 's most useless good-for-nothing fourth miss .
he the empire 's imperial highness prince jin was an emotionless overbearing demonic tyrant with unrivaled talent .
everyone knew that she was an idiotic good-for-nothing and bullied her as they pleased .
but only he the overbearing tyrant with the discerning eye just would n't let go even if his life depended on it .
for the time being let 's see how the clash of stubborn versus stubborn plays out in this good show of the chaser and the chased .
i keep glancing over and over at the faded green clock in my car dash .
11:45pm on a tuesday night in december and here i am back in the same parking lot in the same neighborhood i swore to myself i would n't come back to this soon .
i was just here yesterday and then two days before that and a day before that and ...
it 's been almost 24 hours since i 've felt that warm blanket of complacency wrap around my mind as if to say you need this to feel like yourself again. is life so jagged that you had to come back here to this place again in the hopes of grinding some of the edges off your monotonous existence ?
you say that you do n't need them these little blue thirty dollar tickets to a better understanding of who you are as a person to help unlock your ‚Äòpotential . '
you say that this will be the last time for a week that you have other things to spend your money on you have bills to pay and quite frankly it 's becoming harder and harder to stay wrapped in that blanket .
each time you come here it takes just a little more to feel the way you want to feel one more toe that ca n't quite get warm under the covers .
every passing minute feels like a missed opportunity to leave and break the cycle .
how did we get here ? the narrator to my life would be saying if this was a movie and the audience was looking for deeper contextual awareness .
freezing my ass off in a borrowed car from a friend who thinks i moonlight as a bartender to keep up with student loan payments the audience would learn about my first experience with my blanket when all it took was a few vicodin to keep my mind from racing and the pain in my ... no the narrator would stop .
our lead character is using that as a crutch to mask his addiction there is n't anything physically wrong with him .
or at least there was n't until he started parking his borrowed car in this fucking parking lot every other day .
he never takes this long something must have happened .
did i give him enough motivation to pick up for me ?
is he holding this over my head laughing from the apartments i can see through my fogged up windshield waiting for me to text again and again questioning how long until he gets here ?
he always comes through says the narrator to the audience ... and that 's where the problem began in the first place. yeah he comes through like a conquering viking pillaging the soft belly of my soul with blue poison-tipped daggers .
i need the pain to subside and i need my blanket .
i can almost imagine how my life is going to change in the next 20 minutes .
he 's going to jump in this car i 'll get everything i need and then i 'm done with this parking lot .
on wet pavement white lines and cars start to blur together and remind me of how close i am to my goals and dreams .
it 's like the painted boundaries of this parking lot are some sort of metaphor for my boxed in potential clouded by the haze of desire that continues to fog up this borrowed car in this parking lot that i wo n't be coming back to anytime soon .
all he needs to do is open the car door and i 'll be on my way .
driving with one hand on the steering wheel the other crushing and chopping crushing and chopping until i can finally rail myself back into my blanket .
sitting on his couch he closes his eyes with a half smile that only he knows the reason behind .
his girlfriend talks about the new shoes she 's thinking of picking up tomorrow the narrator says softly not wanting to wake me .
in my dreams the sky is blue but all i see are the white lines of a parking lot .
i mainly need help with my main deck ratios and what all i should add into my extra deck .
this is currently what i have been running the past two days .

this is my basic list i 've gathered from youtube and testing any help is much appreciated .
2x jett synchron because i ca n't afford ghost ogre
i have two back to back 100ks a week apart to be specific in may 2016 .
both are elevation based roughly 13,000 feet per race but starts and ends at roughly sea level .
i finished my first ultra last may and was completely dead by the next day .
my training consisted of putting in as many miles as possible up to 75 mpw and literally no core .
i 've taken about 4 months off running now .
i 've been at the gym for the past 3 months and unfortunately but also fortunately added a hefty 25 pounds bringing my frame to about 150 pounds .
it 's been mostly compound exercises deadlifts bench press dips squats and very few isolated exercises .
i initially wanted to bulk up which i am done at this point .
my reps have gone up and the weights have gone down .
it 's more about lifting for an enduring amount of time at this point .
run purely for elevation during the week days and a super duper long run during the weekend ?
please do n't talk about nutrition because i love to eat .
i 'm known as the garage man at the dinner table .
but if there are non-nutrition related tips you could send my way please do .
ps i think the reason why my knees were completely shot was the sloppy form that resulted in the last 14 miles .
bad biomechanics puts greater strain on tendons and muscles which could have been a contributing factor to all that post-race pain .
looking through a bunch of top posts on this subreddit has got me feeling pretty frustrated ... y'all look so good and i want to get to a point where i feel good about myself too .
i 'm out to a couple of my close friends as genderqueer/transmasc but i have no idea how to start on hormones .
i 'm completely financially dependent on my dad who has been very supportive my whole life about queer stuff he guessed i was a lesbian before i ever came out to him as such and was pretty unphased .
he generally is supportive of the idea of trans people and trans rights but as far as i know he has never met a trans person and i 'm not sure how he 'd take it if i told him when he found out ablut my tattoo he didnt talk to me for 24 hours .
he pays for my current psychiatrist and i want to talk to him about switching to a new one who specializes in gender stuff but i have no idea how and i 'm so scared .
a lot of people have been up in arms about the latest update but as most of us are aware this in not the first time this has happened .
i feel that this is due to a general overarching problem with balance in this game the devs do n't do things in moderation .
well cast your minds back to the behemoth gate nerf .
they were n't nerfed slightly they were nerfed to high heaven .
were they weakened by 25 or even 50 to test the effect on the game ?
no they were reduced by 75 and are now so fragile that many are afraid to take their dinos out of their base .
or the attempt to nerf battle pteras which for a time made pteras completely worthless because their every perk was taken from them .
it was intended to be the apex predator of the island .
so was it made 2x as strong as the previous apex the rex ?
no it was made many times stronger than that .
so what do i think needs to be done ?
it would be nice if whenever a stat change was needed i minor one was done first to test the waters as it were before anyone even considers implementing a massive alteration like 75 i do n't know if the devs panic a bit when they get flak for a creature being powerful but the nerf that inevitably follows tends to seem reactionary and overkill .
ok that about sums up what i wanted to say .
and just in case anyone in under the illusion that i hate this game i would n't write a reddit essay on a game i did n't enjoy immensely .
hello everyone i live in sweden having recently moved here from the uk in mar 2015 .
i am currently setting up a csa farm but at the moment i am lacking in any sort of machinery .
i have been extremely lucky and landed myself 5acres of land to rent which has been very roughly plowed .
i have my eye on a cultivator that i might be able to afford at the end of this month but i am struggling to find attachments for it .
do i need to buy various different walking tractors ?
i had stupidly assumed you just purchased add on 's for them .
i 'm new here and reddit seems like a great place to ask for advice .
during these two years he has been an amazing boyfriend .
he always makes sure i am happy treated well respected .
he is very well respected man hardworking determined and responsible .
after a few months into our relationship he revealed to me that he has been doing drugs weed recreationally with friends mdma shrooms cocaine hard drugs only once possibly more if he has n't mentioned it to me yet .
he had a difficult time telling me this because he was afraid i may think of him differently .
i did n't get mad at him instead i was glad he was honest .
i asked him questions out of curiosity about the drugs so that i could understand him better .
i honestly do n't mind him doing pot with his friends .
he chooses to not smoke in front of me .
but as time went on he started talking more about our future .
once he randomly mentioned that if we were to get married one day he would stop taking drugs .
in another day he mentions that if we were to live together he would like to continue smoking weed in the house when i 'm around .
he would also mention that if we had kids he would never smoke in front of them and only smoke somewhere else .
the more he talked about it the more i felt uncomfortable .
if my family found out my boyfriend was taking drugs my throat would be sliced .
at the moment they love my boyfriend and think he is the perfect match for me .
or at least that is what i think right now .
his usage of drugs does n't seem to affect him negatively in any way .
i see it more in a way to bond with his friends .
he graduated from a great school has a great job and his responsible enough to handle himself financially and emotionally at this very moment .
people have warned me to be careful in the future .
and to not be in a relationship with a man who does drugs .
to be honest i feel a bit uncomfortable with the thought that he uses weed and i would prefer not to do it with him .
i 'm wondering if this is a sign to re-think my relationship .
should i continue this relationship and see where it goes or leave ?
should i confront him about the fact i feel uncomfortable ?
i would also love to hear from those who are in a similar relationship .
boyfriend talks about our future and would like to continue taking drugs
i 'm trying to find a story where a boy joins a new school part-way through the year but is not allowed onto the already full football team .

edit whm but recently i 've been trying to tackle cutter 's cry in the duty finder .
yea i know ... that 's always a bad place to start .
but i just ca n't seem to get this second boss fight and i have been getting a lot of slack for it .
let me explain first party i told them right at the beginning i was new .
nobody said anything about it did n't bother explaining any mechanics to me .
and then the blm gets super mad because we had a wipe on the second boss while i was doing a pretty good job holding things up despite how sloppy the group was as a whole .
in particular the tank was not very good taking a lot of damage and the dps were always stealing agro .
we wait for like 5-10 minutes for a tank after getting chewed out by this blm and even though he was a fuck-wad it still got to me a little .
then i had another group things started off rocky because our tank d/c 'd almost right away in the dungeon .
so we waited and got a new tank that was actually rather good .
again i let the group know i was new when we entered the dungeon .
then we got to the second boss fight and before we went in i asked them to explain the mechanics .
they said get the boss to 0 and do n't get rek't '' and then we were in the fight .
the boss did his stupid tunneling underground thing and without another word i got voted out of the party even though i was apologetic to everyone for having gotten killed and therefore causing a wipe .
i feel like i just had some really bad duty finder luck here and got a bunch of assholes who think everyone should automatically be a veteran player but like i said i have n't had any trouble healing before .
i 'm even really good at switching between heals and dps without any problems .
but that said i still have no idea how to do that second fight in cutter 's cry .
any advice on what to do as a healer what to watch out for ?

i am a player that primarily plays conclave in warframe .
once i obtain all the weapons and frames i want from pve i play conclave .
honestly it 's a unique pvp experience that i feel has a lot of potential but if you have tried conclave you were most likely turned away due to the unbalanced and frustrating nature of the game mode .
there are people who argue that warframe is a pve game and therefore conclave will never and should not be balanced .
those that have this view are essentially saying that de should n't work past the obstacles in order to provide us with a more enjoyable experience .
de has made strides to effectively implement pvp into warframe especially with the introduction of the new conclave and the frequent changes made to the conclave .
i know that it is extremely difficult to balance a game especially a one like warframe that has gone through so many drastic changes .
despite the changes to conclave i feel that they are n't aggressive enough .
most of the frames were created without pvp in mind and because of this there are frames that perform drastically better in the conclave than others .
in addition if you actually play conclave regularly then you are aware that there are those go to exploitable weapons '' that are used because they will get you kills .
once those weapons are hit with a nerf more always seem to pop up .
i would like to make a few suggestions simply because i love to see this game grow .
instead of energy abilities would be have cool downs based on how effective they are .
abilities that are used for utility or minor damage would have short to moderate cool downs that are automatically refreshed each time the player dies .
ultimates and abilities that have a big impact on the game would have long cool downs that would that would not reset when the player dies .
these abilities would not be usable at the start of a match .
the player would have to wait for the ability to come of of cool down as if they at used it at the very beginning of the match .
some frames are just better at conclave there is no denying it
abilities of less viable frames would need to be modified to bring them up to par with other frames .
this has already been done to an extent such as ivara 's quiver having different arrows that are n't in pve but this should be done on a larger scale .
i 'm sure someone else is out there who loves pvp but their favorite frames just are n't suited for it .
i know some may not like this suggestion but bring stamina back to conclave only .
melee attacks and bullet jumping consume stamina however it rapidly regenerates .
when the player has no stamina they can still melee but damage is reduced .
although these suggestions are not very in depth i think they could change conclave for the better but as of now conclave just is n't living up to its potential .
as the title says i expect a new map design reveal on 9th of january or even earlier due to swc but for season 2 the map redesign was revealed on 9th of january 2015

i do not know about other parts of the world but in my part of the world depression is not a thing that is usually taken seriously in fact many will just laugh it off .
to them it will come as a shocker to learn that depression is actually a mental disorder .
it presents with such symptoms as persisted sad/anxious mood loss of interest in many things low self-esteem disturbed sleep patterns and variations in appetite lack of energy poor concentration decreased energy irritability and even thoughts of suicide .
according to the world health organization who depression is a worldwide phenomenon affecting over 350 million people as of 2012 .
the who actually estimates that by the year 2020 depression will have risen to 2nd place in the global burden disease listing and by 2030 be well ahead of heart disease world over .
it is now generally agreed that depression is majorly caused by life experiences .
in some cases however genetics play a key factor .
the world federation for mental health also adds that certain personal patterns for example difficulty in handling stress lay fertile ground for the disorder to set in .
today as a result of intensive research that has gone into the illness even those with the most severe depression can get better with treatment .
i watched a video yesterday on super motherload and paperback and these games seem to bring something very unique and exciting to this genre .

hello all i have a question regarding formations and detachments .
i last played in 4th edition so i 'm not used to the new ways armies can be made up .
my question is about whether this would be battle-forged .
if i have a primary detachment that is a combined arms detachment from the chaos space marines codex can i take an imperial knight as an oathsworn detachment '' ?
i understand theyre come the apocalypse allies but i figure the rules restrictions aptly represent a chaos knights psychosis .
or can only armies of the imperium take codex imperial knights as allies ?
this is the man that prevented jack from killing alex at the end of the movie .
he was also at the diner with jack and his daughter and i believe he was looking at jack out of a car window .
in the credits he is simply goatee man '' i 'm looking for any theories as to who people believe this man might be .
i 've seen several threads with people asking for ways to find a name for their characters .
i 'm making this one to help any future writers that come here with the same problem .
keep in mind that this is just what i do .
you do n't have to do it if you think i 'm full of shit .
which is totally fine as long as you do n't tell me that .
you 're going to want to try and draw out a word that summarizes their personality or their role in the story or something that just fits their theme .
for example if you have a really hot-headed character you might come up with anger '' or angry '' or fire '' or asshole '' .
i 'm gon na give a generic example with rage '' .
once you have your word simply search up names that mean your word '' and find something there .
i 'm gon na pretend my character 's a guy .
now look it up in other languages http www.indifferentlanguages.com is fucking sweet for that and find a foreign word that looks cool .
anger '' has got col√®re '' in french which sounds far too soft zorn '' in german which could be cool if your character 's an alien and ira '' in latin which i 'm gon na use .
i think ira '' is the prefix of irate '' .
now just twist around your foreign word till you have something that would fit your character !
you can mix in other words if it 's too short .
anger '' in danish is vrede '' which sounds cool as shit .
oooh shit this motherfucker 's a viking or somethin ' .
stuermer irved the no-bullshit size-of-a-tank german dude is here to mess y'all up .
i thought it would be a fun post to share all our wedding bargains !
weddings can be so expensive sometimes so lets share all the great finds and sweet deals we 've gotten !
my favorites were my wedding dress ¬£8.30 on ebay http i.imgur.com/mdursej.jpg you ca n't see it too well but there 's a small amount of beaded detail on the straps and on the left hip .
not sure if i 'm removing the beads yet or not my wedding rings again an ebay purchase for ¬£42.24 http imgur.com/qzc08gn and the venue for our ceremony in the afternoon .
the venue was booked for a monday because of the date we wanted and so it only cost us ¬£300 !
if we 'd have gone for a weekend it would have been ¬£700 double that if we 'd gone for the whole day !
i remembre testing webgl export for some simple 2d games and it was pretty bad especially for the loading time of the game .
now i 'd like to know if things have changed with the new versions of unity ?
and do you have links to some 2d games made with unity and webgl ?
edit after running some tests it seems that the load time is now down to 9 seconds with my simple 2d project .
that 's better than before but still too long do you know any ways to make this faster ?
this was part of a series of books about an ex military private detective ? .
in this book he goes to a small town in the us with a group of equally tough friends and gets rid of the local thugs .
he was a general bad ass and would say things like it was extremely hot there but because i am hard as nails i was n't bothered by it '' .
the cover was orange and i think the name of the book was the same as the name of the town .
really wanted to watch videos with madvr and svp i assume there is a non-head tracking pure 2d display mode ?
a goat in the shed is safe but that is not what goat 's are made for .
so i went to the first sourcefedlive in la .
i wanted to show some friends the video but it appears to be removed .
i could just be blanking on where it it but if it really is down why is it ?
my game do not appears whenever i click the game it crashed everytime i just can show hawk game '' for 5 seconds and he pull me out to home screen im a iphone user can anyone help me what to do i had a very good inventory and dont want to loose it .

i have green amp fog sport bands on the way now .
yea i figured they started sending me ads for their reduced rates .
i think it depends entirely on the market you 're in .
they recently redid a bunch of the mcd 's in my area and while i would in no way call them upscale dining they are actually quite nice .
they have a lounge fireplace large tvs all over the place and pretty decent coffee .
while their staple foods have basically stayed the same their new offerings are pretty nice .
it seems that they 're trying to become a sort of starbucks+burgers kind of place .
anyone can tell you that football is a dangerous sport .
i think it is a risk many are willing to take .
many professions have their hazards construction oil workers police and fire .
its a risk and i dont agree with people telling others what to do even after the person knows the risk .
it is their life let them love it the way they choose if it does no harm to others and brings them joy .
yep i had it for about 18 years before being diagnosed .
there are websites the detail the odds and probability of various outcomes based off your card total and the dealer 's upcard .

that 's what bugs me and why i go on my rants .
you 're all so dismissive of anyone who does n't subscribe to middle class suburban ideals and has a different take .
came here for lcd lyric puns was not disappointed .
as someone who missed the local show on the last tour due to a massive blowout with my then gf i 'm fucking pumped .
and to address the point of this thread i made quite a lot of sacrifice this summer to see the grateful dead shows in chicago last summer .
dead and co not withstanding if they said tomorrow that they had a ton of fun last summer and were going to do it again .
i would be happy to see more shows and would n't care a bit .
it 's the shows the experience of getting there and being there and of course the music that matter the rest is noise .
kevlar is the starting armor theres also the exosuit and i also saw reinforced kevlar armor in one of the videos my guess for that is its kevlar armor with alien alloys infused into it or something
aw man when i wear my gaming related apparel in public all i get are awkward teenagers nervously trying to start conversations .
i am definitely curious about fondling up that butt hole of yours .
will you also celebrate on february 10 just to cover your bases ?
my view has remained the same and to me unbound opening the door for anything
i do n't care if you do n't plan on abusing unbound because the fact your playing it opens up the game for someone to abuse it
and who is to say exactly what is op i mean taking an extra hq could be as op for one army as taking nothing but flyers for some other army or running nothing but knights of some kind
do n't really see how that 's a bad thing they 're essentially distributing it .
my friend who works as a waitress made about ten thousand more dollars than i did a few years ago as an adjunct professor at a college with an enrollment of over 10,000 people .

the ending i could choose is to nuke the institute with the minutemen but i do n't think i have the right to kill all those peoe .
they have done both good and bad things but so have others .
the institute is not as smart or powerful as they or other people think .
america has a lot of problems which are not mutually exclusive to or necessarily causative of each other .
but if you 're sincerely telling me that america does n't have a gun problem against the backdrop of the mass shootings that have occurred in the past year alone then i do n't know what to tell you dude .
i think the victims of america 's gun violence would consider it a little more than a statistical blip '' as you put it .
meanwhile the rest of the world looks on in horror as america 's firearm aficionados refuse to consider the most basic reforms to attempt to improve the safety of all of its citizens .

the last month i was also in the crystal league 2 and 3 i am currently in silver 1 as mid-th8 .
in crystal i was always smashed by th9 's just for fun never mind the loot that i could offer i am a casual player or by high th8 's due de .
since two days ago in silver 1 i have just obtained cheap shields and the chances of being smashed have fallen sharply .
the loot avaliable in this league is highly variable but affordable at least it fits my game mode .
i have a male friend who is 100 no more than a friend .
neither of us are romantically interested in eachother but we enjoy hanging out ocassionally .
i have made him dinner before and it really did n't even cross my mind to wonder if it was inappropriate because i 've also made dinner for my female friends .
no one has ever assumed we 're a couple either so i guess we do a pretty good job of keeping it platonic .
we do n't snuggle up on a couch or get very close .
it 's not like we have to go out of our way to avoid this it just would n't be natural because there 's no desire for either of us to do that .
i guess it 's hard to give specific examples so maybe just think of him as your brother this helps if you actually have a brother and can directly relate to your behaviour around him .
we could have 5 seasons '' that are 73 days long and then you get 365 days .
not if those lock screen notification are not in the notification center .
i have show in notification center '' turned off for almost everything .
haha wow i did not pick up on what you were implying at all
the thing about mcnulty is that i think he actually wanted to be on the boat .
throughout season 1 he hints about it and at one point he realizes lester is a good cop '' so they go out for drinks and lester gives his backstory and the one piece of advice lester gives him is if they ever ask you where you do n't want to go that 's where they 'll send you '' ... something to that affect .
so at the end of season 1 when rawls is sitting with mcnulty and telling him i want to look out for you and make sure you do n't land anywhere you do n't want to be so tell me where do n't you want to be ? ''
mcnulty has a slight grin on his face thanks to lesters advice and in season 2 we find him on the docks exactly where he wanted to be .
i found bbi way way way harder than anything any of the souls games threw at me .
the giant gore cyclops undead/dragon priest duo the minotaurs and death were all really tricky boss fights .
i went through bbi at 50 i do n't know if that matters .
traditional dd is a walk in the park though .
because one group is protesting the acknowledged provable systematic murder of blacks based on race . ''
for exactly the same reason using population figures for race makes no sense .
if you compare police killings by crimes committed you 'd see it 's a complete lie .
with 60 of violent crime committed by blacks largely on blacks the police are having to deal with predominantly black criminals .
saying there is systematic murder of blacks is such a gross and blatant pile of shit you really should be far more angry at blm than these nutters in oregon .
blm willfully lie and support some of the most malevolent pieces of human garbage ever to grace this planet simply because of their skin color .
it is a horrible group doing horrible things and if they keep it up they 're going to have to start wearing bed sheets and burning holy symbols on people 's lawns or in their case on highways and in airports .
this is one of the most hillarious things i have ever seen
you 'd be a fool to think brady has never taken anything illegal too .

you 'll need a diffuser some co2 proof '' hose and ideally a co2 indicator as well but those things are all cheap little addons .
i personally use liquid co2 instead of pressurized shrimp tanks so i dont want to risk suffocating them so i cant give a first hand recommendation for any particular system .
i have n't listened to this series by dan carlin but if his series on the mongols is anything to go by i personally think a history of rome '' is more fun as well .
the chancellor of my old uni called in the police on some students who had been protesting in the quad because she did n't like what it was doing for the image of the school .
and she authorized the police to use force to remove them .
here 's what happened the students sat in a circle holding hands while the cops used some military grade pepper spray on them that civilian police departments are n't even supposed to have .
some cops had to leave the department but they kept their pensions basically an early retirement and when basically everybody faculty staff students even f*ing jon stewart told the chancellor she should resign she just refused and nothing happened .
not what i 'm saying at all just that it could happen .
the article talks of historical uncertainty in the '70s and '80s the fact that we managed to mostly ban cfcs in 1989 and as a result of the the ban the ozone hole has been smaller recently than it has been since the '80s .
even the error bars in the graphs are small .
you 're talking like this is some sort of soft science it 's physics .
i know but i still like to access stuff like miiverse and i think the badge arcade requires an nnid confirmation but whenever i get to that screen it gives me an error .
ok i 've heard a lot of people say to drink water to suppress appetite but it does n't do that for me so i 'm glad to hear that .
also i feel if i drink too much water with my meals i do n't seem to digest as well .
i wonder if that is because it dilutes my stomach acids .
so i drink water mainly long after meals and only what is needed during the meal itself .
i 've been toying around with the idea of harvesting the switches from mine for a project looks like i 'll have to look into having some plates cut .

you can get food stamps starting at 130 of the federal poverty line fpl .

i hate this i do n't like what someone is saying so let 's ban him from the country '' malarkey .
we listen to him debate him and challenge him thats the right way to defeat an opinion you disagree with not ban them from speaking or entering the country .
it 's actually a bit embarrassing this will even be debated .
i was going to drop andrew luck for derek carr but go lucky and snagged bortles instead .

um people do criticize indian entertainment a lot and i 'm assuming south korean as well for not representing the population so i do n't know where you getting that from .
and what do you mean by your '' respective industries ?
this seems like you view asian-whatever as outsiders rather than belonging to your group whether that is america canada etc .
this is an argument to increase representation so the majority does n't just believe whatever trope about minorities they are fed .
based on the 2013 census only 63 of americans are non-hispanic white and the other 37 is definitely not represented in the media .
people are arguing not only for more representation but accuracy and variety in that representation .
otherwise the majority can obtain unhealthy views of minorities .
there should not just be tyranny of the majority because it can lead to oppression of the minority .
i hope this satisfied some of your genuine curiosity .
that had to be at least 15 feet while frozen .

i uploaded it because i thought it was the best ot this year and i knew it needed it be shared asap .
one was standing in front of a computer for 20 minutes to do a 5 minute task and when we asked him how things were progressing he just looked up at us and said oh ... uh..
then there was the time he tried to convince the entire staff and a few customers standing nearby that white people are the result of a tribe of movin ' around albino africans and they evoluted into white people . ''
and pointed to a coworker with vitiligo to prove is point claiming dude acts white so he 's turning white . ''
when we asked if he had any children while helping him fill out his benefits paperwork he said no .
at the holiday party he came in with his three-year-old daughter .
when we asked him why he said he did n't have any children he said oh ... yeah she was staying at her moms that week and i forgot . ''
he finally turned in his two week notice after he was written up for telling a supervisor me that he would n't put his phone away while at work because his dudes be callin ' me . ''
one of the reasons he cited for leaving was that when he asked if he could try and sell his mix tape to customers we said no .

as for xur it seems fairly accepted he released skolas granted though those are from the grimoire so vanguard probably had no idea
he 'd also learned how to make oracles in the vault .
i really wish they would have linked the how story into th whole though .
if xur did in fact release skolas then that would implicate it was a plan from the nine .
the queen already stated she did n't agree with them would have interesting to learn more about them some people think the nine might even be the nine warminds .
in my personal opinion it was worth getting into but they did not handle it well and it is not a huge loss to lose the team .

teri fahrendorf has a great article somewhere on how to plan a beer lineup and brew for a brewpub opening .
it was intensively detailed including when to borrow yeast for each batch .
one of her points was that it 's difficult for a brewpub that 's turning 4-5 brews a week to maintain more than 3 maybe 4 yeast strains .
it goes to demonstrate how hard it is for your casual 25x per year brewer to maintain 4-6 strains .

you 'd have to know the exact test the fbi performed using the same methods and under the same conditions .
that would be impossible to replicate at this point .
all that aside in a perfect scenario all we could do is verify that the fbi 's test is capable of producing false negatives .
but we 'd still have absolutely no way of knowing whether the blood from the rav4 contained edta unless we developed a more accurate test for edta and then re-tested the stain .
to make matters worse at this point the blood stain is more than 10 years old .
even if there were edta in it at the time it might be gone now .
was the dash panel with the blood stain on it removed and placed in storage somewhere ?
is there just some solution in a vial that contains remnants of the blood stain ?
was everything just destroyed in the course of testing ?
if there really is edta in that blood and it 's allowed to be tested again then they might be able to detect it .
but if they re-rest it and don't find edta i 'm afraid the questions will simply never be answered .
with really good tests we could say with a great deal of certainty that there 's no edta in it now .
but who knows about ten years after the fact when god knows what has happened to the evidence in the interim .
dominion and the dc comics deckbuilding game both have attack cards that hinder opponents by giving them dud cards/negative points or by making them discard .
they both also have defense cards which can be used to nullify the attack if they 're in your hand at the time .

i 've made three comments already relating barcelona success story as what i expected for brazil .
and i feel the bastard approach they 've taken in brazil is the exact opposite of what should have been done .
instead of a top-down approach just pointing the finger and building shit and worrying about who gets the contracts it should have started with clearing the city of its petty ailments from the bottom up .
clean the fucking roads and rivers pay the people in the favelas to move the fuck out or literally give them keys to newly built housing repair and expand the public transport shit that is the bleeding lifeline to much of the population .
case and point is how much brazilians hated the world cup and how much they are complaining about the upcoming olympics .
they 're not thinking fuck me this is gon na make us a shit ton of money ! ! ''
no they 're thinking fucking rat bastard politicians robbing us of funding for schools/hospitals only to put on a show for the world to think we 're okay when we 're actually dying here !

pinatubo did have a massive effect on the earth 's climate in the short term because of the huge amount of particulate matter it released into the upper atmosphere .
the eruption caused global temperatures to drop by about 1 degree f over the next 15 months .
http earthobservatory.nasa.gov/iotd/view.php ? id=1510 however volcanoes actually emit very little co2 compared to human activity http volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/climate.php and the particulate aerosols they do emit have much shorter residence times than co2 does .
radiative forcings are processes that change the energy balance between the earth 's atmosphere and space and cause it to reach a new equilibrium temperature .
these include things like changes in greenhouse gas concentrations changes in the amounts of reflective aerosols in the atmosphere changes in albedo due to cloud cover or biosphere changes and changes in the amount of sunlight reaching the earth due to orbital variation and variation in solar output .
internal variability refers to heat cycling throughout the earth itself such as el nino and la nina where heat cycles into and out of the deep oceans .
the point behind all of this is that the temperature of the earth does not just change for no reason there are measurable physical processes that drive it .
man didnt create the midieval warming period the little ice age or the 18 year period of climate stability .
the medieval warm period is thought to have been primarily caused by internal variability and was not a global event .
it was a period of increased warmth in parts of the northern hemisphere that resulted mainly from changes in ocean currents .
the ice age cycle is primarily driven by orbital variation and mediated by co2 and albedo feedbacks .
the 18 year period of climate stability '' is simply a cherrypicked statistical artifact .
you can look through nearly any real life time-series showing an increase in anything and fish out certain stretches that do not match the long-term trend .
it 's just another instance of the type of thinking displayed in this graphic http www.skepticalscience.com/graphics/skepticsvrealists_500.gif and betrays a lack of rigorous understanding of the subject and of data analysis in general .
man can help out where it can but it doesnt mean that liberals should suffocate the economy .
one of the main purposes of curbing carbon emissions is to prevent economic damages down the line .
a properly implemented carbon tax for example is widely considered by economists to be favorable for the global economy and actually lead to growth since it internalizes a market externality and allows the market to function more in line with how it is supposed to .
in the long term nearly all mitigation and adaptation policies are aimed at maximizing economic growth .
these guys cant predict the weather for next month what makes you think they can be over decades oh yeah there not .

my mom got me two pairs of these black work pants for christmas they 're actually really great .

also new york and company has these pull-on work '' pants that are really comfy and would probably work for a long time .

in the beginning in the very beginning there was hunger .
that was all there was this hunger this want this need .
we consumed and used the energy we gained to consume more .
the words came later a poor translation from truth to brain to words those imperfect messengers of need .
the remnants of the broken must be consumed and cleansed .
she did n't know what was meant by broken what the eldrazi even thought of as whole so they could compare and know what was broken .
perhaps to those monstrosities everything that was real that was the world was broken .
there were many aways from zendikar and the eldrazi knew in so far as they could know anything they should be there and not here .
but they were here and their purpose was to consume and so they did .
so emrakul and maybe the others seems to have a mission the remnants of the broken must be consumed and cleansed . ''
ooookayyy so what the heck is that supposed to mean ?
have they been moving toward some particular area or plane for eons and other planes are just snacks along the way ?

for most of the middle east including iraq and syria this would mean before the first world war when they were loosely governed by the ottoman empire which i would n't consider part of 'the west ' .
i see you 've also referred to libya which was occupied by the italians in 1911 .
iraq and libya were at war for much of those periods so no i would not consider them stable .

thanks for the response i thought there had to be and it makes sense that it would vary based on the location .
my point with this is n't to say hey let 's do what other sports do . ''
i know cheating in cs is pretty varied because for example esea and valve have separate anti-cheat systems .
i have n't really thought about it but i would dare to suggest that match-fixing for the amounts that ibp did is much less of a crime than cheating when looked at big picture .
this was a single isolated incident affected one single match and the monetary gain was apparently '' in the low thousands something around 3,500 i believe ? .
whereas cheating is a consistent effort that affects multiple matches over a longer period of time and has the ability to put someone in a position to be recruited by a team go further in a tournament or place higher in a league and therefore potentially create a much higher monetary gain .
i 've read a couple but it 's not my thing .

i might do that after i 'm done with this upcoming semester in college .
end game i like the concept of building bigger but intricate things which costs a lot of stacks and by extension inventory space .
i like what others are saying about a dsu-alike backpack .
my addition is for it to have x '' upgrade slots which can be outfitted to do things like allow more item types depth of storage refill stacks in your inventory ability to hook into ae system and pick up more items automatically and finally to extreme endgame generate certain materials automatically with whitelist in config/commands .
just some ideas but hopefully it gets you rolling on it .

not sure if you 're being intentionally obtuse or argumentative but i 'm fairly sure u/qqqyqnz 's point has the understood addendum of return to a group where they are in the majority again in the same culture/country '' .
that 's the difference between being a situational minority in a college class and a minority in the political sense where the culture they grow up in is one in which they are underrepresented .
there is nowhere in this country where minorities can actually escape from the overarching reality of that underrepresentation .
i 'm going to assume you do n't mean they can always go back to where they come from '' because that would just be ludicrously un-american .
that kind of makes me worry that there is something wrong hardware wise if you 're having the same issue but using a different fitness tracker app .

basically mechanical keyboard supposed to be better than normal rubber dome generally it will last longer because it uses mechanical switches rather than rubber membrane at the normal keyboard that will wear off faster than mechanical switch .
mechanical keyboards have options from the clicky clacky switches to the more quiet one .
also there 's harder keypress and the softer one .
some people will even go custom made their keyboard not only the keycaps but the whole keyboard so you can actually make them as pretty as you like .
circlejerks happened in many stuff but yeah some mechanical keyboard user feel more superior than the normal rubber dome keyboard user because mechanical keyboards are more expensive generally has better build quality and also supposedly feel much more better according to them .
mocking rubber dome keyboard user is something like rubber dome is shit we are using the better stuff here '' yes something like the internet explorer analogy described earlier .
but really try out some of the switches if you can and see if any of them feel better according to you .
if not then it 's okay it 's always different cup for different people

go have a look at the hw grand prix that strikeforce put on just before they wrapped up .
when daniel cormier was brought in as a replacement it launched his career into the limelight and his efforts alongside his olympic history was why he was so well respected .
his fight with josh barnett was his hardest before meeting jones and is a great display for both fighters .
the other fights in the tourney are n't as exciting but are very interesting stylistically .
other highlights from strikeforce include ronda 's ascension and miesha as top dog their match is excellent .
nick diaz and paul dayley had one of the most action packed 1 rd fights ever with fedor and henderson challenging them for that title .
speaking of fedor checkout his strikeforce run in chronological order you will be watching the end of his reign as the last emporer and his status as the current p4p great stepping aside for anderson .
you could probably watch his whole career through pride affliction and strikeforce if you were up for it .
the list is huge for pride but the various grand prix especially the one with chuck rampage overeem and a number of other huge names are must watches .
a few of the freakshow fights are entertaining but of the unlikely matches wanderlei vs mark hunt is one of those brain busting matches .
you would also be wise to watch what a juicy wandy could do his fights with rampage are almost too much to watch .

first day back at work today after two weeks home in the cold in snowy ottawa canada .
i only arrived back yesterday after an overnight flight woke up at 7 this am without a clue where i was or why my alarm was going off when it was still dark assumed it was a mistake at first as i 've gotten used to sleeping until i woke up and by this point it is no longer dark out .
anyway it was nice to get back to cycling to work .
everyone i cycled with or close to behaved themselves .
and i 'm currently feeling much better about being back in this home where i can bike year round .
one of them is calling bernie volunteers to help coordinating action .
the other thing is basically simply asking people if they will vote clinton or sanders .
but i want to argue that there 's actually nothing wrong in convincing people .
would it be wrong if a foreigner tried to convince an american that global warming actually exists ?
it is actually desirable for the world to engage in such a discussion .
now someone can say but this is different because it 's a candidate .
you 're providing people with points that they can choose to use when deciding which candidate they will choose .
if they eventually use some of the intellectual ingredients which you 've provided then it was a good thing that you did so not a bad thing .
if at first sight this seems wrong it 's only because unconsciously we associate politics with a scam .
so we think that a conversation in this context is a scam .
if you 're providing good points for people to be able to do better choices then it is very desirable and laudable .
to sum it up the whole point about democracy is letting someone choose what the best candidate is by weighing all the information .
the more information a person has the better democracy works .
it does n't matter where that information comes from .
if an american decides that he will read brittish newspapers to get that information that 's perfectly fine .
if information is accurate/relevant it does n't matter if the person spreading that information is a foreigner since it is contributing to the quality of democracy .
if information is inaccurate/irrelevant it 's still as inaccurate or irrelevant if the person spreading that information is an american .
so the problem is not the identity of the people spreading information but the quality of information itself .

since every other part i pointed out is specified in the traffic code and the additional part where you have to clear a junction as quickly as possible there really is no reason to assume anything i 've said is wrong even in the eyes of the law .
the only reason i bring it up is because i see quite a lot unfortunately people creating dangerous situations just because they absolutely want to drive all the way to the end before switching lanes .

the problem is mediatek has always been very closed about sources and while some of the mi devices mi4 mi3 mi4i and mi4c have gotten sources released and even have a working daily build not official cm13 the lower end redmi range are economy devices and xiaomi does not take them as seriously development wise
the redmi 1 was mediatek 6589t and was abandoned at android 4.2 the 1s has a snapdragon 400 and was abandoned at 4.4.2 but has a working cm12 12,1 and 13. and the redmi 2 is snapdragon 410 and also have working cm only becuase its qualcomm .
the mediatek devices have little hope of getting cm13 or marshmellow in any way becuase theres no sopport either from xiaomi or from mediatek .

monsters are weaker when dealing with someone who has a lot of hate and they are also weaker if they do n't want to fight .
asriel is still a monster and chara has a lot of hate .
chara is asriel 's best friend so asriel might have trouble actually attacking .
if chara utterly destroyed flowey they would attack likely asriel with the same amount of hatred .
besides assuming chara is max lv they could tank a lot of asriel 's flashy moves .
chara does n't need the one hit kill that will probably happen .
you guys were by far the best team in the east and kept losing games with coaching calls in the final minutes .

what it does do however is introduce massive amounts of materials to the economy .
if the dungeon nerf was a way to reduce the liquid gold incoming to the game the scribe craft might have been a way to add more drains of various materials .

greetings and salutations to all readers and pilots in the year 3302 !
let us all hope that the new year will bring new levels of cooperation and effective operations for all commanders loyal to the empire .
the citizens of amuzgo and dongkum were not won over by the shadow president 's supply lines of liberal aide .
sources indicate that the local corporations will look favourably on the shadow president 's liberal aide '' so all imperial eyes are hopeful that some power player less beholden to local corporations will appeal to them .
last week was a show of force from every loyal commander in the form of logistics .
nearly two dozen systems influenced by those powers hostile to the emperor experienced debilitating levels of criminal undermining last week but all three bodies politic endured the storm .
with the galactic poll calculating the emperor 's political will at a staggering 686 units of command capital it is of primary importance that pilots pledged to the emperor establish a solid preparation list early and continue to push them inspite overwhelmingly wealthy special interests who are not seeking the betterment of the emperor 's political base .
systems which can return over 62cc are the only systems of benefit to the kamadhenu political machine working tirelessly for its patron the emperor arissa lavigny-duval .
the current expansion in kartenes is not a system which returns political will back to kamadhenu .
early suggestions for preparation targets are hrun tujil and kherthaje .
for those of a military mind there will be combat targets worth participating but thankfully there are no instances of encroaching political players on systems already pledged to the emperor .
both shadow president winters and pirate lord archon delaine have multiple expansions into densely populated regions of space ongoing and rumours of a sustained campaign to undermine the authority of hudson delaine and winters have spread throughout the past several weeks .
i levelled my herblore skill i am now level 98 .
i have a lot of thoughts constantly running around my head .
like how i dropped out of highschool last year started drinking got arrested for underage drinking had an epiphany again and felt better than i had in months got a job and then quit that job because i could n't handle the pressure and now i 'm back to square one .
we really needed that money i really needed to keep that job .
and i let everyone down because i could n't handle it just like i could n't handle school .
i am trying to find a new job but i have no motivation .
i know you have to make your own motivation it does n't always come to you .
i wish i would just get hit by a car or crack my head open because i can not do it to myself because it will break my family .
i have tried too many times and failed and if i try again and fail i will break my mom and i ca n't do that to her again .
of course i 'm scared of death but if i died in an accident they could get past it they 'd have more food and money for themselves and they would n't have to deal with their failure of a daughter anymore .
i wish i would just drop dead because it literally would be better for everyone .
i just do n't know how much more i can take of feeling this empty and horrible inside .
c/o 440 pure in days not sure how long though
should we just not reply to them dont let it take any of your time we know now that no one seems to check the f.a.q and getting frustrated over it just not worth it .
so my therapist is going to sit down with me and we are going to go through the test that determines any major psychological disorders i forget what the test is actually called .
after we do that she is going to give me my letter for the endo .
should i be feeling this anxious/nervous about the test ?
i know that other than depression anxiety gender dysphoria and suicidal ideation which hits when my depression is at its lowest i have nothing wrong with me so why am i so nervous that it 'll go horribly wrong ?
so a guy walks into a bar ... . where does he go next ?
guys i know everyone 's nipples are all a-tingle with having discovered the morales-raynor combo and sure it 's a great combination but that does n't mean you absolutely have to pick morales anytime there 's a raynor on your team .
sometimes she 's just not a great pick especially against heavy spread damage like kael/sylvanas/jaina and even more so when you do n't have a comp with strong disengage potential .
just take an extra 2-3 seconds to think about the team comps and decide whether morales is actually the right pick .
now that winter in maine is showing up for real i am considering setting up on a lake .
i figure it 's flat firm stable and has better access to open sky .

those who threw their dk2 out the window in anger over the 599 pricetag if you have the usb/hdmi cable assembly still intact i 'd like to buy it off you .
my bunny chewed through mine and i planned to buy the cv1 so it was not so much of a problem yet at this price i kind of just want my dk2 to work again .
i posted some screenshots for an earlier version of the game not too long ago .
i have been working on a doom rpg fan game for a long time .
the basic gist of it would be you control the survivors of a squad of marines sent to investigate a distress signal from a colony on mars .
there would be 5 total marines each with a special skill needed to progress but you can only take 3 with you at a time meaning you would have to break the group up .
the point of the game would be to recover these hard drives that the uac is using to back up their data so the earth military can understand what you are up against .
total drives each drive telling the story of what went down at the base .
however it would be completely optional to collect these drives .
want to just push through the base and hit the portal to hell ?
to get the best ending though you would have to collect them all .
the game would play similarly to sweet home '' a famicom survival horror game from the late 80s which was the predecessor to resident evil .
the problem i just ran into is in the form of the story .
it is near identical to the story information given in the game informer article .
i understand that it 's doom and that there is n't much in the way of story .
from what they have revealed though the games plot is basically going to be exactly the same as the plot for my fan game and i 've been working on it on and off for years already !
hell the story would even be told similarly relying more on the player reading data logs and less on cutscenes and scripted events .
so i am sort of at an impasse here .
should i scrap the story entirely and completely rewrite the plot ?
would people still be interested in playing it if i kept the plot i 've been going with so far ?

pastry cream in my danishes are delicious but it tastes even better before it 's in the danish .
it 's smooth and velvety after baking it still tastes good but a little stiff and and chunky .
is it okay to put it in after baking ?
cooking at 370f for 20 min just enough to brown the egg glaze on the danishes .
if i do n't put it in the center of the danish will rise .
this thread will focus on the 2nd world in my 7 world long mario game .
all levels focus on being visually pleasing and having fun unique gameplay .
this game ai n't too focused on a spesified theme in each world since i want every stage to vary in gameplay .
the levels all focus on being visually pleasing and having fun semi-traditional gameplay .
the game is a little harder than normal mario games .
while some stages might look semi-hard at first glance the amount of items it gives out can make it more fitting in difficulty .
find the beetle helmet and keep it through the stage .
try to speedrun the stage and get a good time .
you can see how good your time is compared to the authors speedrun '' to see how well you 've done .
you can find these speedruns on my youtube channel or as a comment when clearing the stage .
before presenting you with the level codes themself i 'd like to present a short trailer showcasing the levels
an airship and water level that focus a lot on the usage of ice blocks .
you can do tons of exploration on this stage and is even a speedrun road to avoid the water section .
a pretty big grassland level that focus a lot on chain chomps .
a ghost house level with focus on moving platforms with cannons on them .
got 3rd place in boss contest with the non-improved '' version of this stage .
1st part consist of very fast autoscrolling through an area that got many roads to chose from every road is right .
2nd part is bouncing on para koopas and jumping of falling platforms .
1st part is exploration area while 2nd part is clever p-switch run area .
the stage focus around a castle level filled with clouds in it .
it also uses enemies in the lakitu cloud in a fair manner .
you 'll escape fight a bowser in cloud at the end .
i got videoes with both finding every secret and doing speedrun of my stages on my youtube channel if you 're interested in checking them out
i 'd really appreciate anything you got to say about my levels and hope you 'll look forward to my world 3 post when that comes out as well
not sure which subreddit to post it too but after reading maybe someone can tell me where to go .
yesterday i got my phone a 64 gb iphone 6 stolen out of my hands while in phnom pehn .
i immediately went to find my iphone on a friends phone and locked the phone and put it into erase mode because there was no way i could get back here .
i still had the original sim card because i had a cambodian sim card in there while im in the country .
today i went to buy a replacement phone at an apple reseller store here and i put in my original sim .
after getting all set up i went to photos to see if my photo stream would upload and it did but then i was asked something about icloud sharing and i clicked ok but after i clicked it i immediately lost all my photos .
if anyone could give me some help on getting them back or telling me what i did wrong that would be amazing because there was a lot of memories in there that i really do n't want to lose .
some backround info i was never good at school/suck at working on own initiative/i have adhd so do n't even try to bring up focus '' i always liked people/talkative/social dropped out of school got back into school in it graduated with above average grades .
so in norway where i live you 're required to do 2 years as an intern before you get your degree and im 6 months in .
basically my boss sysadmin hates me because im not what he expected '' and i feel like the heavy protection from the internship is the only thing that 's keeping me from getting fired .
i would like to know what you as sysadmins would expect from an intern with no earlier work experiance and some tips for aquiring attractive skills in the line of work .
this is just a little flavour post i wrote because i was bored .
it 's to recognize that venetian ships have started showing up in stockholm .
hrm that 's a quite a lot of potash you have there .
it 's great stuff i just need someone to give me a decent price . ''
best i can give you is fifteen ducats for the lot . ''
shipping it to lubeck alone is costing me nearly this much plus it 's just going to take up space until i can sell it .
it 's not often somebody comes by looking for this sort of thing .
i 'm not selling this to you for pennies .
sven marched back to his wagon and strapped the cover back on the potash .
after securing the ropes he mounted the cart and began searching for another merchant ship along the docks .
as he pulled out the hanseatic merchant called after him y'know every other merchant on the dock is going to give you the same price !
i ca n't control what the hansa mandates ! ''
sven brushed him off with a rude gesture before making his way along the docks .
winter fell swiftly this year as sven recalled and the cold bit at his toes .
this was the last bit of potash he could get out of the ground for the year as the ground froze solid making potash mining difficult .
along the docks merchants were buying and selling all sorts of goods .
iron from prussia northern herring a favourite of sven 's salt from luneburg and plenty of lumber were all being bought and sold along the docks .
in the distance sven could see two massive ships being erected .
sven must 've been noticeable awestruck because a passer-by quipped yup those are the two ships herr sten has commissioned .
here-tell is that they 're going to fight the saracen moslems when they 're finished .
i think think they 're to drive out the danskjavlar . ''
sven continued along the docks until he reached a peculiar looking ship bearing a flag with a golden lion atop .
the ship was low in the water unlike anything the hansa would trade in .
the sails were triangular and the ship had a great deal of oars .
standing by the docks were two men dressed in bright vibrant clothes unlike anything he 'd ever seen before .
the men spoke in italian to a confused looking man .
it seems that they had just docked and were trying to pay their harbour fees .
the harbour master could n't understand a word they were saying .
i know you 're from venice already just pay the damned fee ! ''
for god 's sake christoph they do n't understand swedish .
the venetian man let out an excited cry ja !
sven let the venetians finish their business before approaching them .
the venetians spoke in a thick accent exotic to sven .
well see i 've got this potash here i 'm looking to sell . ''
after showing off the product the venetians looked awestruck .
just dug up over the course of this week . ''
i 'll give you sixty ducats for the lot . ''
if you 'd rather i buy it for sixteen that can be arranged however i did mean sixty yes . ''
sven helped the venetian sailors load the potash onto the ship and made his way back to home with sixty ducats weighing him down .
on the way back he was able to bring bread and herring for his children .
i 'm puzzled that our good will did n't find any response from kiev authorities .
all attempts to communicate with representatives of ukraine to pass them prisoners failed .
i can imagine how he took cellphone and told hey kiev want to see your pow ?
without dialing a number and next day told above .
while volunteer organizatons poke them 24/7 and their dear friend ruban is even given a special position in kiev to do the same officially .
remember some ukrainian general says that ukraine sucks dnr rocks '' news ?
https news.pn/en/russiainvadedukraine/143866 this source is not the best but i 'm lazy to find better .
ruban is a soviet general who 's brother serves in russian army .
he 's literally their agent in kiev only tolerated as russians are ok to deal with him for prisoners exchange .
and plotnitsky wants to say that he was n't able to contact him ?
this will become an essence of russia 's politics for nearest year steal gas from genichensk give it back brag how noble you are propose prisoner release do nothing blame other side for not taking what you give .
edit a little forecast for dnr exchange https www.reddit.com/r/ukrainianconflict/comments/3zuny1/donetsk_republic_prepares_for_prisoner_swap_with it 's fake too and will end in similarly dumb way .
have you ever thought 'there must be something wrong with me ' even though you have no idea what ?
i ca n't seem to keep friends and i have no idea why .
sometimes it 's because they 've moved far away and i do n't keep great contact that i will admit .
but for local friends they just give me the slow fade and i have no idea why .
i know i 'm a nice person i 'd do anything for anyone .
i think of others first before i think of myself .
perhaps i might be a little whiny but i do n't believe overly so but i could be wrong about that .
i asked my husband who is kind of an asshole about 'telling the truth ' like he said my cornbread was disgusting when i made it for supper for his dad 's birthday and will say the truth regardless of it hurting feelings .
he said he really had no idea b/c all he sees is me doing for other people .
like this past year i was friends with lots of ladies from school .
not super close bffs or anything but they 'd always invite me out to happy hour .
i hung out with a few during the summer and it was always a nice time .
then in august when school started i was not invited to anything .
they stopped texting me back the ones that i was friends with over the summer .
i just deleted them all from my fb bc if they do n't care about me i do n't need to see their lives on display .
i just i just do n't know what 's so wrong with me .
not to pat my own back or be all i am such a christian i am awesome '' b/c that 's not how i truly roll but i wanted to mention it in case you all thought i was selfish or something .
i do n't really want to be a loner but it 's looking like that 's what i 'm gon na be .
i am serious when i say if any bromos wan na meet up with me in central florida i 'm down .
maybe y'all tell me why i suck and i can work on it .
i tried the p2p lending subreddit as advised from a blog .
my credit is shot due to my mother while i was growing up .
i 've been working on it slowly but surely .
however my score is still too low for obtaining a bank loan .
i 've applied to a few online being turned down .
not wanting to apply to many in order to avoid hard hits on my credit score .
and i 'd much rather not jump into the shark tank .
i get paid weekly and do n't want to draw out a long term loan .
just something to kick start my bills and get me caught up .
any advice is welcome on what direction i could go ?
just getting back to mc have n't played in a while .
anyone wan na do some survival and teach me some stuff ?
hi i just wan na know where i can pg my ed 40 lvl 36 mlvl with items .
i can waste like 1kk-1,5kk i wan na get 80 as fast as possible .
please tell me where i can go and what i should use there .
i was hunting spike and i was getting like 200-230k/h with ava .
landmines are spawning all over the map in cars/vans shops and people are getting loads in a matter of hours.we managed to get 33 landmines in 1hour because we found a lot of feralizers and mines very quickly .
personally this has got ta be an oversight on the new loot dispertion because this should n't be happening
can we please have some confirmation by daybreak so hopefully this will be fixed
basically i met this girl when i was back visiting family and we clicked instantly we hung out a few times while i was there and since ive been back home we 've pretty much talked constantly .
we 're both falling for each other and have been trying to make plans to visit each other somewhere halfway between where we live .
is it just not viable to date someone so far away ?
we 're both pretty affectionate people so being away from each other is a bit of a problem .
i know this might sound dumb as we only met a month ago but its something i 'm going to have to deal with .
tl dr girl and i falling for each other but we live 4 hours away from eachother .
i have install tails on usb manually but for persistent volume i need to use tails installer .
i clone to sd card or usb but when try to boot it does not work .
it says installation 100 complete in tails but sd or usb is not even recognized .
it only works when i manually install tails not if done by clone .
something else is wrong if you ca n't get to the tails splash screen on the sandisk .
i 've seen problems before where the 1st usb created by a usb installer will not include all of the files needed for the tails clone and installed 2nd usb to boot correctly .
try installing tails to the 1st 2gb usb using rufus instead http rufus.akeo.ie
change the drop down for bootable disk using '' from freedos to iso image .
click on the button to the right of the iso image and select the tails iso from the file manager .
ready should be displayed near the bottom of the rufus window .
boot from the rufus installed tails usb to install tails to the sandisk usb using the tails installer .
note you may still have the hang problem with the sandisk drive but at least you can use the workaround for that once you are able to get a tails boot screen .
is there a way to manually install tails and configure persistent volume ?

long story short i 've always prerred supportive roles to straight dps roles and have n't played diablo since vanilla pre ah getting removed .
coming back this patch been goofing off some on ptr sader and wd but i feel once live hits i 'm going to prefer group play in general and i figured i 'd like to run a support barb next season as what i focus on gearing up .
i 'll prolly just roll barb as my first class so i 'll have the set beyond that what is the build with the most crossover to support gear that i can try and kill two birds with one stone .
also how does support work even like from what i gathered from the build on diablofans you basically just whirlwind around and group everything up stun it and buff/debuff as needed ?
i 'm completely okay with that if that 's how it works i 'm just not quite sure if i 'm missing something the guide i read was pretty bare bones gear/stat/skill priorities with no explanation which i 'm fine with but i just dont have all the baseline knowledge that 's expected .
i have n't been able to really find any videos or well written guides
would he wear the armor as a keepsake for instance ?
perhaps garden and help his neighbors build a shed ?

i wanted to switch to fi months ago but i owed a lot on my galaxy s6 and i never really had any problems with verizon .
after the phone got damaged at the bar i ordered a replacement .
i had a brand new phone in the box that i could sell .
so i pulled the trigger paid off my phone and cancelled verizon .
everything went smoothly until i tried to sell the phone .
i had n't used that site in years and i forgot about the scammers that come out of the woodwork .
i had to list it twice and both times the winning bidders were scammers .
then i had to call ebay because they charged me a fee for both sales and would n't let me relist it .
i did n't know that i could set itto only accept bids from people with paypal .
swappa was ok but i only got low-ball offers .
long story short i actually sold it on craigslist .
after sorting through a bunch of ghetto emails i found that only one person seemed serious .
we set up the exchange at the bar next door and he actually showed up on time and gave me the cash .
i handed the money over to the barkeep to check the bills .
we chatted for a bit and off he went .
i understand there are a lot of variables i 'm not considering here but bare with me
my fiance and i are 29 years old getting married in august .
we pull in 200k increases 5 yearly a year and have around 25k in existing student debt but with low interest .
we have 50k in cash saved up but could probably move closer to 100k if we move around money from our 401k .
we have rented in boston for several years rent is currently 2k/month and rising .
we plan on moving out of the city to start a family but not for at least 2-3 years .
sell condo at the end of 2-3 years and move to the burbs .
hypothesis buying and selling the condo over the course of 3 years will be cheaper than renting for the next 3 years .
things that i 'm worried about disproving my hypothesis hoa fees pmi fees interest on loans tax insurance closing costs boston 's housing bubble blowing up in my face after the purchase
tldr is it cheaper to rent in boston for the next 3 years for 2,300 a month considering rent will go up or to buy a condo/apt for 500k and sell it in 3 years ?

this is really good news for contributors and consumers alike
thank you valve please continue this trend into 2016 !
it just reminds me that other people are getting discounts and i 'm not .
so i decided to roll for the first time with very close friends at home .
being an experienced/regular mj user i was more than ready for a new mind-altering substance ... !
i took around 150mg and about 1 hour in i did start feeling something .
i felt excited my upper lip started to get a little sweaty music was more profound empathy was enhanced ...
i took another half dose a couple of hours after but the intensity did n't increase .
i just felt very much awake and focussed a little clumsy .
i 'd heard about the effects like euphoria bruxism super empathy altered sense of touch etc but none of that really happened to me .
is it common for first timers to not get that ?
i do have to say that the sex was mindblowingly fun .
so it was n't like i did n't enjoy it i guess the experience was just very mild compared to the things i heard .
my friend recently moved to katy and is looking for recommendations on group salsa classes .

puerto rico and the virgin islands should be made states especially considering puerto rico just defaulted on their debt so they 're practically debt-free .
make nations like jamaica the bahamas etc all states if they want it !
while these sort of things are usually thought of as a crazy in the short term they have historically paid off louisiana purchase alaska ...
i 've been lurking in this forum for a while .
you perform quick kills by pulling off a stealth kill or knocking someone off balance and then attacking them .
sometimes while performing this move time slows to give you a better look at the kill animation i 'm not referring to the special kills on assassination targets like the pendeltons or moves using blood thirsty .
is there any way to increase the occurrence of this slow-mo ?
adjusting kill cam frequency in settings only seems to effect crossbow kills .
is there an ini file i could edit or something ?
i 've got a fever and the only prescription is more cowbell .
well first of all it means obviously that the front office does n't think that ryan johansen is part of their plans going forward .
they felt that a center of his caliber can be found in other ways and that ryan johansen can be replaced .
it also means that they think seth jones can do a lot for our defense .
let 's address both of these topics one at a time .
so one of the first things everyone is going to bring up his this tweet https twitter.com/ryanjohansen19/status/628248345559994368 of johansen 's showing his commitment to the club or whatever .
a short article from the cannon http www.jacketscannon.com/2014/9/16/6222819/ryan-johansen-contract-extension reminds us that we are n't far removed from a long contract extension dispute between ryan johansen and the blue jackets management .
it reminds us that he got scratched in the ahl a guy who has since put up 63 and 71 point seasons .
and so far this season that guy is on pace for 56 points in 82 games played .
still solid but when you 're a big goal scoring center with 26 and 33 goal outings but let 's look deeper at his numbers this season and in the past .
ryan johansen has 6 goals in 38 games on pace for only 12-13 goals this season .
that 's similar to what he had in his first two seasons as a 19/20 year old .
and now suddenly ryan johansen has slumped back down to the numbers he put up as a new face to this league .
his pdo is exactly 100 http www.hockey-reference.com/players/j/johanry01-additional.html his cf is within his career average a little above in fact but his sh http stats.hockeyanalysis.com/showplayer.php ? pid=1519 is below average .
to be precise his career sh is 9.95 and this season he 's putting up an 8.93 so almost exactly a full percentage below and 3-4 percentage points below where he 's been for the past two years .
and to top that all off ryan johansen is getting more offensive zone starts this year than his past two seasons hockey-reference .
typically we see that players who get more starts in the defensive zone especially centers are the better two-way centers .
bergeron for example has nearly 60 of his draws in the defensive zone and to contrast patrick kane has nearly 6**6 !
those numbers are extremes but ryan johansen is clearly leaning towards a high scoring threat and away from a shutdown center if you look at his draws .
in essence the first 40 games of the season statistically are either a long slump for ryan johansen or his previous two seasons were outliers and this is the ryan johansen that the predators will have for the next two years before he looks for an extension again .
if we want to use the eye test to look for positive and negative indications of how his career can go we have a lot to draw from 300 career games .
whiffing on a puck with an open net from the face off dot whiffing on a faceoff and conceding the fastest response goal in nhl history .
looking for positives we can see his skill in the shootout he can break into the offensive zone and dangle through defenders making them look silly as he heads towards the net .
another thing that has been mentioned on occasion this season is heart troubles .
johansen was hospitalized over the summer http bluejacketsxtra.dispatch.com/content/stories/2015/10/26/1026-jackets-notes.html due to an accelerated heart rate .
is this something that comes into the equation when looking at his on-ice struggles '' this season ?
jarmo said that his non-healthy scratch early in the season was not heart related but what else is the gm going to say ?
he only has 2 more points on the season than nick foligno .
and this is not a jab at the captain and they are both assists .
i could n't find if they 're both primary assists or not hockeyviz has n't included the most recent game yet but they appear to both by primary .
for a man wanting to be seen as a top 10 center in the league he 's not making a very good case having almost the exact same scoring line as a man who has been criticized relentlessly for his production this season and i 've already written one post on my thoughts there .
i personally do n't believe that johansen 's scoring struggles are due to coach tortorella .
his 5v5 toi http hockeyviz.com/img/player/historystrips/1516/cbj/history-1516-cbj-johanry92.png is divided among so many players .
you can say that he got thrown on the fourth line with gregory campbell but is a line with ryan johansen and nick foligno really the fourth ?
that looks more like a second and a half line in my eyes .
a lot of coaches shuffle lines in the league when things are n't working quenneville therrien sullivan mclellan .
the argument could be made that it ruins potential chemistry but it discovers great line chemistry as well that 's why it 's done .
so i do n't think that ryan johansen 's scoring troubles are because lines were being shuffled i think that tortorella was just trying to find line mates that would spark the big center and help him find his touch again .
do n't believe me when i say that i believe tortorella wanted the best for johansen ?
here are some word straight from the coach 's mouth .
but here 's some of what tortorella had to say about his talented center quite honestly i like the kid .
but he is 23 ... years ... old bangs podium pauses between words for emphasis .
there is a ton there with him and we 're going to try to get it out of him.
seth jones is a 4^th overall pick same pick as johansen actually and has been brought up under a great defensive system in nashville learning under one of the league 's best defenseman in shea weber .
his with or without you http hockeyviz.com/img/player/wowy/1516/nsh/wowy-1516-nsh-jonesse94-shots.png chart is far better than anything the blue jackets have on the blueline .
display_count=yes chart shows great puck possession and solid individual offensive production .
his 5v5 shots/60 chart http hockeyviz.com/img/player/historystrips/1516/nsh/history-1516-nsh-jonesse94.png is pretty damn good too and his worst pairings on his spider chart http hockeyviz.com/img/player/spider/1516/nsh/spider-1516-nsh-jonesse94-shots.png are the two with the least amount of minutes .
seth jones is a very good defenseman and will hopefully only get better with age though he is an rfa after this season so he will need to be signed .
if the blue jackets win the lotto they will draft austin matthews and the 1c hole will be filled thusly .
if they 're second they 'll draft a great defensive prospect in chychrun .
going forward potential defensive pairings for the blue jackets are jones-murray/werenski-paliotta/savard-johnson .
or perhaps jones will be with chychrun if he 's drafted or werenski even .
the organization suddenly has a great defensive future from this trade and if werenski pans out as well as his wjc performance suggests the jackets top pairings will be scary and skilled .
offensive prospects now can not be traded away milano rychel and bjorkstrand will all be hoping to fill the offensive gap left by johansen 's departure and it will be a big one .
luckily guys like jenner and wennberg have shown that they can be serviceable top 6/9 centers and for now dubinsky or jenner will be likely be slotted into the hole .
the more i think about this trade the better i feel about .
losing johansen is obviously a blow but the acquisition of jones helps the defensive issues that have been the biggest problem this season .
if korpisalo or forsberg pan out one of them can fill in as a more usable backup to give bob less stress and more rest .
prospects still need to pan out they always do but if they do then stop me if you 've heard this before the future is bright .
a high pick in this draft will only help the team greatly either finish shoring up the defense or almost immediately replacing the offensive gap left by this trade .
i 'm just comparing my players and i 'm not sure what the difference between those two attributes is .

just recently i accidentally received what i am lead to believe malware after my computer detected it .
unsure of where the source of the problem was i ran malware bytes and windows defender and had them scan the computer and get rid of anything that may be wrong .
afterwards the notifications stopped and things went back to normal ... kinda .
everything runs fine for the most part but here 's the problem all media files .png .jpg .mp4 .mp3 .wma .wav etc .
none of my software can open up the image files and opening up songs in winamp show that they are 0 or 1 second long and do n't play any sound whatsoever .
this even went into my dropbox and did the same thing .
at first i thought it was just my computer being unable to open anything but when trying to access pictures and songs on my phone they were all shown as incompatible .
i 'm unsure what to do now the files seemed to have retained their file sizes and programs run fine but all of my old media files simply do n't work the only ones that do are ones that i download now .
i looked into the issue and thought that maybe i had the cryptowall virus but i do n't recall anything popping up about a ransom .
i additionally thought a simple system restore from two days ago would work out but alas it did not .
so right now i really have no idea what to do .
all or any help is greatly appreciated thank you !
seeing that star citizen reached 105 million in funding got me thinking is that really as much as it sounds ?
i read in an article that the game destiny '' had a budget of 500 million which is about 5 times more than the current funding for star citizen .
but destiny '' is an fps game not an mmorpg .
and i do n't have any information about mmorpg budgets .
it would be nice to know the budgets of some popular mmos so i could put star citizen 's 105 million in perspective .
right now i do n't know what to think should i think man 105 million that 's really a lot they sure have more than enough money to do whatever they want with the game ! ''
it 's only a lot if you compare it to other crowdfunded games but if you compare it to normally funded games it 's actually kind of a low budget . ''

the ending scene on the preview for episode 8 should ruby and velvet talking about yang .
coco might have experienced some hallucinations in the arena and told her team .
the team kinda shrugged it off as 'oh it was just your nerves ' or 'the stresses of losing are getting to you . '
but then the yang situation happens ruby tells velvet yang 's side and then velvet tells ruby what coco experienced .
this could lead to in episode 9 ruby confronting emerald about the whole thing .
which would defiantly throw a wrench into whatever cinder is planning as someone is on to them .

a month ago i said i would go to the clinic and admit i 've been hiding from life in bed with a bottle of vodka and oxy everyday instead of going to work and being a functioning adult .
i 've been more or less clean a month now.. so that 's good i guess i say more or less because two weeks ago i went looking for my meds and found some codeine .
i made it into crack morphine and enjoyed that a night p
i guess the next step is to just turn mostly clean '' into clean . ''
i just replaced the addiction with a bunch of others sodas cigarettes compulsive eating video games drinking that make socializing unappealing .
i still go to work but now i just sit around playing mafia returns with my spare time .
i tihnk it 's really hard to match the escapism opiates provide .
the clinic has been really good to me they test me and are n't scathing if they detect drugs .
instead they talk to me about what made me go and do it and how i can curb it in the future .
lots of love to you guys even u/worldofwomen but i seriously hope you get therapy soon.. you really need it and i do n't say that as an insult
this was part of a conversation with my husband this morning .
i know he has been feeling insecure but goddamn .
i 'm about as loyal as they come so this just makes me feel a little insulted .
especially with everything we have dealt with and i have put up with .
ya 'll see who i talk to and what i post .
he has access to my facebook reddit emails and phone .
yes privacy is important in a relationship and he gives that but regardless i 've had enough betrayal and shit go wrong in my life that i 'm all about being an open book .
just remember to put it on airplane mode before you pass it to button .
get up get ready husband button and i get in the car so he can take me to work we have one vehicle since his car ca n't handle the winter .
as we are pulling out of the driveway button is fussing .
i get in the back to see what 's going on and i guess i got a message on facebook .
about a plane crash that occured when i was active duty from someone who is a friend of a high school friend .
nice guy but we 've never met in person and we wo n't either .
he 's also been a friend on facebook since before i met my husband .
so i tell my husband about it because by the way he is asking it 's as if the crash happened today .
i look it up and it was years ago .
we laugh a little about it and then this takes place
me oh he 's friend 's with a girl i went to high school with .
i think he 's a pilot for a major airliner .
at this point i 'm confused as to why there is even a problem .
i should note here that this is when i realized when i got back into the front seat my facebook messenger was open but had that stupid thing up that wants me to turn on notifications .
i 'm not all about my phone buzzing nonstop !
i had thought i hit the button accidentally when i put the phone down but now i think he was attempting to snoop or something .
which i do n't care if he reads my messages but he 's gon na get bored reading them .
me do you have something you want to ask me or something ?
cause at that point i do n't even care .
and to add to the reddit boyfriend thing that is in reference to a few weeks ago .
i 'm friends on facebook with a few others from another sub .
we have a closed facebook page where we talk .
they even sent baby shower gifts cause they are awesome like that .
so one of the people is a guy and he sent me a message i responded .
husband saw and asked what i was doing so i told him .
oh so you are talking to your reddit boyfriend ! '' .
we will be discussing this tonight cause even if he says he is joking '' i know he is n't .
i 've deleted real life friends in the past for him and not in a controlling way .
dude crossed the line and hit on me so i immediately told my husband and deleted him .
but i just do n't get where this sudden jealousy is coming from .
i 'm all about maintaining healthy boundaries and such but i do n't want it start getting into a territory where i 'm having to delete facebook delete reddit and get into isolation territory .
maybe i 'm going doomsday scenario here as i do n't think it would go that far but i 'm not digging what he is insinuating .
we will be talking tonight to avoid this being an issue again .
turns out it was n't jealousy '' but more of a double standard and a lack of trust on my part bothering him .
we will be talking more and this is more of a molehill than a mountain .
he just did n't know how to approach it .
i will be in theory entering next fall to begin my freshman year .
i 'm planning on applying to other schools right now to see if i can find a better financial plan at another school .
should i be approaching this as a transfer student ?
i 'm new to this subreddit and new to the game purchased ttk about a week before xmas and i 'm getting the hang of the game and i believe i 'm learning pretty fast but there are still a few things i really ca n't find answers for .
if there are some resources you guys would suggest or if this is n't the place for this post by all means point me in the right direction or delete this post and pm me please .
if i purchase a legacy engram from xur and it has a year two version if i purchase it from the kiosk will it be the y2 version or still y1 .
i 'm 301 light from running solo stuff and i 'm trying to get as high as i can is this a good place to be before i start raiding or should it be a little higher ?
i really only have a few exotics mida and a few armor pieces is there any other pieces i should get before trying to raid ?
i 'm gon na try and get black spindle and sleeper stimulant asap and i 'm on the last part of the exotic sword quest
this one is probably stupid but should i really go grab the hung jury this week or is everyone just being dank memers by saying that is has great rolls ?
again i 'm really sorry if this is n't the place for this i 'm just extremely excited about destiny and i 'm trying to learn everything i can about this game .
thank you in advance for any help you can provide fellow guardians .
do i still get a trade hold if i dont lose anything in the trade ?
also the dude i am trading with has the mobile authenticator .
i have a question regarding an issue i ran in to while working on the intermediate front end development projects .
i had a problem with the wikipedia reader project where i could not get the json call to work due to some header information user agent missing .
when i added this i noticed another error which was
no 'access-control-allow-origin ' header is present on the requested resource .
i figured out that i could work around this using by specifying the datatype as 'jsonp ' .
this works but i would really like to know why i did not have to do this on the previous projects openweathermap/fcc news .
were n't this also json calls that took place across domains ?
i guess in the case with owp that this had something to do with the fact that a api key was required ?
i have quite a bit experience as developer daily job as iphone developer but networking has always been my weak spot .
can anyone recommend a good resource on this subject ?

what online profiles/presences should a technologist have to help promote themselves ?
so i 'm a fairly new to i hosted a tournament for about 30 people about 3 months ago .
the tournament was a success we had prizes and everything .
so the only thing i failed on was the amount of wiiu set-ups .
we only had one set-up hooked up to a monitor and a large projector and that 's it .
this made the tournament last way to long and there were people who sat around for a very long time in between matches .
i am hosting my second tournament in about a month so i 'd like to ask fellow to 's how many wiiu set-ups is best ?
i am expecting about 50 people to attend this tournament .
so my theory is that we have 4 matches running at once on separate monitors .
then once we reach the semi 's for singles/doubles we start doing 1 match at a time while hooked up to a large projector .
does my current plan sound alright for 50 people ?
my only worry is that it would be hard for people to watch other matches due to the fact that they would have to stand behind the players and just look at the monitor .
would it be a bad idea to just get a rotation of matches going on the projector ?
by that i mean singles winners singles loosers doubles winners doubles loosers .
we only have 1 projector so we would just move the plug from station to station like a rotation so there would always be a match on the projector to watch .
i 'm fully expecting many downvotes as this is n't a popular opinion but felt it was right to share regardless .

i specifically looked at hepatitis b as in the usa hospitals give that routinely at birth and was horrified to see how in trials it sometimes caused death among various other diseases they even link it to sids directly .

i 've been wrestling with this problem for a while and it 's becoming more than just an inconvenience .
we block downloading windows cab files on our firewall but we open various ms sites as exceptions .
lately however all updates are being blocked because the ips are n't resolving to ms site names .
the firewall error displayed on the pc says the site was download.microsoft.com so it should n't have been blocked .
but the firewall blocked 172.226.77.12 which resolves as a172-226-77-12.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com .
i 've also seen these ips resolve to cache.google.com .
is anyone else having this problem and how did you resolve it ?
how dangerous are windows cab files and do i really need to block them ?
ps this same problem is blocking users from downloading ms office templates from ms online .
that 's been a nuisance problem for a while now too .

if before a winner is chosen and a mod messages me a recommendation to someone who has contributed to this community in the past and lost their account i will defer to their judgement .
i should have almost all of the characters since day one all 50 with a few exceptions to new characters .
character specific relics dark sword sentinel 's grimoire lightning steel diamond pin lulu 's hairpin and wild bear .
still have n't picked the beginners choice i hear stormlance might work well with the lighting steel

a skills group literally just discusses the set of skills presented that week .
in my experience it 's more like a lecture class with the facilitator going over the ideas group members do n't have much opportunity to speak of their experiences .
a process group allows the members to discuss how they 've applied those skills to their lives that week to process the information they 've learned in the skills group perhaps to process the feelings that come up ?
i 've never been able to go to a dbt process group .
i 've done non-dbt process groups but sometimes they 're a shitshow if the facilitator lacks the ability to direct group members to stay on topic and allow everyone to have time to talk .

even if people think your articles are clickbaity or sensationalist it was amusing how much cursing the name tyler rogaway was going on in this sub lol .
hmm that 's odd.. can you post a photo of that ?
just fyi i have tutored on and off for the past 7 years .
i would not tutor for you if those are the terms of employment .
anyone who has any sort of experience in this field has worked for numerous companies so telling someone that they ca n't work for anyone else for three years would definitely rub me the wrong way .
most tutors do this job for side income for a semester here a semester there .
also if you are hiring an independent contractor it basically means they are their own business owner meaning they are basically selling their services to you .
i 'm pretty sure it is illegal to require an independent contractor to sign a non compete for this very reason .
the mudslides start after about two weeks of regular rain .
looks like there are only a few days of rain forecast for the next 10 days so hopefully the ground has time to recover .
those cops in your video probably knew the guy .
i 'm pretty sure being a cop is n't in the top 10 dangerous jobs in the us .
for your information we do n't call them asses '' where i 'm from .
an armor with can store and use a lot of energy and i mean a lot of it but which consumes it quite quickly .
stronger than draconium maybe but really complicated to craft .
once it 's crafted you will need a multiblock structure to wear it and take it off except if its storage goes to 0 in which case it will get unequipped and possibly fall on the ground .
although stronger than draconium it uses power for everything .
from a walking speed boost to flying at max speed to withstanding a chaos dragon in the face .
perhaps they 're just setting off large amounts of traditional explosives to try and fool us into thinking they 're doing nuclear tests .
like the guy who is regularly diddled by his roommate against his will ?
i do n't think it defines them as a whole at all nor do i think playful snowball fights define them as a whole .
if you 're looking for some honest critique from a fellow artist to help her improve then i 'm happy to help .
though if what you said in your follow up comment about her never seeing this is true then this is somewhat of a pointless endeavor p .
being off center as they go down the face .
of the face is wider than the left even factoring in the optical illusion created by the left side being covered by hair .
the neck is too long and is anatomically incorrect with its placement into the bottom of the skull specifically the left side connecting just to the left of the chin .
the head it self should be shuffled to the right so the chin is more centered on the neck and the left side of the neck is closer to the left side of the skull .
the inside of the right eye again from the viewers perspective .
the bottom eyelid is nearly flat at the tear duct and slopes upward as it gets farther away .
in this case the inner tear duct section has more curve to it than the upper lid which does n't make anatomical sense even factoring in the stylization of the drawing. .
this http tentopet.livejournal.com/34995.html is an excellent tutorial on learning the proper anatomy of eyes and how they should act '' so to speak when drawn at any angle .
the right eye is also set much higher on the skull than the left .
this is the leading factor in making the face look stretched out as it does .
the shoulder even factoring in the slightly turned pose .
is much to close to the neck and does n't seem to take into account the trapezius muscle .
i would draw up some sketches to show what i mean by some of these things but the cable for my tablet crapped out on me the other day and i ca n't get a new one until the weekend .
once i do though i 'll edit this post with some drawings to show what i mean .
one positive thing i feel i have to mention is the shading is very well done .
i have really been wanting to do some recording myself but it would be neat to be able to edit something the mods put out .
at my current position at school i manage my university 's youtube page and would have some fun editing rust videos for a change instead of editing intro to theater videos which are actually pretty funny .
you 're just another option to him while he 's your priority does n't seem fair at all .

you basically get money or nordy notes as a reward for spending money !
you do need to be a nordstrom cardholder but the rewards apply to both credit and debit cardholders .
i also love that both stores offer designated days to earn extra 2x 3x etc .
at nordy you can choose your extra point days so when you know you 're going to make a large purchase you can earn rewards really fast !
i love stories like this in which a person 's edc comes in to save the day !

ah thanks for pointing that out i 've read it on so many places that i assumed it was correct .
what than is the reason for having significant lower fps in mp games ?
i am not even remotely an expert on this but instinctively i think multiplayer would increase the fps because the server can offload a lot of things from the clients .
that said i hardly ever notice that i have low fps in multiplayer sometimes it goes down to 30 but i 'm not complaining .
even if people tell me i have terrible self-esteem and i generally brush it off .
i feel like i ca n't see what others see about me .
i 've been told i 'm beautiful ... but how does one go about agreeing with that when they ca n't see it themselves ?
pod is a suspect taken into custody pending trial while brienne is allowed to represent them and gather evidence for their case .
the corruption and systematic failings of the ruling and lawful institutions does not equate to the bwb being legitimate .
in asoiaf the lawful institutions ' rulings are automatically legitimate .
aerys sentencing rickard and brandon was legitimate since he was the king .
robb sentencing rickard karstark was legitimate since he was the king .
ned sentencing gared was legitimate because he was the lord paramount acting in the name of the king .
like it or not but lady stoneheart is the lawful institution here .
she is the highest ranking member of her faction acting in the name of her son and king robb .
as such she has the right to put anybody on trial .
the other people of her faction that are lawful institutions next to her the blackfish and edmure would not have bothered with a trial for brienne and pod in the first place they would 've hanged them already .
if you 're going by our standards you have to admit that none of the rulings in this series have ever been legitimate not even ned 's .
do you think a suspect that has to procure evidence of their innocence or else face the law is being blackmailed ?
so you agree it 's because of the allegiances he was born into
... is n't everything in this series because of the allegiances the people were born into ?
it must be horrible to read this series and not be able to let go of 21st century western morality .

you guys wanted to bench maclin at one point ?
i had a game where are guy was obviously wall hacking .
when checking his account between rounds he had 7 previous vac bans on his account .
i did n't understand how he was still able to be playing the game .
something very similar has actually been said to my face when i was a teenager growing up in a small community .
and then when i got my first job and i casually told my boss that i listened to metal at the time he 'd always try to make fun of me for being that satanist '' which not-so-plot-twist i was not .
when he did that in front of some customers though i seriously had to try to keep my cool as hard as i could .

the problem is that a resource-based economy typically implies one based on population data gathering and scientific management '' .

normally functioning kidneys can process about 800-1000 ml 0.2-0.26 gallons per hour .
you are approaching that limit with a 0.19 gal/hr consumption rate assuming your kidneys are normal .
that 's a little close for my comfort without having any medical data to confirm that i was 'normal ' given how poorly i 've treated my body for decades .

i was apparently up too late and thought i had said lighter coarser '' after re reading i was right the first time .
i 'm going to delete my erroneous response to avoid confusion .
it 's perfectly alright to vent out this sub is about discussing the game and that includes both victory or defeat .
discipline and self-control are both learned through experience and sometimes we have to learn the hard way .
your not limited to only one option of quiting cold-turkey .
maybe set aside a budget for the game and be strict in not spending 1 more and just wait until you build the budget back up .
these games are specifically designed to tempt your wallet and you just have to prepare yourself to say no ! ''
that is you know immediately whether you did a good job or not .
some guys like it for the above reasons because they are burnt-out from something else and want a less-challenging job that still bring home a check .

15k armour at 5k life makes you able to survive a 6207 phys hit .
lightning coil with 75 lightning res makes you survive a 6451 hit armour from lightning coil ignored .
30k armour with 5k life makes you survive 7108 phys hits .
i know 15 k armour is an investment but getting 1207 life is also a big investment and 15 k armour helps even more against a burst of say 5 rapid hits .
surely you specifically are able to move your head without involving your shoulders .
in my experience 9/10 people have no hip awareness .
i saw the hit while watching the game was staggered it was n't a penalty .
but i my immediate thought was that 's going to cost him a game .
i think its the lesser-known player injury no-call adding up to a bonus game .
the no-call thing isnt his fault yet it seems to justify adding another day sometimes .
good call on the fly speed/not a power gamer train of though .
i was thinking fly speed is way too powerful for a racial trait but like you said she 's in it for the rp not to power game so it 'll likely be fine .

the biggest problem imho is the psi set does n't take an adapter .
so now you need a 5/8 '' smooth to 1x8 adapter instead of an insert .
the insert in the nova g3 should have far less runout .
also small detail but with the g3 kit you 'll get cole jaws which would be helpful if you get into bowl turning vs. the 3 bowl jaws in the psi kit .
the dovetail tenon you 'd need to turn to fit those would jaws would match a bowl larger that is pushing the limits of what would fit on your smith .
who gives a fucking fuck what fucking sports team some fucking company claims gets paid to like ?

i like to submit exhibit a for the court my toilet bowl after i eat at chipotle .
that 's one of the badass things about tfa the mythos of luke skywalker .
it is so cool to see that the bad guys fear him so much .
it creates an interesting dynamic since the emperor was so arrogant that he did n't fear what jedi remained and was easily convinced to make luke his new apprentice instead of killing him right away .
to see snoke more cautious makes him seem much harder to defeat .
it 's a little ridiculous to say you should probably give up on trying to climb after playing less than 20 games if you 've already given up then perhaps ranked just is n't for you .
silver 3 is n't that bad definitely not awful but you need way more games to accurately judge your rank .
you 'll need 50 games minimum to get a semi-accurate rating and even that is n't really enough .
do n't be discouraged if you drop rank after season 6 placements either plenty of new players end up in the silver 2-5 range after getting kind of lucky in placements then drop to a bronze level after playing more .
if you really want to climb just keep practicing you 're probably going to need several hundred games before you start noticing significant progress and make it to gold or higher .

i have to admit in rewatching ds9 i skip all the mirror episodes .
they feel like such dull plotting and they demand such as you noted unsubtle performances .
the reason episodes focussing on garak tended to do so well for me was because your performances and the scripts they sent you elevated the characterisation above what is expected from genre fiction on tv .
honestly watching garak felt more like watching a really good play than a scifi show .

you clearly have a major objection to some part of it .

if you switched more than likely you would either do 70 unlimited .
so roughly 130 before anything just plan were as eds1500 is 150 for two lines that are smartphones .
since you have no discount we do n't have to worry about that .
now your other option is the 40 gb family share i would say the 10 but your usage is fairly high .
so the 40gb plan is 120 line access at 15 if on ib lease or no contract or 40 if you entered a contract after 8/22/14 .
so just assuming that both lines do n't have contracts you base plan is 150 no savings there and you would give up truly unlimited data .
i 'm so sorry for what you 're going through .

to be fair as good as the 2014 team was they should n't have had much of a chance against seattle and actually played a pretty damn good game .
seattle kind of imploded on themselves a bit but they said the same things about that game and actually did it for 55 minutes .
that being said this is n't the same team but they 've played very inconsistently on offense and even defense year long there 's no reason they could n't have 2 good performances on a single day despite the problems that everyone is aware of that wo n't be going away .
execution has still been a big part of it .
i agree with all that but this is not an emotional panic reaction this is an inherent problem in the system that began with the sale ban on 5 shareholders which was about to be lifted and inflated numbers on top of a million other global happenings .
bringing up their name on the in-match scoreboard and selecting it will bring up a menu where reporting is an option .

the best you can get as a average german citizen is the waffenbesitzkarte '' which allows you to own and fire in the range a weapon up to a specified caliber .
but only if you have means of properly storing it i.e .
a safe or in case of my family the reinforced storage in the shooting club .
if i recall correctly you need to specify a reason for owning a weapon like being a hunter for example too .
trivia you need some other permit to be allowed to buy ammunition and own .

i grind daily with a skerton and i recently bought my girlfriend the mini-mill .
overall i would say that the mini mill has a slight advantage in the coarser end of the spectrum but only marginally .
with that being said my chemex settings are generally medium to medium-coarse and are generally pretty consistent for a chemex brew .
honestly your chemex technique will be the limiting factor for a while and you wo n't really feel that the skerton is holding you back .
i 've made some pretty great coffee with the skerton and i do not hesitate to recommend it to others .
the mini mill is great too and would easily fit the bill although larger brews may require re-filling the hopper .

i once was on a class trip to la and while we were on the trip we got to visit hollywood blvd and all of the gift shops right around the kodak theater .
being in 7th grade i decided that the giant grenade necklace similar to this one here https s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/08/b6/7c/08b67ca5714fcbc213342a57696cc9fc.jpg would be the perfect souvenir to help remember the trip by .
not long after i purchased it the pendant broke off from the chain and i could not find it despite tearing through all of my things .
sure enough 5 days later as i am checking my backpack through the x-ray scanner at lax the tsa security scanned my backpack and immediately pulled my 7th grade self aside and said sir our scan indicates that you have a grenade in your backpack and we will need to take this bag in order to do further scans right now but in the meantime you need to tell us exactly what is in that bag right now . ''
it was at this point in my life that i first ever remember being truly angry with myself because i realized that my stupidity which came from buying that necklace in the first place had led me to being held and questioned by airport security who took it as a real threat .
after i repeatedly explained to them what it was and the explosives sensors picked up nothing they searched through my bag and ultimately found the pendant in some random pocket that it had fallen into .
i was ultimately able to rejoin my class who had been standing just passed the end of security on the other side for probably 20-30 minutes but not before i was given a strong talking to by the agent tasked with searching through all of my stuff .
single handedly one of the scariest and most embarrassing moments of my childhood .
tl dr i once bought a grenade shaped necklace and lost it but the tsa at lax found it while i was going through security and held me for a while until they could clear me of any possible threat .

no the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface .
it is true that there will be a horizontal and vertical component to the normal force however if its vector is pointing directly at the object 's center of mass there will be no net torque .
if however the vector does not point at the center of mass an instance where a sphere would have a center at mass not at its geometric center it will rotate .

building your stuff for various platforms is pretty difficult .
and it gets worse the more libraries you depend on .
other more modern languages like java for instance you can simply specify the artifact you want it 'll automatically pull it in and you can depend on it immediately and run a single task to build it for every desktop platform and similar for mobile platforms .
you 'd think by now c being as popular as it is they would 've created a sort of library package management and good build system..
gradle can supposedly do it recently but it 's support is n't that exceptional for that .
also there are a lot of mechanisms that really show its age .
clang was trying to fix that with modules somewhat but who knows how long that 'll take and where it will go .
and yeah the std lib completely pales in comparison to many other languages out there .
yes yes you could do the age old argument but it 's just a library like any other '' except it really is n't .
and it really shows given literally every library creates their own string class to overcome its issues .
other languages also have really elaborate threading network http xml handling built right in .
and with c if you do n't like it.. again you go back to dependency hell .
so it is n't as simple as use a library '' .
i guess it is the kind of crowd it attracts that results in a lot of stagnation in build systems .
that said to op do n't concern yourself with what other people think so much .
worst case if you 're sick of the complexity or run into so many issues you 'll come out of it knowing way more than someone who has never used c .

4 if you think neither of these situations are censorship and your main stance on gg 's censorship '' cries is you have a right to be upset by this but stop calling it censorship '' then can we please at least agree that the issue here is of different understandings of what censorship '' actually is
i 've mainly been against the use of the term censorship '' because it 's so dramatic at its core meaning but applied so widely and vaguely that there 's no rhyme or reason to it but you still retain the dramatic threatening meaning .
i do n't think this is censorship by any meaningful definition of the word just as doax was n't either .
i 've always been mostly concerned with the content i.e .
what 's actually done why and what effects it has .
labeling steven universe as well as doax as censorship can be logically consistent sure as far as labeling goes .
looking at the issues themselves i 'm not convinced they 're all that similar or that i have to be against both if i 'm against one .
just because i support an ad where a company shows a positive portrayal of gay people does n't mean i have to hold back expressions of criticism and censorship by gg definitions of a company 's ad that portrays gays negatively .
both are free speech issues and both could be labeled censorship if the ads are pulled because of protests but it really hides the deeper issues .
and not of some mythical overwhelming gg desire to see as many anime tits in an hour as humanly possible ?
your exaggerated joke aside anime boobs are often defended with some shamed male sexuality argument .
it seems like it partly is an argument from desire .
not that there 's anything fundamentally wrong with that i 'm just saying .
it 's not sexual desire that 's criticized anyway when we criticize these things .

obama appeared to be a refreshing social democrat when compared to bush and ultimately is probably preferable to the alternatives and since most europeans like americans see elections and government as the apex of politics and are generally not as left-wing as americans seem to think it makes sense that they would like '' obama .
some europeans do n't like him any more than any other us president though he is fundamentally just another center-right politician masquerading as a centre-left politician which would n't be much better .
all that being said i do n't know why you think the majority '' like him .
i 'm sure you 've done plenty of research on the governance of the us but you should probably do research on more widespread ideas in politics .
politics is n't just voting and what the people who are voted in do '' .
you might already know this but politics '' extends into everything more or less .
do n't think that politics has nothing to do with economics and do n't think that economics stops at markets '' .
it 's important to understand your own ideological basis why do you believe the things you believe ?
and why things are n't always as simple as they seem on the surface especially when you make assumptions automatically about the nature of the world because of that ideological basis .
i bring this up because many people myself included would object to your claim that some people just want to start trouble '' when they do n't listen '' to a cop .
why do you assume that police officers are there to help and not to say ensure you stay scared intimidated ?
perhaps more importantly why do feel compelled to explain away police killings just because the victims should have known to do what they 're told ?
have you thought that maybe a lot of these people are so afraid of cops that they think their better option would be to not do what they 're told ?

one example is when the characters are in the book world the main character confuses their friends and enemies by talking back and forth and fforde does n't put ..says character '' after each line of dialogue
then after a few sentences the characters forget who it is that 's actually talking saying something like wait which one am i in this ? ''
because there has been so much unattributed dialogue and the reader you then realises oh yeah i do n't know who actually know who you are now either '' so everyone just kinda walks away

they wo n't stay the same the eu always introduces a new major treaty average every 9-10 years .
the next one is designed to split the eu into
ie there will be 2-tiers in the eu parliament ez inner core and outer non-ez ring .
the problem is the date/timing of the referendum 2017 .
it 's designed to get the british out of the way to prevent a veto of the next major treaty by us .
there 's no reason why we should hold a referendum out of sync with what the eu is doing .
in the eu the eu is the main show .
this is demonstrated by logic of available options in the eu for reform vs available options outside the eu for uk reform .

we know that you cant reconnect is because of the game creating the replay or something like this .
so you have to rebuild the game if you reconnect longer the game time longer to rebuild my thought about this was to have the server make real time savepoint and building the replay then send the replay to each player after game end so anyone could just come back immediately just building most needed data
take a look at the resources provided in the sidebar including the buildapc beginners guide and search the subreddit for similar builds to what you 're looking for and use that as jumping off point .

brutal legend was alright but it was the development and the management issues that get brought up .
which goes to the whole arguments of df being spotty on how they handle the administrative end .
as for space base you are missing the point .
the point is n't that it 's early access and the risks it 's how df presented those risks to the consumer .
it was leveled as df putting it 's backing to the game and downplaying the fact that they were only funding the game through early access .
like i bought into it for the reason that it was presented as a game df committed to putting out .
and let 's be honest df putting a project up means more than an upstart small garage project and when they handled it like one people got pissed .
it tarnished their reputation with how they handled it .
and it should because that was entirely fucked up .

claims that unet will be able to handle big scale mmorpg .
however unet is still being implemented so i do n't know if it 's exactly true in it 's current state but it should be from what i understand based on what u .
2 the way i would do it is have a single project and use preprocessor directives to make sure that the parts of code unique to server side ends up in server build only .
also quick search shows that you apparently can now do that from code as well maybe http docs.unity3d.com/scriptreference/playersettings.setscriptingdefinesymbolsforgroup.html
3 at this stage of unet development my understanding is that your only option is to run an instance of unity built as your authoritative server that has the server side logic preprocessor or separate projects for client and server sides .
you can run it with batchmode http docs.unity3d.com/manual/commandlinearguments.html option for headless instance for better performance .
note that running an instance of unity even headless as your server is not the best choice performance wise .
you should do some testing to see if it can handle the amount of computation you expect from it .
edit for more performance you should n't use unity engine on server side at all .
instead you should replicate the relevant logic using lower level apis like physx for physics etc .
even better implement everything your self from scratch to make sure that server is running only the logic actually required for gameplay .

know the characters strenghs and weaknesses i recommend http www.gamefaqs.com/n64/197860-mario-kart-64/faqs/27391
make sure you use all the allowed shortcuts koopa troopa beach yoshi 's valley etc .
for example drop your banana items only on bridges or narrow corridors or surprise your enemies by back-firing a green shell look on the others screen beforehand to know when you hit them .
also keep in mind that being first place in 1st or 2nd round does not always ensure a victory .
fight until the last second many matches are decided in the second half of last round .
they provide excellend safety as a shield and can be very effective when used correctly hitting an enemy in front of a curve in order to shoot him off the road backfireing .
if you drew the lighting as an item use them when enemies approach a jump wario stadium/dk jungle when someone other than you gets it watch out when they might use it i used to lower my speed when i thought it was about to hit me when i approached a bigger jump .
know the location of item boxes so you dont run into the fake ones also look out for bananas !
tip sometimes when running over a banana your character keeps on driving but starts to struggle get off the gas now !
if you pay attention to this you should be fine .

it 's coming from california and i 'm assuming you do n't live in the us .
i just shipped a bunch of packages to virginia from california the cost per package varied from 30 to 70 .
the lightest one was close to the weight that i assume the rift will be and the price is about the same .
companies like amazon can offer low prices for shipping because they have long term relationships with shipping companies .
if you doubt it go on ups ' website and get a quote on a similar sized package .
let 's say it costs them 350 to make it would it make sense to raise the price and potentially lose customers for a short term profit ?
they stand to make way more money on software games and movies so why risk losing potential customers ?
microsoft never made a profit on the original xbox .
in fact they lost a ton of money on them but they made it back on the games .
the xbox 360 made a profit towards the end of its life but it was originally sold at a loss .
i get people are upset about the price but there nothing malicious going on here .

eh maybe in 12-24 months not worth the money yet
setting up your own private wormhole to bear in is quite good
how do you bear solo without constantly being harassed by passing gangs trying to kill you ?
do you actually constantly roll all entrences and have an eye out for every hole that opens up in your system ?
it will open at whatever price its going for in after hours/premarket .
for instance aapl closed at 4pm at around 100.50 and is trading at 97.50 right now .
if the market were opening right now it would open at 97.50 ... but with the sudden influx of volume at the open it can swing it wildly within the first 45 seconds or few minutes of the open .
lets say everyone looks at the premarket price of 97 and thinks wow bargain '' and then decide to put in buy orders for the open .
the stock can jump from 97.50 to 98 or 98.50 almost instantly and same goes vice-versa if people want to dump shares when it opens .
so you shouldnt always put too much stock in after hours prices unless some major news has broken earning reports manufactorer news ceo change etc .
but for normal trading it wont make or break for the most part .
but in summary yes it opens at the premarket price .
yeah if she 's honest many would benefit from it i suppose .
i would probably turn her down ironically but then again she probably would n't approach me with that offer either .
last time they did this they decided to lob shells back and forth .
i hope all the rok and us soldiers stay safe and ready .
hi guys one thing i 've had in mind for quite a while is a four-way collab tackling the criminal mastermind challenge on gta online 's heists .
ideally looking for people gmt a couple of hours for easier scheduling and over 20s purely because nobody likes squeakers .
i 'm not going to ask for only people with multiple thousands of subs to respond because i 'm not shitty .
i 'm all for helping channels smaller than my own as well but if there 's someone who could bring in a nice chunk of audience for the whole group that would be fantastic all round .
i 'm currently creeping up on 200 subs myself and really trying to create a few series that people are going to enjoy this year and a four-person group tackling heists succeeding or cocking things up could be a good draw for everyone .
my channel is here if you want a nosey https www.youtube.com/user/robcoxxy
i 'm on pc and based in the uk .
ideally i 'm looking for a group that gets along well has a good rapport and ideally wants that sweet multi-million payout in the criminal mastermind challenge .
my usual gta group plays a tonne of deathmatches races and things as well so there 's room for even more content if you join in those sessions as well .
who knows this could be the start of a few collab series between us or just some new gaming buddies !
i work in a budget motel and we 've been having a lot of trouble with long term guests lately .
first we started enforcing a 28 day cap after staying with us for 28 days they must check out and be off property for at least 24 hours before they can check back in .
that helped a bit but many of the long term people are just generally annoying to have here .
plus management also was having to frequently chase them down for payment of the room .
rent would be due by noon and they 'd wander in at 4 with the money .
but then the agm had an idea for a new policy .
you have to check out for 24 hours before you can check back in .
no more oh well my sister is bringing me money at 2 ... . '' every damn day .
either it keeps them paying on time or they leave and usually do n't come back .
solo queuing at hotness bronze in ranked and got teamed with a cp celeste who built a blazing salvo ?
probably on its way to becoming an alternating current but unacceptable still !
needless to say ms. blazing salvo got zero kills and a plethora of deaths .

ign is the same as my username if you guys wan na party up in ranked .
i get that royal mail are busy over the christmas period but that does n't mean they can make mistakes and expect get away with it .
i ordered a christmas present for a friend in late november from amazon being delivered via royal mail .
i get a date of december 16th for delivery .
i contact the supplier on the 23rd and do n't get a response until after christmas .
through their tracking information they tell me the package was attempted for deliver taken back to depot and because nobody came to pick it up it was sent back to them .
i never received a card telling me this had been taken back to the depot or i would have gone and got it there were many others which i went to collect .
the supplier has told me they 'd resend out the order i 'd just have to pay for postage and packaging which is really decent of them .
but when i complained to the royal mail they could only offer me an 'apology ' .
they messed up and it 's taken money out of my pocket to rectify it .
not only that i feel really bad for my friend who 's had to go without a christmas present throughout the entire thing .
what should be price of this as i did n't saw much st vulcan with 4 crowns up for trade
i am so mentally exhausted from school and work and people .
i just want time to completely and 100 work on myself .
i want for once in my life to just stop caring what people think .
i want for once in my life to stop having to depend on how i affect others .
i have n't entirely planned it out yet but it needs to be somewhere in the western states .
i am thinking i am going to go to ketchum idaho .
i live in utah so it will be about 6 hours away .
it is where ernest hemingway died and it 's supposed to be very beautiful and small .
i think it would be the perfect place to just relax with a summer job live ... somewhere and read and write for the entire summer .
but if i am going to start planning i need to do it now and start saving up .
now i bet you 're wondering why i am not going to tell anyone .
i am only 18 and i still depend on my parents a lot .
i 'm not trying to be dramatic ... really .
so i started a new papal states ironman and i 'm getting some fishy stuff happening .
i got france austria and switzerland as allies and upped their relations to 180 each .
as soon as i joined the empire i sniped provence and draguignan from provence .
now france did n't seem to mind this right away .
they did n't get any relations penalties after i took the province .
in the end they still had 170 relations but they broke the alliance anyways .
i thought it was odd but it could be that i was rivaled to their ally savoy .
next switzerland is sitting at 180 relations when the swiss guard event fires .
would n't you know for no reason whatsoever the swiss backstab me and deny me my 10 manpower .
i 'm sitting here as her only friend in the world ready to win back her cores from the savoyards and she goes and does this .
i really wonder how the ai chooses what to do with regards to that event .
next i gobble up florence in a small excommunication war and feed arezzo to urbino .
i had claims on firenze and pisa and urbino had one on arezzo .
again the ai screws me over and decides to release florence from arezzo !
my own vassal handed over territory it was in the process of coring !
i 'm pretty sure this last one was because urbino got an unlawful territory request from austria .
but if that 's the case the worst part is that i 'm allied to austria with 150 relations .
plus urbino is my subject they should n't just be handing over my territory .
most of the stuff i 've done is easily reproducible .
have the capacity to care for another outside of marriage .
i can be funny sarcastic stereotypical caring and understanding .
would love to know you more your thoughts and just about anything that comes to mind .
i 'd like to know your day to day and i can tell you mine .
anything can be shared and locked in within me secret wants and maybe even things you have done or want done in your life .
hope this grabs you and we can get talking take care
time to jump on the i uninstalled unsubbed came back bandwagon
i need to do a thin layer chromatography of some natural extract isatis tinctoria meoh extract .
i choose a silica gel stationary phase but my problem is about the mobile phase .
probably i need to use something like chcl3 meoh h2o or something similar .
because the empiric way of multiple trying is too long and material expensive !
better shoot them out of the air before they land because if they sink the boats america sucks .
machine gun turrets rip through the enemies but too many slip through !
we all get some rootbeer floats after it 's over .
i connected it to my terminal mix 2 through the left balanced output of the mixer and set serato to mono .
but still i get some low hum when running the setup without music playing .
i do n't think that there is sth wrong with the way i set up so are the speakers shitty or did i oversee sth ?
not really a topic suggestion or anything just remember there was an episode about this and thought it was a nice follow up for what it 's worth .
... for thinking that i might get away with waiting for the winds of winter before watching s6 of game of thrones and not getting spoiled in the process ?
at the moment everyone on this sub seem to be planning to watch season 6 when it airs in april and are all arguing about how bad the spoilers will be .
am i crazy to think that i might get away with it by staying under the game of thrones-radar ?
to explain it better i have been riding almost since 6 years now and changed two motorcycles so far of completely different make and model .
there have been days when i start my motorcycle i feel like its in full on mood and it runs so smooth with very good performance .
however in some days the motorcycle just wo n't feel like smooth ride but a groggy .
like engine would just revv but wo n't go smooth even at the normal speed .
the mood will change within some days suddenly without any service or changes .
i am not even sure if it is just my feeling or my motorcycle actually does it .
not specifying my motorcycle names as i am sure it has nothing to do with the manufacturer .
just one thing i noticed during these two time periods is that whenever during the 'good ' period when i release accelerator the speed wo n't suddenly reduce however during 'bad ' period soon as i leave the accelerator speed abruptly reduce giving jerking sensation .
sorry for bad presentation of my problem english is not my first language .
this is a stream of consciousness story that happened about a week ago but i thought that it 'd be more fun to tell it in present tense .
her thighs flex and squeeze my ears muffling her ecstasy .
i have to hold my breath during this but i do n't mind .
she has powerful dancer 's legs though ... and those can hurt sometimes ... and she knows it ... but she 's being extra nice tonight .
i survey my goddess from my kneeling vantage point .
she 's collapsed on the bed her breathing deep but returning to normal .
her legs are in the amazing wide split she 's capable of .
her right leg bent at the knee dangles from the bed .
her pussy just inches from my face gleams ... but not in that gross sloppy way that porns intentionally play up ... just a beautiful sheen .
i love the smell of her it 's like vanilla and musk .
a beautiful trimmed dark patch just above her clit .
when we first started dating back in our early twenties she was totally shaved .
i like more hair she likes being the boss .
who ever heard of a mistress with a shaved pussy ?
it felt like a while but it was probably only just seconds .
now more stern and deliberate but without lifting her head from her pillow to look at me put your face back into my pussy.
this is n't an invitation to continue pleasing her .
she wants my face to smell like her orgasm .
naked kneeling with my hands cuffed behind my back and my breathing muffled between lips i 'm not allowed to kiss i have no thoughts of mutiny ... only service and my potential reward .
i hope that she does n't decide to take a nap .
who do you guys think is the best saber servant so far in your experiences in this game ?
unsure of whether i will do 20 or not so it makes sense to opt into the new plan .
will i be back paid the match to the tsp in 2018 for the two years of prior service ?
in response to the complaint thread posted earlier i 'd like to open up this for some feedback .
if you dislike something we 're doing let us know .
if you like something we 're doing let us know .
if you 'd like something different let us know .
if you 're going to be sarcastic at least post how you really feel as well .
edit2 im seeing very little feedback compared to the 75 post saying were terrible moderators .

so i 've always heard that pcs are for engineers .
i 'm preferential towards laptops and most pc laptops are garbage after four years .
i 've seen macbooks last upwards of seven years .
i 'm in my last semester of college towards a bs me and i 'm looking to get a new laptop after i graduate .
i 'm leaning towards a macbook because of their longevity .
granted i most likely wo n't be doing engineering work on my personal home computer in the future but out of curiosity i wonder if macs are suitable for engineering .
are most common engineering programs compatible with mac os ?
i 've seen her touch her ear or cheek to engage communications with people calling her .

among the items are a new fuel door interior driver 's door pull handle tailgate handle and right side tailgate latch .
i can get some items via amazon but i 'd rather not directly support them unless i have to .
i believe it is time that we completely dismantle islam as a doctrine .
we need to remove the power that it has over a significant population of the world .
in light of the recent sexual assaults in europe one has to understand where all of this is coming from .
and i believe the reason is very simple because i 've heard it time and time again from the mouths of some rather uncomfortably orthodox muslims .
the western world as it is now is basically what the islamic heaven looks like .
there are hadiths which talk about the beauty of the white skinned women that muslim men will be rewarded with in jannah .
all of it most people can have right now in the western countries .
but in the muslim countries the situation is in stark contrast .
abject poverty and helplessness are a part of everyday life .
life is not about thriving it 's about surviving .
there is sexual repression to the extent that boys and girls are made to feel guilty to even look at each other .
this causes a massive and this is probably an understatement cognitive dissonance in the brain .
people do n't realize how powerful sexual repression can be .
it 's one of the two most basic needs all humans have and to have it stripped away can get you seriously fucked up .
so you have the arab people raised in these conditions and then you basically take them from what is literally the worst place to grow up to the places that closely resemble their heaven .
they 've always thought about playing out their sexual fantasies in heaven and now that they 're there it 's their time to shine .
on top of this they have no social skills no cultural acuity no idea as to what they 're doing .
the situation is probably only going to get worse before it gets better .
now we exmuslims are at a unique vantage point .
we know what it 's like to be sexually repressed .
we know to what extent islam can mess you up internally .
we are the only ones who have grown up with islamic ideals understood them lived them then discarded them and adopted ideals which were more western and progressive .
we are the only ones who can bridge the gap between the western world which is going to be very angry and in search of vengeance and the muslims .
we can do nothing about the extremists atleast not directly .
but i believe that we can make significant progress with the moderate muslims and get them to see why islam is not the perfect religion .
we need to plant the idea in people 's head that they can leave islam and be happy like we are trying to do .
we need to show them that the world needs to be bigger than islam and that it can only remain a cultural artifact but not a lifelong doctrine .
i do n't know exactly how we are going to do this .
but all i know is that we have to try .
because sooner and later we are going to get involved .
i deranked from le to mg1 and for some reason the games feel even more difficult ...
i do n't want to say that i lost motivation because of my rank but it feels that way .
we are stuck in wildfire right now because our management software cant run creo .
we are looking to upgrade to a true plm system so we can upgrade to creo and improve or life cycle management .
people ask me all the time geeeooorge what do i do with all these great ideas i have for new products ? ''
i tell them call my friends at invent help !
even rioters now think that rengar is 'embarassing ' to exist currently when ironically rengar 's probably in one of the most balanced states he 's seen even in solo q pre-rework rengar was far more broken as a bruiser/tank/mage as well as an assassin .
most people cry that rengar is broken in the disorganized chaos of solo q whilst ignoring that master yi far outstrips rengar in the same environment .
top lane rengar 's top lane match-ups range from managable to flat out terrible there are very few non-meta match-ups he is even slightly favoured in .
every experienced rengar player knows that you take exhaust and try to cheese level 1-3 for kills or at least to gain a big exp/creep advantage from the trade because you literally lose pretty much every single common top lane match-up at level 6 hard .
admittedly bruiser/tank rengar with w max first is a pretty safe lane in most matchups but you lose pretty much all kill and snowball potential compared to q max assassin rengar .
literally the only thing you have to do to beat top rengar is stay away from bushes at level 1-3 and you are golden .
whilst yi 's level 1-3 is n't nearly as cheesy as rengar 's although yi 's level 2 powerspike is actually pretty decent and his pre-6 is generally junk yi is actually a decently strong duelist at level 6 who loses much less matchups than most people realize if he is played by a competent yi player there 's a few korean top lane yi master/challenger yi players who you can watch to learn more .
jungle rengar 's first clear is absolutely trash in terms of sustain .
unless you get a solid leash you 'll probably end up around 50 or lower if you do a full clear without going to scuttle crab to regen some hp .
good junglers know that a rengar is very weak to invades and high elo rengar junglers often caution to take alternative routes when facing stuff like lee/kindred/nidalee because they will try to shut you down .
rengar 's pre-6 ganks are actually not bad because of his hard cc but he 's still pretty weak to counter-ganks/dueling in general unless he grabs a skirmisher 's .
post 6 rengar has strong ganks but early game without a youmuu's/bonetooth stacks there 's still a lot of time for enemies to react to your exclamation mark warning .
rengar like tf is highly dependent on the success of his first 2 to 3 post 6 to get snowballing since at rank 1 his r has a massive cooldown .
if he does n't get ganks off he farms the jungle rather slowly until he can buy a tiamat .
yi has one of the healthiest and fastest clears in the game from the very start thanks to meditate .
admittedly his pre-6 ganking presence is even weaker than rengar 's but yi wants to powerfarm to 6 which he is very good at .
past 6 yi 's ganks are n't bad even without cc due to how much sustained damage he has and he runs faster than rengar with highlander on .
unlike rengar yi is n't pressured to snowball as he can still just farm up his devourer knowing that he is one of the hardest scaling late game champions anyway .
dueling/assassination rengar has the highest single target burst in the game if building full crit there is no arguments there .
however some champs are hell for him to assassinate trist/vayne come to mind and zhonya 's on ap mids all but ensures their survival if it is n't a pure 1v1 with no allies nearby in which case any assassin will most likely kill you .
a 6-item darius or mundo will roll over you without losing even half their hp .
master yi whilst unable to match rengar in the 0-1.5 second range for burst deals much more sustained damage one of if not the highest dps in the game i believe .
his burst is also not too shabby q aa w reset aa takes less than a second to perform and the damage from a 6 item yi on squishies with this combo can almost if not outright 100-0 them .
more importantly a well played master yi is hands down the strongest 1v1 duelist in the game .
the only champions who give yi trouble are a nasus with an unrealistic amounts of stacks well over 1000 or a jax with a near full offensive build devourer gunblade rageblade botrk randuins tabi jax or selling randuins for triforce .
yi 's meditate makes him near invulnerable to burst champions as it basically gives him over 6000 ehp pre-resists when active due to 70 damage reduction .
under his ridiculous amounts of dps even a full tank build mundo or rammus melts in about 5~6 seconds .
as a consequence yi is also superior to rengar in split pushing .
not only does he duel better he also takes down towers a lot faster while retaining similar escape potential .
either he manages to oneshot the enemy squishies or he gets peeled and dies instantly .
rengar is actually far more powerful as a teamfighter when he builds bruiser/tank like the koreans do and plays as one of the best pick/initiating champs in the game but that 's not what players seem to be crying about .
master yi is perhaps the most dangerous champion late game to leave alone because he will pentakill your team if not focused down immediately .
assassins/fighters like rengar/fiora/diana/zed or other adcs/mages can be zoned off by tanks and dangerous bruisers like darius or mundo can be kited and whittled down by the adc/support/mid .
leave a tank alone against a yi and they are dead in 5 seconds .
leave a squishy alone against a yi and they are dead in 2 .
tl dr master yi exceeds rengar vastly as a solo queue stomper .
rengar is only stronger at level 1-3 in top laner or at level 6 as a jungler but yi beats him everywhere else .

hi guys.. ive got a couple of questions for a ship im using for ranked amagi specifically .
tactic wise i like to get in close and thankfully ranked players have the coordination to support worked well so far .
1 for the last modification slot should 1 take target acquisition or concealment modification .
which one gives more benefit for close range getting into a no miss range .
2 for the 4th captain skill should i take high alert or superintendent and does high alert which reduces time for damage control party stack up with prem consumables .

i noticed that the red ping is very loud and others are too quiet quiet and my idea is that when u open up settings there is a drop down menu where you can set the volume for each ping ex .
your support janna is going to ward tri-bush and u have a big wave undertower trying to focus on lasting hit them and the enemy leona goes to dive u cuz your support is warding ur jungled uses the loud red ping at janna becuz she is face checking and mid mias at the same time the jungles spams red ping missing the mia dying to the enemy katarina giving her 2 kills .
this happened to my bot lane and it 's really annoying how the red is so loud and if ur team is not looking at the map it 's hard to hear the ping

for instance an article about the war between syrian opposition and the syrian government is not an appropriate article for our subreddit nor one on syrian or russian or american or uk etc etc airstrikes in syria .
however an article on the recruitment methods of specific jihadist groups a working definition will be spelled out as the community comes to a consensus on what exactly that entails but for the moment an armed islamic group that believes in advancing the islamic cause through militant and violent jihad or a video/audio propaganda piece from one of those groups would absolutely be appropriate .
we aim to aggregate information and collaborate in translating/analyzing that information or sharing the noteworthy analyses of that information by notable individuals .
jihad and islamic extremism are incredibly important topics in the 21st century and they are also often incredibly misunderstood .
if you 're interested in learning more about the ideologies operational techniques recruitment propaganda or other facets of these groups or if you 're a knowledgeable voice interested in sharing what you know we welcome you to r/jihadinfocus to discuss and share information about an increasingly relevant aspect of the modern world .
i was working on christmas eve and things were pretty hectic .
we 're located in a pretty small town so there usually is n't a large amount of delivering to do .
because most of us want to stay useful most drivers know how to run everything store side .
i was up front running the register and this fella comes in pays for his order around 13 or so with a card .
he asks me hey how many people are working here tonight ? ''
it 's a bit odd but i do n't think much of it i tell him there 's four of us here tonight .
he writes 20 down in the tip box and tells me to give everyone 5 merry christmas .
i stutter a bit and start pouring on the thanks .
as he 's walking out the door i tell him he can take a drink if he wants we have a cooler right out front but he declines and goes on his way like any good hero .
i hand everyone their tip and we all wave at him as he leaves .
betcha ' you were wondering what was up with the gal who cleanly beat psycho ?
i 'm working on that shit and we got a human test subject comin ' on down !
though ... i might a teensy bit worried cause it 's my own girl melaine .
aw i 'm not sounding like i 'm very confident in our work huh ?
anyways she showed up a few days ago with a couple friends .
one called herself holly and explained a few things to myself william and mel-mel .
anywho we just got her vitals taken and all the pre-shoving-a-cure-into-her-blood stuff done and are juuuust about to pop the ol ' needle in !
what we 're banking on is that this boosts the activity of her immune system .
it is n't a complete cure as certain symptoms and traces of the infection are gunna remain but it should make her unable to pass on the strand to other humans through any means of contact .
spit cum blood ... all that fun stuff should be cleaner than clean .
restartin ' her whole body which is what would need to be done for a full cure is a little too risky and advanced .
the infection has already done a number on her vital systems removing it completely would probably kill her .
her body should start to repair tissue damage pump blood aannd the brain should start functioning without any drastic relapses though minor depression will still be evident .
the stuff we wo n't be able to hit is pretty major though .
for one thing we found that her nervous system has received major damage is certain areas which explains the numbness and tolerance to pain .
we also found that because she will no longer be an active distributer she will be vulnerable to the infection .
we suspect the ability to control the infected will still be present and the undead will not actively target her .
however she could now fully turn much like any human being if exposed to a bite or any other fluids from the undead .
but most of the nasty stuff 's gunna be gone licitly split !
i got ta go give salem this stuff now !
this is probably my favorite time period to learn about when it comes to asiatic history .
could anybody please recommend any good movies about this stage in history ?
note i 've already seen letters from iwo jima and city of life and death
i was going to buy 2 unusual taunts later and i was wondering what are the good effects and what are the bad ones ?
if somebody could provide me with some kind of list it 'd be great .
i asked for a toxoplasmosis screening per the suggestion of that expecting better book and it turns out i have some of the antibodies in my blood already .
that means i 'm not at risk for getting the disease .
we usually garden in warmer weather so that 's one less thing to worry about !
i get them constantly anyway regardless of the necessary precautions and a steady diet of cranberry supplements so i ca n't say i 'm surprised .
unfortunately due to morning sickness i can hardly stomach my heartburn meds .
not sure how it 's going to work taking three antibiotics a day .
anyone else have surprising news after their first appointments ?
i have is this way to reduce ips glow and it works significantly .
the problem is the bright spot that i am getting at the top right or if it was in normal orientation bottom left .
i know its bleed because that 's the only spot if viewed directly perpendicular is still bright .
if i lightly touch the spot with a cloth it darkens so i can only assume that the panel is not flush with the back light ?
i know pictures look worse then real life as anything else but that bright spot is pretty much black .
the contrast difference between bright spot and darkness surrounding it is fairly accurate if accounted for the overall brightness of the picture .
i looked up online and mine does n't look too bad but this is supposed to be a newer revision and i am not sure if i should try to rma it .
hey i was just wondering if you can get mechs in the current stable update .
i see on the wiki it says you find them from high tech chests but it has n't been updated in awhile so i just wanted to check with you guys .
alrighty so i 've been repairing this vita i got from a friend .
he stated that his left analog stick was n't working and he was pretty much done with the handheld himself and said i could have it .
so i tore down the console reaching that green board that makes contact with the left analog stick .
i take that apart and find some grime within the stick .
i clean that out and i figure while i 'm here might as well clean up the d-pad .
i get some alcohol and go over the contacts on the board itself for the d-pad and clean the d-pad and the membrane beneath the d-pad .
all seems well so i put it back together .
ca n't use it to navigate the menu and when i entered a game the d-pad moved in weird diagonal directions when i wanted to move in just one direction .
i should mention that the d-pad was working perfectly before i started working on the console .
i tore it down again hoping i just put something in the wrong spot but the problem persists .
any way i can fix it or am i stuck ?
this is a link https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=szn7lpciet4 to my second tape shy guise .
guise referring to the mask i donned as my persona .
the first track frostmourne loops somewhere around 2:30 i do n't even know how the hell that happened .
i 've been making music non-recreationally '' for about 2 years .
let me know what you guys think i still make lots of music
i appreciate feedback and also any tips cause i know i 'm very far from perfect .
because i ca n't post this in askscience without my thread getting reviewed '' first .
my reasoning is this the speed of light is always the same but its origin point is not .
therefore some photons should be reaching the reflecting source sooner .
disclaimer 1 this is only part 1 as there are a lot of mobs in the game .
if this post is well-received i 'll start working on part 2 but if nobody really cares about it i 'll just write it off so let me know if you want to read more !
from the studio that brought you greats like 'this difficulty rating fucking sucks' and 'this pvp etiquette fucking sucks' comes 'why the fuck did this nutter decide to rate the mobs ?
i 'll just start off by saying i 'm doing this for a bit of fun and hopefully to entertain some of you folks out there with my ramblings .
i 'll try to keep the ratings somewhat consistent .
disclaimer 2 okay so on my last ratings post a lot of the people commenting did n't really agree with my rating system as i rated as someone who was experienced with the game .
taking that into consideration this post will try to keep a balance on the difficulty rating .
remember skeleton take it with a grain of salt .
bullshit meter a combination of how glitchy/unfair/annoying a mob is .
without further ado lets start journey 2 to drangleic .
they look like a monkey-rat lovechild so no special rating here .
these would be rated a ten if we counted the start but if you have a weapon they 're no problem .
they can be hard to hit and earn a few points for how many people they 've killed who are playing the game for the first time .
these guys are pretty tough even later into the game .
these motherfuckers have the most retarded hitboxes especially when you start the game out with low agility .
oh and did i mention the glitched grab attack that one-shots you until you have like 40 vig ?
they have a jump-attack-thing that 's really hard to see coming and dodge .
and fuck getting cornered by them with a shit weapon .
no purse-user here since he 's technically a boss .
ca n't even see the little buggers in the grass .
why ca n't i fucking hit them with my weapon ?
oh yeah just once you think you far away from their grubby mitts elana decides to summon them and fuck your shit up .
if you ever see these do not try to fight .
the hat is the best hat in the game .
they can pose a threat if you wake up twenty of them .
fuck that slow they have even if you do n't get hit by the pancake attack .
i 'm saving the royal swordsmen for lost bastille .
when the best strategy to fight them is to use poison arrows you know they suck .
the only way to fight them in melee range is to out damage them since you ca n't dodge their attacks .
oh wait they 're ranged too and do stupid damage ?
these are some tough cookies even as an experienced player .
the hammer bros have unlimited stamina and fast combos .
i already rated this guy on me boss ratings post but i really wanted to rate him as a mob so here you go .
i was doing some low-level royal swordsman sunbro-ing on pc to help the new players with a bit of good ol ' cosplay .
the amount of people who died to this guy was ridiculous .
you have to just run straight at him no pausing .
if you aggro him and do n't get under him straight up he will spam fire attacks all day that are almost impossible to get by .
also if you look close enough you can actually see their pubes .
oh look at me jump i 'm a ninja mum !
have fun with the stunlock and try not to get petrified .
the only way to fight them is with gravity .
probably a 6 if you want a serious rating .
i did all the way up to sinner so i thought that was a good place to stop for now since i started to get real tired towards the end .
tell me what you think if you have a differing opinion .
what 's your most bullshit enemy up to sinner ?
fuckpigs are the most difficult enemy in the game .
not knocking them but i have noticed that they are a lot more similar than any two juices from other places that i 've brought juice from .
heres the ones i 've tried ombipom moo fields mars milk of the poppy and blues greek yoghurt .
was wondering if anyone else had the same experience with blue dot vapor and/or other places or it 's just me ?
edit i should add that i mean no disrespect .
all there is now is thunderlords everywhere it seems like anything else is not even worth taking ...
the visus procul or the vp as the crew called it was an exploration vessel .
you were part of the crew before its ... demise .
the ship had dropped in light years away from the rest of humanity in a previously unexplored system .
you were n't sure what exactly went wrong but judging by the lack of other escape pods you were the only survivor .
it gave you some time to reflect about your career path .
were you part of the landing crew that would get sent on missions down to the uncharted planets ?
you might have been a soldier chosen to protect the rest of the crew or maybe the squad medic .
you felt that establishing to yourself what you did would play a role in how your future played out .
of course if it was too much to think about now you did n't have to answer the question .
a camera aimed behind the pod would reveal the vp collapsing in on itself and you had to face the fact that this pod was your new home for now .
a glowing screen would ask where you wanted to go with several options lit up .
each planet had a small blurb written next to it consisting of tidbits of information the ground crew had posted about it .
you only had enough fuel to make it to one planet and crash there .
let 's start with selecting a planet and optionally a bit of a backstory on your character then we go from there .
all of the names are in latin which usually reveals a bit about the planet when translated .
the scene ends once your character dies manages to find a way to survive indefinitely or is somehow rescued .
the scene will be sfw by default but of course i 'm a versatile writer .
i will continue replying as long as anyone cares to play .
any place to get used ski equipment other than kijiji ?
are there ever ski swaps or stores that sell used skis boots and poles ?
this is based on the templar from the video game dragon age a holy knight devoted to slaying evil mages .
the oath of the templar is a commitment to protect people from arcane mages .
when a lich creates an army of undead and threatens the kingdom or when a warlock summons demons to do his bidding templars are called to protect the land .
to a templar any arcane mage has the potential to be evil and must be closely watched to prevent great evil .
watch the mages magic can be used for great evil .
protect the innocent protect those that would be harmed by magic .
stop the evil mages if a mage steps out of line do not hesitate to exterminate the mage .
you gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed .
when you take this oath at 3rd level you gain the following two channel divinity options
as an action you can attempt to purge an area of magic using your channel divinity .
choose one creature object or magic effect within range .
for each spell on the target make an ability check using charisma modifier .
the dc for this check is equal to the spell save dc of the creature that created the effect .
if a creature did not create the effect and the effect can be cleansed the dc is set by the dm .
you gain the ability to better protect yourself from magical effects .
when you see a creature casts a spell that requires a saving throw you can use your reaction to grant yourself advantage on the saving throw to resist the effects of the spell using your channel divinity .
beginning at 7th level the power in your blood forms a ward against magic .
in addition you can add your proficiency bonus to checks made to dispel magic such as with the spell dispel magic and with cleanse magic .
starting at 15th level you have perfected the art of fighting wizards and other magic users .
whenever you hit an arcane magic user such as anyone who has class levels in bard sorcerer warlock or wizard with a melee attack the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage .
in addition if the arcane magic user is concentrating on a spell that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its concentration .
in addition you have advantage on all intelligence wisdom and charisma saving throws against magic .
at 20th level you can assume the form of the perfect mage slayer .
as an action you create an area of antimagic as in the antimagic field spell in a 10-foot radius surrounding yourself .
this antimagic field only affects arcane magic including all spells cast by a bard sorcerer warlock or wizard .
this field has no effect on divine magic such as spells cast by a cleric druid paladin or ranger .
magic items work normally except for magic items attuned to an arcane caster .
once you use this feature you ca n't use it again until you finish a long rest .
i 'm not sold on aura of purity or circle of power as oath spells .
any better ideas for cleansing non spell effects besides just saying set by the dm '' ?
what would you guys think about frames that you would get by maxing out devotion to each syndicate ?
they could be designed around the themes of the synds visually and their powers .
i just maxed out devotion to a synd and found it to be underwhelming leaving me with no motivation to do any others i 'll just buy any of the exclusive mods i want and everything else is meh .
has anyone tried any of fresh-kratom 's new stock ?
i just ordered some red md and was wondering if anyone has any experience with it .
hello i am a modest gamer new to the console scene .
i am about to buy my third game for my new console after taking a couple years break from gaming .
i am trying to decide between metal gear solid v pp w online or destiny ttk .
i am into shooters and my main priority is multiplayer .
less with friends i know irl and more just randoms i meet in-game .
i am not too much of a fan of singleplayer but will still play it since its important part of both games .
i am not too much a fan of cod style games where its just sort of arcade and everyone runs around by themselves .
i prefer games that have a bit more to offer whether that be a more tactical/team based approach like rainbow6 which i am enjoying atm .
or a sort of rpg/sci fi system with destiny .
i have watched a lot of the multiplayer aspects of both destiny and msg and they really interest me .
but while msg seems to have a great singleplayer how active is the online community ?
it seems like online is just an extra sideshow compared to destiny where it is a more prominent part of the title .
anyways would anyone else more familiar with both titles have anything to chip in ?
i am just looking for the game that i can just get into during my evenings and just enjoy myself without having to necessarily dedicate much of my time towards building a storyline or anything like that .
ultimately my goal is just to have a competitive multiplayer game that i can enjoy for a long time .
remember how nearly all of us were in awe when the news broke https m.reddit.com/r/falcons/comments/2zi98r/biermann_is_back that he was coming back ?
now looking back his pass rushing is still damn bad but his run stuffing ability has earnt him the 18th best lb grade from pff at 9.3 14.4 for run defense .
quietly he 's had a great season and no one would be surprised if we re-signed him once more .
narrowing down his roles in quinn 's system has really worked out for kroy .
i was wondering how many keys my knife worth .
i would like to know if that is it and what would be the normal price to sell not qs ?
so in 2012 there was this awesome project called lepsis https vimeo.com/55695909 .
now almost 4 years later i was looking around but i could n't find anything like it to buy or any update on how far they have come with their project .
on a related note do all grasshoppers taste the same ?
that means can i just buy the grasshoppers from our local pet shop and breed them and feed them with vegetables for flavour and they will be just as tasty as specially delivered ones from a entomophagy shop ?
i heard they would be somewhat moldier '' tasting .
we started our son in a daycare this monday which was awful .
they blasted music to drown out the babies crying and ignored them for 20mins .
one of the ladies picked babies up by just one arm and he came home in a size 1 diaper when i provided them with size 3 's his butt was as wrinkly as his scrotum that day .
so we pulled him out and thankfully my mother in law and dad were able to take over for the rest of the week .
we called around and found out that only 3 daycares in this whole city had openings and picked the best one out of the three .
i am just not a 100 comfortable with this place either .
they have a lot of swings bouncers and exercausers .
the babies sleep in a crib room and when i asked how they hear the babies they just said they leave the door to the room open i do n't like that it seems like it could be very easy to miss a baby crying .
my grandmother who lives in south asia we 're south asian has offered to come and watch him .
she watched both my brother and me until we were three years old .
there 's some minor safety concerns as american safety standards do n't exist where we 're from .
while she will make sure he 's fed changed and content i do n't think she would read to him have music time or those other things that daycare will supposedly provide .
we will talk to her about having plenty of floor and tummy time and provide her with a bouncer swing stroller etc ... so that she has everything to soothe him .
i am just torn on which situation is better .
with my grandma he only has one caretaker and will never cry or have to share attention but he 'll be missing out on a lot of the engagement that daycares say they offer .
does anyone have any experience with petitioning the graduate college to keep an assistantship while on academic probation ?
i am extremely worried about losing my research position due to getting a c in my first semester of grad school and need some advice .
honestly i was just overwhelmed my first semester and did n't do very well and i do n't want this to be the cause of me losing my assistantship .
sorry if this is a re-post i could n't find anything specifically relevant to my situation .
currently work for a hotel/casino in las vegas and may have an interview at a competing company for an corporate marketing analyst position .
i need to be able to demonstrate excel proficiency and to do so i would like to bring along with me some reports i have created for my department .
these reports have financial information on them regarding revenue not full financial statements .
i do n't want to cross any ethical line here .
my questions is there anything i can/need to do to present these reports in an interview in an ethical way other than simply changing the numbers ?
i like to listen to what i call electronic instrumental nonvocal music .
little people deadmau5 fc kahuna the glitch mob emancipator bonobo c2c ... maybe that helps .

does anyone know where to buy them in greater victoria ?
ela tem tudo que um cara poderia querer para namorar √© muito bonita divertida √≥tima companhia para sa√≠das etc .
e eu a amei mais do que tudo durante um ano e meio .
entretanto nesse per√≠odo sofri todo tipo de sacanagem que poderia esperar mentira trai√ß√£o dissimula√ß√£o falta de considera√ß√£o egocentrismo e mt ego√≠smo .
ent√£o depois de muito sofrer decidi terminar ainda gostando dela .
apesar disso o grande problema eh apenas um saber lidar com a saudade pois eh isso que me faz continuamente falar com ela e me prender por algu√©m que segue a vida na boa sem mim .
explico melhor eu tento me afastar e chego a ficar at√© uma semana sem falar com ela por mensagem mas sempre ela volta p falar e n√£o consigo simplesmente ignorar ou pedir p ela n√£o falar mais .
s√≥ que quando ela fala eh sempre para me usar para aumentar ego dela pois ela tem crises de beleza ou para saber se j√° t√¥ ficando com outras e assim come√ßar a me dar falsas esperan√ßas ou ainda para simplesmente me pisar e se sentir superior falando coisas que sabe que vai me atingir .
ent√£o estou num problema de um lado quando ela fala comigo eu sofro e se ela n√£o fala eu fico com uma saudade extrema .
no expectations about your time commitment because we 're doing this for fun .

my sister said squirming as i cupped a generous handful of her firm tanned butt .
i waited a few moments until she returned her attention to the soccer game on tv then i reached up again and spread my palm across her right cheek .
i squeezed and groped my teenage sister 's plump rump while she tried her best to ignore me .
i crept closer and closer to her on the bed until my upper body was draped across her back .
we were both shirtless and my chest and stomach pressed against her warm soft lower back .
off to one side the roach from the joint we had shared sat forgotten in a smudged glass ashtray .
come on '' i said mom and dad wo n't be home for hours .
i bet i 'm not the only one '' i said pressing the growing bulge in my underwear against her panty-clad ass .
i pumped my hips slowly dragging my clothed cock up and down her ass .
fuuuuck '' my sister moaned her face pressed into the bed .
when i slid my fingers into the waistband of her panties and tugged them down she did n't stop me .
she kept her eyes focused on the tv but i could her her shallow breathing .
i rolled down my sister 's underwear with slow deliberate care .
i bent in close letting her feel my breath on her round bottom .
i raised myself to my knees and tugged down my briefs .
i held my swollen cock in one hand letting it grow to a full seven-inch erection .
my sister glanced back over her shoulder and quickly buried her face in the bedspread again .
the unspoken rule seemed to be as long as i do n't acknowledge him we 're not doing anything wrong .
i tugged the panties down a little further revealing the top of her pink slit .
my sister was as visibly aroused as i was .
she said breathily and deliberately do n't fuck me . ''
i reached over to the nightstand grabbed a bottle of lotion and squirted some on my fingers .
i pressed them between my sister 's asscheeks rubbing them up and down her virgin crack .
she moaned as my long square fingers rubbed her dark cleft .
i grasped my cock and bounced it up and down slapping it off my sister 's ass with a soft thwack thwack ! ''
i took a double handful of my sister 's ass spread her slightly and threaded my cock between her globes like a hotdog in a bun .
i squeezed her buttocks back together sandwiching my prick and began to thrust .
the tip of my cock slid in and out the far side of her ass occasionally bumping against the small of her back .
the pace of the soccer game began to speed up as one team drove for the goal .
she moaned quietly finding it harder to concentrate on the tv but she never turned around .
as the center ran towards the goal my strokes increased in speed my cock gliding in and out of the well-lubed channel between my sister 's lower cheeks .
she moaned in time with me and started to hump back .
the crotch of her panties the part that still covered her pussy was soaked .
fuck i 've got ta cum '' i announced .
as the center lined up his shot my prick burst .
ropes of hot jizz shot across her ass and up her back .
i kept cumming for what seemed like forever pumping out blast after blast until my aching balls were completely empty .
my sister was spattered from ass to shoulder crisscrossed with streaks of pearly cum .
she lay facedown no longer watching the game just breathing hard .
she was quiet for a little while and then she finally spoke .
i squeezed her thighs my hands coming close to the soaked triangle of fabric between her legs .
i 've just started playing eq2 i rolled a dirge which is a unique type of class i 've never really played .
i 'm wondering which servers are the most populated best to settle down on ?
i levelled my fishing skill i am now level 50 .
so i finally convinced my older sister to play terraria with me .
i 've only played as an archer/summoner so i have no clue how to get good mage/warrior items or even where to start ...
so my question is this what should i get first as a mage and what can she get as a warrior to start us off on terraria ?
we 're only 4 game days in she is recording for her youtube channel and we just recorded 4 episodes for tonight and we have 11 gold bars and a pair of flippers as our only good '' items .
she is using the cactus sword and i am using a wooden bow currently
so i 'm a senior in high school and i 've been playing magic the gathering for about 4 years i picked it up as a freshman .
in the beginning i borrowed cards from my brother and from the teacher who ran the after school game club .
since i did n't buy these i was more inclined to trade or give them to people who had more use of them .
however recently i have been building my collection with the money that i earn from my job .
i came into the possession of some very good ones recently .
now about a month ago i started sitting with these sophomores at lunch who all play magic .
i figured it was good for me to have someone to look up to when i was an underclassmen so i wanted to be that guy .
okay so here 's where the real story starts .
one of these kids let 's call him steve very rarely has lunch or money to buy lunch .
i figured he probably doenst have a very good home life or whatever so sometimes i 'd lend him a buck or two so he could eat .
whatever right i 'm a nice guy and it 's not a lot of money for me .
i also give him and his other friends advice on magic been playing it longer and recommend what cards they can buy and such .
i try to be nice to these guys and fair .
today jan 7 2016 another kid that sits at our table and is friends with steve let 's call him joe is arguing with him .
naturally wanting to be the 'adult ' in this situation i ask him what 's wrong .
they both start arguing again and from what i understand steve now has some really quite rare powerful and expensive magic cards that joe also had .
joe coincidentally can not find his copies of those cards anywhere .
naturally assumptions start flying the word 'theif ' gets tossed around and there are generally some tense emotions .
not wanting these kids to get worked up and possibly ruin their friendships i try to work stuff out and calm them down .
joe ends up storming off having taken the cards steve allegedly stole and leaving .
i then tell steve that if he did take them he should come clean and apologize because he should n't risk a friend over some pieces of cardboard '' sides also form among the others but i generally am able to keep everyone calm .
i recently purchased with my christmas money a bulk pack of nearly 1600 cards .
i had finished sorting them and was ready to add them to my decks .
as i look through my decks i start to notice certain cards are missing .
certain cards that steve had suddenly started using ... .cards that were primary sources of my wins and now were primary sources for his .
naturally i start to make assumptions but i do n't want to be rash so i try to think .
then i remember that earlier steve had requested to look through '' some of my decks .
after that happened i had n't touched my cards for about 3 days .
and i know for a fact the last time i looked through they were there .
so the fact of the matter is this i 've been nothing but nice and actually very very generous with this kid .
i even defended him when he was accused of stealing .
now i know that he did steal my things .
i 've treated you so well and now you 're going to be the worst type of person and act like you did n't take those cards from me ?
you do n't even bat an eye when i continue being nice to you or keep winning while using someone else 's strategy and cards ?
i want my cards back and i want him to recognize some guilt for what he 's done .
i 'm also looking to get some petty revenge .
he 's generally a good person to hang out with so i do n't want to lose him as a friend but what he did is so douchey and downright disgraceful it borders on sociopathy .
tl dr kid i was super nice to stole from me how to get him to confess ?
hello everyone i am currently doing a school project on the question of evil and our personal moral code .

i just rewatched interstellar the other night and i welled up at least a couple of times .
this does n't happen alot when i watch stuff .
i checked rotten tomatoes and its sitting on a 71 fresh rating .
some of the critics are really harsh as well .
i loved it the first time i saw it and can say it holds up the second time as well .
the wishy washy black hole book shelf stuff is really the only bit that 's not great .
well now that i think about it i agree too .
it 's realty hard to pull up wishlist on mobile so i 'll cheat on the commenting to ask you what 's your favorite high priced item on your wishlist and why ?
a bog is a type of terrain peat is a type of moss https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sphagnum
do you really think that most or even some of the sustenance farmers and traders of the 700 's had silver inlaid decorated axes ?
i think that the axe you linked is not very common .
you should think again if you thought that it was used for anything other than decoration to be honest .
from wikipedia ... richly decorated on both sides with inlaid silver designs the iron axe was probably a ceremonial parade weapon that was the property of a man of princely status his burial clothes bearing elaborate embroidery and trimmed with silk and fur . ''
there were dane axes and other specialized axe weapons but from everything i 've read normal wood axes were overwhelmingly common for non career warriors like plenty of vikings .
i 'm not sure he knows what a y axis is .
jules is already comming back so i would pick dion
variable obj_creature_handle.xs 100033 2147483648 not set before reading it .
was playing bully used a level orb with a grumbul aggro 'd on me took heavy lifting perk rolled and pressed the input to lift him .
exactly if you 're extremely poor it 's a financial decision if you 're just poor it 's a knowledge and access thing i think
afaict jews and irish catholics were n't pursuing the political dominance of their faith in any strongly organized manner
people have been claiming that jews are running and controling the banks and media and government for a long time .
basically we 've somewhat stopped blaming the jews and started blaming muslims for wanting to control everything .
that seemed like a pretty strong analogy to me .
regarding the irish was n't that what the whole conflict in ireland was about ?
just against some friends to test out a card .
demographic who you want to answer your survey age country characteristics etc .
this submission has been removed but feel free to resubmit with an appropriate title !
and do n't hesitate to ask if you have any questions .
they look like those gloves you used to get from game banana over design and ugly .
the amount of shit he did privately to make up for his failings was enormous .
i do n't give a shit for every one of those there 's about 20 in here from yanks telling germany it needs to exterminate refugees because a couple of people out of millions coming from deplorable living conditions are causing issues .
no shit people do stuff like this in every country anyway and even though i do often see comments from americans saying all their problems are because of black people how come no push to cleanse them all from society ?
oh i guess that would be racist because they are n't immigrants .
i 'm a day one global player that has spent 700 mythril searching for a wall relic .
i wo n't even show you my jp account that started during the 1 year anniversary it 's disgusting .
i 'm just saying this is bungie expect the expected .
i would support muzzling as well as a risk mitigation strategy .
unfortunately i do n't really know enough to comment on any facilities that might exist near you but i would suggest as a possibility contacting the aspca or best friends animal society or any other groups you can locate in your area that work with puppy mill survivors rescued fighting dogs and cruelty seizures .
shoot them an email and they may know of any rehabilitation programs facilities in your area that may be able to offer some assistance .
late edit also thank-you for everything you 've done so far .
even if it does n't work out for you it happens do n't feel bad .
you 've already given this dog a better shot at making it then thousands are given every day .
i 'd actually argue since that to take the ritual caster feat you only need to have 13 int or 13 wisdom and not the ability to cast any spells yourself that they do n't really require a power source outside of knowing the ritual and having whatever components are needed for it .
one i love supreme bc of their absurd collabo and accessories ideas..like yes water pistols fuckin raft which i own 2 for the fuck of it salt-n-pepper shakers crowbar a fuckin crowbar all sort of carryable knives and sharp objects airhorn lmao as i write .
hermes-themed ashtrays miles davis cd set i can go on for hours but supreme is in its own world for these kind of accessories .
its almost like they see something on the desk or in garage and say i wish that had a supreme logo on it '' and they make it which is pretty crazy and manufacturing/selling power if you think about it .
two to whom would i stunt my water guns ?
its just there for display i go on a vacay then i bring them and the raft volleyball .
you dont see star wars fanatics bring their lightsabers to school to stunt but to comic cons or whatever the gathering they have .
and its just for my viewing pleasure man i like what i see .
part of your face is covered by a phone its at an angle grainy and in a mirror .
from what i can see you do n't look ugly .
reminds me of the time i plunged head-first into your mother 's vasty deep .
after 4 days and nights without food or water i finally scaled the outer rim heh and escaped barely alive .
honestly no it 's a game mechanic and a proper way to score
if it was general or both i 'd be less worried .
his eyes widen then close happily he holds her close .
i 'm not a huge fan of leds on my mouse so i disabled all the led lighting on my steelseries rival much better without it tbh .
the british governed hong kong better than the chinese are now .
handing it over was a very reluctant process and a lot of hong kong citizens have a very dim view of the chinese government .
this is just one example but the british empire has borne and positively influenced many of the wealthiest and prosperous countries in the world and exported what is widely regarded as the best judicial system to many nations .
it is also responsible for some terrible and heinous crimes particularly in africa .
my original point was to say that when people talk about colonialism they should steer away from making sweeping generalisations because it 's far more complicated .
when you give items to a f2p it does n't matter .
also they have the capability of trading the items you give them .
you could potentially give them something to start trading and eventually they could get a premium gift for themselves .
just went to go see it ... .it was sold out .
i once asked someone holding this view if it would therefore be possible to be racist against a white person in a country where white people are not the dominant race let 's say saudi arabia for example .
they still could n't concede that you could act racistly against a white person even then despite the systems of power being designed to favour those of middle eastern descent instead blaming it on patriarchy '' or simply saying that we ca n't apply the same logic to a different culture .
it just seems like so many people have thrown the baby out with the bathwater wrt the logic of all this .
i often forget to take my meds or i lose them and find them again like this .
i have a pretty significant stash for stuff like this .
if it 's one time i 'm sure you doctor wo n't care .
if it 's frequently they 're going to think you 're dealing .
they 're not popular afaik but the media went crazy when people heard they were for sale in london .
a lot coercion is created by stress as well .
it is not heights it is splattering on the ground that is scary .
or you figure out that being interviewed about your cricket is n't the place to hit on a woman .
hitting on someone in the middle of an interview is fucking stupid as hell but the foaming at the mouth rage response speaks to a larger societal sentiment .
depends on how the call comes in and the information you provide to dispatch .
this has been annoying me for a week or two when full screening the videos on my nexus 7 latest os and youtube update .
think it might have happened on my old lg g2 too .
i wonder how many trump supporters protested bernie or hillary or anybody else .
should 've just fixed this issue for quartz ridge and ns refinery on indar .
i actually have a great and huge biography on nixon that goes very deeply into his presidency and such at home .
i 'll try to remember to get back to you with the title if you 're interested .
even using the curser is dumb when you can just use another tab of reddit .
i have a hard time playin fps or even games like fallout even in third person because i get motion sickness
they are playing the same game but their gripes are varied .
this game is still missing a ton of features and has some issues that people are waiting to get fixed .
that said most of what it does it does well and i look forward to what is planned for it .
alot of people would n't have though twice about it but you setting an example of the right way to handle the situation and not treating hjm like numbers on a sheet restores some faith in humanity .
i guess i misread the second gw bush clue and seem to have skimmed over a few numbers .
she misses high wholesome hobo homilies at least all of the words are words although i still do n't get it sp
i 'm one of those who were ok with the price and pre-ordered but the climate of discussion on this sub was way too toxic for me to comment anywhere especially with all the people from r/all r/pcmr and r/games coming here yesterday .
i 'm sure lots of other regular users here felt the same so we waited till today to have at least somewhat moderate discussions .
3 orihalcum dirk v my 5th already have 3 so it 's an upgrade mat

seriously i have no idea how germans view themselves with regard to wwii .
a columnist for the left-leaning new statesman wrote a tirade about free-speech fundamentalists.
in the past hasan has labeled non-believers cattle '' all the while demanding that muslims are treated with the highest respect and deference .
and if you think this fucking hypocritical god botherer is some kind of fringe lunatic not representative of european liberals you should know that he currently serves as the political editor for the british version of the huffington post .
so hes raising money for the homeless for a limited time and this is a forum that can legit spread word in a tangible way and you 're bitching about seeing news of it too much ?
we spend a ton of time in our cars .
although many long-time manual drivers will insist it 's no less convenient than an automatic they 're wrong .
having an auto means a 100 free hand to eat smoke talk ...
at one point steel was flanking two enemies with the awp and takes forever to shoot and miss .
then after he got shot he claimed he wanted to knife .
you want checks open up the lists and let the general public use them why would n't you ?
even if we could somehow 100 eliminate all illegal uses of guns every murder every suicide every illegal brandishing they would still hate guns .
in their progressive echo chambers they would still look at trayvon martin 's old smiling pre-pubescent snapshot and tell each other that his only crime was loving skittles too much .
and if anyone managed to sneak into their safe space '' and mention the backpack full of stolen jewelry he was caught with the photo of the pistol etc .
they would still be horrified to see responsibly armed citizens openly carrying handguns for self defence .
if they admit that guns make people safer then they have to accept that they are needlessly vulnerable and weak because they choose not to have guns and they hate that .
granlund pominville could n't hit the ocean if he were standing on the damn beach ftfy
the problem is the people it would be fun to roast are not on here ... we are swamped with wet dishclothes clogging the drain pipe and now there is a backup of shit everywhere .
just like in life the ones who should be posting are n't so the second rates step up and try to be twice as loud to compensate .
probably the key combinations shown and used in the tutorial and probably the tutorial was recorded in mac .
especially because i was running gw with 2 reproach and 2 sheer drop and a smite the monterous .

i 've decided to take my art a lot more seriously recently .

kissxsis is prob hands down the funniest show i have ever watched .
amagi brilliant park was also great the jokes never got old
well let me show you how i look then to give you a reference .
some might call me a womanizer '' so do n't be alarmed if you are less handsome and/or less beautiful than me that 's perfectly normal .
personally i disagree with people requesting special treatment for being in the military .
unless you were drafted joining up was most likely your choice and i know there are people forced into it and instead of going to school you wanted to serve your country '' in a war you do n't even understand because you did n't pay attention to shit in high school .
and i 'm not saying all soldiers are stupid i know some smart ones and i go to school with vets .
but of the people i went to high school with that enlisted they were all assholes with bad grades and bad attitudes .
it 's just not right for people 's tax money to fund the soldiers while they 're on duty then fund their schooling and then fund their lives when they get va benefits .
it 's a choice that you make and you 're choosing to join one of the most corrupt divisions of power this country has rather than go to school because you either got awful grades and nearly flunked out with no hope for college or you do n't know what you want to do with your life so instead you join the military .
no you should n't be able to own an rpg.. automatic rifles are already legal you have to go through the nfa though .
i do n't even know why you asked that .
i think it 's great he 's trying to make the show his own and he should .
i 'm just weary about the changes that are being made .
i would say wand as this advances your magic level which in turn increases your damage .
you can very well also use a sword when you are lower level this is mostly done when you want to make some profit and not waste generally mages tend to waste .
technically wand plus the strike spell is good enough early game .
you can start using the aoe runes but make sure you are making it worth it and hunting in places you can run a bunch of creatures at the same time .
technically sd is the end game rune still as it has the highest single target dmg .
it 's not advised to use it on monsters as the price per sd is high unless you got cash to blow and wanted to use it to try to powelevel sding stronger creates at like level 50 with magic shield dls perhaps .
if you have any other questions let me know .
yeah i was thinking about how many people signed this due to their concerns of what this would do to their property value .
so ... not interested in defending your stance just going to drop it as an irreconcilable difference ?
i played mech4 and some of the closed beta .
game is mechwarrior so if you like mechwarrior then you should hop on and play some rounds .
she applied for an african-american only '' scholarship for college and got it .
you need to be honest with him about his attitude or lack of it .
and need to be able to communicate how he makes you feel .
because you need to have a good professional bond with him .
this ca n't be completed if you feel inadequate .
it 's easy to forget that all spaceships are made of jell-o .
to deflate there is a valve that i squeeze .
i squeeze my penis and it pretty much sends the fluid right back to the reservoir .
if i was going to include belfour i 'd put him ahead of roy but i think some chucklefuck in an avs jersey might show up at my house and murder me .
yes all isps talk in terms of mbps all lowercase .
if they 're talking about speed downloading then it 's impossible for 24mbps to be faster than 60mbps .
does n't matter if it 's fiber or cable .
however if you did a lot of uploading cloud backups torrenting etc then the 60mbps upload will be faster than 10mbps upload .
however most people judge their isp by the download speed .
for online gaming fiber can be better not necessarily faster than cable as there is often less lag .
well i 'm 28 and in my entire life i 've crushed on like 4 people .
it always really surprises me when it happens and between them there is n't a physical type .
i guess i can identify some personality traits when i think about it ...
point is if it is n't happening for you yet it is n't a problem .
it 's not that your standards are too high or that you 're not good enough for them or anything like that you just have n't met the right person yet .
but when you do meet her you 'd better make sure you put your best foot forward to help you both realise that .
make sure you look and smell nice and do n't come across all desperate and needy make her feel like you 're interested in her and not just the idea of someone .
i always thought about asking them to hang out more but i dont know if that would come across as weird or clingy .
but you 'll probably just come across as a cool guy who 's brave enough to ask for help .
just try your best and do n't be a downer .
because robots will put those kids out of a job .
i personally think boiled chicken is alright but that might be because there 's always soy sauce at home .
granted the stuff on the plate also looks cold and cold chicken tends to be not that great .
well i mean you 're saying the guy has said things you already know .
the guy is clearly posting a genuine opinion of the game on a relative subreddit what 's the issue ?
well if you 're already putting it on anyway during that time might as well snap a few pictures !
if you look on the ship stats page https robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/carrack/carrack holo-viewer you can see that the carrack comes with two size 4 manned and two size 4 unmanned turrets no missiles and a max shield size 7 .
while i ca n't complain about the shields the weapons are a bit lacking for a military ship .
honestly the constellation andromeda https robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/rsi-constellation/constellation-andromeda with four size 4 gimbal mounts two size 4 manned turrets 28 size 1 missiles 20 size 2 missiles and a max shield size 6 looks like it could own the carrack in a 1v1 .
as it currently is the carrack seems to be geared only toward exploration .
it 's weapons are lacking when compared to a ship that should be considered a multi-role non military ship .
i think it will end up as a pretty descent if not awesome exploration vessel but the should also make a military varient as well .
i mean the civilian carrak may even just be a stripped down military version .
who 's to say they just would n't sell the military version because it was too lethal or something .
all we can do now is wait and see how it ends up .
they make them up to 1/2 '' long just so you know .
well said sad to see someone i used to enjoy in 2012/2013 turn into this .
well i mean he 's an ahl all star that 's how
when did we change from the original scumbag stacy and why ?

yet she able to get a company that has never been a sponsor in nascar before to not only get involved but to invest heavily into her and her team .
the amount of exposure for her is still way above a lot of other drivers and probably always will be during her racing career .

my point is that if you do n't want to have sex with your partner ever then you 're just friends who share a bed and bills .
you ca n't be interested in beer without being a beer snob and if you dare to say that one beer taste different than another ?

as crazy as it sounds discussing politics is a good way to unwind .
they are going to die soon and i really want them and the mao slide to have a proper chinaball not just a ghost .
also pretty much all of the super important ones have been drawn so china should have the next one .
there 's no erosion of gun rights extended background checks were albeit reactionary something that ca n't harm any lawful gun owners .
i have a very hard time believing trump would take the nation to a better place in the global scheme of things .
shutting our borders might sound great but we are a globalized country and rather than eschewing other countries ' influence we should embrace and grow with it such that evils like terrorism can be eradicated or at least controlled on a wider scale .
i understand that but like i 'm asking why it 's important that an average be used .
one advantage is that you instantly know what you 're looking at is money and not a random number .
that might sound pointless but it can be useful for example when looking at a document that talks about both the quantity and value of something .
i kinda envisioned this to be a way to show the tradeskill cards as a burrow dynamic like spare parts are for putting cards in-hand .
they 're not intended to synergize '' ... per se ... just be bonuses .
what a great series of passes at the end there .
the whole third period plus overtime was some stressful fucking hockey .

that sounds like a defense mechanism response by rose haha .
the question inferring that he is old at all .
i agree that considering his history you have reason to not want him to engage in these activities .
i had heard a rumour that they were considering it but i do n't know how likely it is .
the banjo series is still my favourite couple of n64 games .
could we use the shirou one from the carnival phantasm opening .
it 's like it was created to be a comment face .
they said that it would n't be at e3 .
and yet people thought ha ha silly nintendo we 're on to you lol '' .
why people were upset when it was n't at e3 is lost to me .
edit matter of fact they never said it would be at e3 so how you got that idea is confusing me .
coconut candy ... best things i can equate it to would be a fainter version of coco lopez canned coconut cream after its chilled or the slightly less sweet white side of one of these http media.candystore.com/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/k/e/key-lime-pie-bulk-candy-5lb_2.jpg
it 's sweet slightly waxy slightly creamy a bit less complex than coconut extra or fa or flv coconut

if someone is carrying in a concealed manner no .
if someone is openly carrying then yes that has the potential for the moment to escalate to undesirable ends .
however the mere possession of a gun if by licensing and responsible ownership no .
why is it folks seem to assume so readily that people who carry are the john wayne type .
anyone who flagrantly waves a firearm around is doing it wrong .
do please share an example where a legally carrying individual 's firearm went off without premeditation or accident .
guns do n't just go off you do n't trip and fall and suddenly someone is bleeding profusely from a sucking chest wound .

well yeah man the only reason lactase persistence which is the trait that appears lactose intolerance is not the trait that disappears it is the normal state of a human being historically is so prevalent in europe is that everybody who could n't eat milk butter and cheese starved to death .

i feel like so many of these phrases could be easily mistaken .
i 've had one or two times in my life where i read a phrase for so long and heard a spoken phrase for a long time as well and eventually realized they were the same phrase though i realized they had roughly the same meaning .
the words in the book did n't really match the pronunciation or something .
eventually it clicks and you feel like a moron .
arguing with someone about it would make me feel dumb though .

if you are humiliated and want more ignoring from me pm me ... dunce .

hell most movie theaters have been slow to transition to 4k and digital imax is just now starting to make the transition to 4k as well contrary to popular belief digital imax is only projected in 2k today outside of the new laser imax systems .
most people would see more of an improvement in video quality at home from properly calibrating their current tvs then they would from moving to a 4k set .

mack switched sides for the 4th sack then came back for the 5th .
what confused me was that they said what you 'll need to bring with you '' as opposed to what you have to have on hand .
that 's not how it works you fucking idiot .
but by how you type i can tell you 're not too bright .
i do however believe that culture shock could have played a large part here not that it in anyway justifys what went on but could provide insight as to why this happened and allow the people to readjust the way these people are introduced to society .

just to be clear i 've only benchmarked the two with php .
that said i 've done a lot of benchmarking on the both of them for wordpress related build automation for the hosting provider i work for .
out of the box apache and nginx serve the same amount of requests per second around 3-4 depending on the size of your server incredibly poor performance .
but then you start adding various forms of caching and this number easily goes up to 60-120 rps on a small server .
all of the caching and optimization tuning equal i can get nginx to perform about 10-20 higher than apache .
also be extremely wary of benchmarks online most people will use apachebench and will perform the tests again http domain instead of http www. domain what that means is the benchmark is done against the 301 redirect and not the full page load so you get artificially inflated results much much higher than they should be .
you can use a verbose flag on apachebench to see the output of the page you 're benchmarking against that not many people know to use this will ensure you 're benchmarking properly .

but even though it is n't needed it 's the best talent to use since you ca n't get enough damage out of hotw for it to be worth using on pull .
actually yeah i 've only had a couple matches but there 's two other guys in ib who are really into it .
not a bad place to call home i 'd say
there 's plenty of information on google and wiki and youtube
the way i 've always said and heard it said is 8 and 2 colorless '' or 2 and 2 blue '' or 1 and 3 red '' etc
generally if a number is n't followed by a color or colorless it 's understood to be generic .
and when it comes to mana produced by lands if it can produce both colorless and colored a la painlands tapping it and add 1 '' would be understood to be adding one colorless since nothing produces generic mana . ''
you think it would but i suspect a lot of the people who are bitching about it probably would n't believe a condition like that .
they 'd probably think she 's making it up or something .
there 's tons of conditions out there that people do n't believe in just because it 's not common or has no outward signs or whatever .
it 's like they 're afraid to even look it up and be proven wrong .
in your case i would run zoro so he gets boosted as a slasher .
there is a different team build for apoo but i do n't remember the required cd .
i think your best option would be to create the background colours you want as an image and set it as the backgroundf or the sheet .
you can then set all cells on the sheet to be filled with colour white or black or grey for the table and the ones in the table to have no-fill so the background comes through .
warning though you will probably have a fair bit of trial and error getting the cells and the background lined up to get the exact same table lay-out .

if it 's the front header inputs on the desktop make sure that 's hooked up correct since the gpu sound works it sounds like a hardware issue .
if it 's the front header and the back inputs than that 's odd .
with both not working it makes me think either windows re-install faulty default driver try uninstalling any and all audio drivers and then install the new one or some odd hardware issue .
except its a huge reason why csgo is so popular now .
if you think they 're reversing the skins economy and how it works then you 're deluded .

i have to tell them i 'm going to take hormones before i start with it .
that 's suuuuuper shitty ... wpath suggests including family members in the discussion for sake of examining strain on relationships etc .
they definitely do n't specify hey you have to out your patient to their entire family before hrt '' .
it does however say it is important for mental health professionals to recognize that decisions about hormones are
the criteria for hrt via informed consent from a sane provider are fairly unobtrusive ...
capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent for treatment yep .

if significant medical or mental health concerns are present they must be reasonably well controlled .
depending on where you live it 's entirely possible that there 's an informed consent clinic or trans-friendly doctor .

yes that 's a point but if you think it through than bitcoin already has failed .
unlike bitmessage bitcoin is not just '' sorry you know what i mean code it 's a storage of value and as such it needs to be connected to other storages of value like fiat money .

as a country we have n't properly region-locked first names so it 's indeed possible to give a south-holland-born baby a frysian name .
the south hollanders probably learned of the name by traveling or migrated frysians or perhaps one of the parents was from fryslan originally .
jelle sounds definitely frysian to my amsterdam-ears like all males named 'anne ' .

i wanted a little girl so badly and before the gender scan he was talking about how he thought it was going to be a girl .
im sorry ... it can be really hard ... my 6 year relationship/engagement ended a few months ago good terms and all but what we each wanted/needed for ourselves was just not compatible anymore and rather than cause more pain or worse for us to start resenting one another ... . there have been hard nights but it was a good relationship for both of us and we both evolved a lot thanks to it etc so i think that might be the way to look at it ?
like ... it was valuable regardless of what happens from here on out .
but you need to really examine how the future would play out and kinda make the judgment call in terms of what would cause the least amount of pain ...

as reporting the turkish paper milliyet '' http futbol.as.com/futbol/2016/01/07/primera/1452203104_127051.html says that galatasaray will offer 39m‚Ç¨ for sa√∫l √≥liver and carrasco carrasco 15 √≥liver 14 and sa√∫l 10 .
of course i doubt atleti would accept that but i wonder if any turkish user here could talk about how serious/reliable is that paper .

no human beings namely men put into an army fighting to the death with an enemy fully dehumanized in their minds .

tbh i think it is equally embarrassing that players still do n't adapt to rengar at all .
there are round about 5 point 5 fucking k topics about how to handle a fed rengar as adc '' and 5.4k of those recommend building an hourglass .
but nooo you cant its an ap item and it doesnt grant you damage ! ! !
when i play rengar in 99.999 of my games no-one does it .
they opt '' for their build they played the past 20 games .
zed players do n't build a qss vs rengar cause his cc is n't that good '' .
its like you are playing an ad version of lb .
happens in 1/200 games that midlaners actually build a no damage item first cause you need damage .
so many people in this game absolutely dont understand the concept that a defensive item is also an offensive item since you survive longer to deal damage .
but nope i want high numbers on my spells/auto attacks .
asides that at least in plat/dia most teams understood how to fuck rengar .
they start grouping early and asap they see the ! ''
no i am not talking about running as 5 over a lane '' i mean they start a fucking mosh pit where you ca n't target anyone properly as rengar .
that is how you have to play vs him and i.e .
but well rengar is only around since 2-3 years .
there is no way to figure out a counterplay to him .
i am looking forward for the reddit hate on talon and basically each and every ad champion if riot really wants to release their assassin item '' to help k6 cough .
i am also looking forward for the rengar nerfs '' or his 10th rework '' to figure out another way to kill the stupid adcs and apcs who refuse to build anything asides from damage .
edit looking forward for those down votes and pns filled with hate only took reddit 2 minutes for that .
edit 2 yeah an over all 51 win rate is way to broken for this game .
this should be top priority for riot to fix .
he needs his 48 back from preseason start ! !
i employ people in perth at a reasonable rate for difficult outdoor manual labour .
it 's hard enough getting decent laborers here without expecting them to travel to rural areas .
you clearly do n't really understand the logistics and difficulty of being a seasonal worker
i do which is why i wo n't sign up for it either .
i am just as lazy as the aussie workers that wo n't pick fruit either unless there is some serious coin in it .
i used to get 80k a year for sitting in an air conditioned security hut why would i pick fruit ?
you seem to agree that there is no easy solution .
growers ca n't raise their wages to meet aussie workers expectation and still make a profit .
atleast they lived a long life and died of old age .
these were the best photos i could take with my iphone and a little novelty magnifying glass .
i watched the cardinals-seahawks and steelers-seahawks games in for the same reason you did op .
palmer was successful passing it deep and the cardinals defense stopped the seahawks enough so that the cardinal offense came out on top .
cardinals played well on special teams and lockett did n't get any notable punt returns .
they also stopped the run fairly effectively and since the seahawks were behind most of the game they could expect them to pass most of the time .
carson palmer fumbled it 2 times in which the seahawks recovered and scored a touchdown but wilson was intercepted once as well .
the steelers also had a very effective deep passing attack .
the steelers were also good at getting pressure on wilson which is a great way to kill his effectiveness .
one of the reasons i think the steelers lost is because they often gave up long returns to lockett which set the seahawks up for good field position on every drive .
also roethlisberger threw 2 interception this game and the seahawks did not have a turnover if i recall correctly .
i think a deep passing attack will be very helpful in this game .
this is the most nervous part for me because teddy is n't very accurate on deeper throws .
i rewatched the rams-vikings game and noticed that there were multiple throws in which wr 's were open but teddy overthrew them .
we could have won that game by a couple touchdowns more than 21-18 .
getting pressure on wilson is very important as well because wilson is very good at passing and running .
if he gives the seahawks good field position they will probably put up a lot of points .
mainly i think our d-line has to play well to stop the run and pressure wilson and i think our o-line has to play well to give teddy time to throw and help peterson with running .
we also have one of the highest costs of living on the planet .
you ca n't just compare the income and go see '' .
i think gundogan bale and hazard would be an amazing transfer window for us .

the quote he was replying to is outdated anyway and not empirically correct .
he was just showing how foolish the quote is .
full source video if you 've got a couple minutes .
yes very much the ground shakes but the air is only very slightly affected and not to an extent that would affect an aircraft .
the affect on the air is significantly less than would be seen during regular in-flight turbulence .
in fact there are several aircraft which have landed during an earthquake during the tokyo 2011 quake one aircraft had just touched down and another was below the point at which it could safely abort the landing both landed and completed their landing run safely if uncomfortably .
the earth shaking is n't pleasant but even at it 's absolute worst it only '' moves a metre or two .
while this is n't ideal for an aircraft they 're landing at 130mph 60 metres per second anyway and often moving sideways by 1-2 metres per second too .
in short there 's virtually no danger during an earthquake to an aircraft and it 's safer than being on the ground .
even if you were on the ground though an aircraft would be a very safe place to be airplanes are generally parked out in the open in the middle of the ramp/apron with nothing to fall on them .
the plane itself is very structurally strong and is designed to handle the movement of turbulence .
in short it 's one of the safest places you could be .
my only issue with reigns it 's him being booked as an underdog the same thing as john cena .
if you are going to have the rock vs. reigns or reigns vs. lesnar ii make it about how they are two unstoppable monsters .
roman reigns should no more be booked as the underdog .
if they have specs for device they generally get the drivers .
most companies do n't provide the specs and they write their own crappy version of drivers which are generally not accepted by main tree for quality reasons .
i am not saying there are not some crappy drivers in main tree but getting a new crappy driver in there is much harder for a while now .
not that getting a crappy driver is ever a good idea .

he was streaming the whole time through it i think it was quite common in the early days .
afterwards he fired up battlefield 3 which was recently released at the time and just played some of that .
he even got recognized by a player on his team who asked him if he was the real wickd

but my understanding of fur vs leather is that animals are killed specifically for furs while leather is a byproduct of the food industry .
kill a cow for beef and use its hide for leather .
hence why most leathers are from cows lamb or goat and not other mammals .
although we all know there are alligator snake and ostrich skin goods for a price .
still i agree that vintage furs are not the same as modern ones the damage was done a long time ago .
too bad it fits her 4'10 '' body perfectly .
if it did n't end at mid-forearm i 'd let her pass it down to me in a hot second .
in doing more reading this morning i 've read that 1 some leather is a co-product of the meat industry where farmers will try to get every dollar they can out of an animal and that 2 in some places such as india leather is made from cows who are too old or ill to be used for meat and killed just for leather .
i 've also seen some sources saying that leather is worse for the environment and humans than fur as the tanning and dyeing of leather is incredibly toxic and most of this work is being moved to india or china who have more lax environmental standards .
definitely worth learning more about if you 're so inclined .

you downgrade with kloader which can run unsigned code on a userland level .
there are actually so much you can do with kloader at a low level including verbose boot and even dual booting .
also from personal experience i have always had success with odysseus .
i downgraded to 8.3 on my 4s with blobs and re-restore a 7.1.2 device by dumping onboard blobs and of course downgraded one of my 4s 's to 6.1.3 by fetching ota blobs .
could you give more detail about why you did n't like the new mac lipsticks ?
i think i put too much emphasis on the sex in my original post the lack of sex is an issue that i should work on but my main problem is that he feels that he has free access to my body .
we are two separate human beings and if i ask him to stop he should stop out of respect .
similarly when i go overboard on stroking his ears they are so soft !
he will tell me to stop which is fine because why should i be allowed to aggravate parts of his body just because it makes me feel good ?
for mark stroking me down there is not about trying to turn me on or initiate sex .
so it was stupid of him to bring up 'but what about our sex life ' when he knows damned well that this was nothing to do with sex it 's about respecting each other .
because the thing that bites people in the ass when they climb on a supersport without any riding experience is the brakes .
the stopping power they have is unlike anything you can imagine and it comes on more violently than you can conceive if you just honk down on the lever .
it 's extremely easy to send yourself over the handlebars if you do n't know what you 're doing .
dirt bike experience teaches you a lot about braking .
dirt bikes have very little braking power but on the dirt you have very little traction .
you learn how to be gentle you learn when to be rough you learn what it feels like when a front wheel slide is coming on you learn that a front wheel slide can be controlled after you learn the hard way that it 's something you generally want to avoid anyway .
without this finely-tuned appreciation of braking you are very likely to hurt yourself on a super sport .
it would be much better for you to start riding on a drz400sm .
they are n't as sexy as a cbr but they are a lot more forgiving and to be honest a whole lot more fun .
in my area the guys who are too old to fold themselves up on a supersport ride drzs and they have just as much fun anyway .
it 's more fun to ride a slow bike fast than to ride a fast bike slow .
it may seem automatic ... but a lot is going on ...
internally that 's a red light up there ... clutch in and roll ?
brake ? ... some combination of all depending on the situation . ''
i 've got a nice stretch of road here ... drive along in this gear ? ... downshift to speed up a little ? ... put it in neutral and roll along ? ... ''
oh i 'm stopped on a hill ... should i do an ebrake start ?
stop and go traffic ... first neutral first neutral first second ! neutral brake first neutral ... ''
i 'm doing 70 ... i guess i 'll use fifth now whoops ''

are there examples of these political ideologies outside of nazi germany ?
in what ways does national socialism differ from democratic socialism ?
for the record i in no way endorse national socialism or fascism .
i would just like to cultivate a broader understanding of these ideologies .
therefore a condition trades it with a good person most .
even in addition i want to trade it if there is good suggestion

substrate is eb 's cactus mix plus coarse sand .
over the last couple days i 've been puzzling about their growth .
the tap roots in several seem very long and skinny compared to the broad wide plant of the head .
the tap root on a few does n't seem to be aggressively penetrating the substrate .
just in the last day i 've noticed several have fallen over .
so i 've taken a spoon and sterile coarse sand and done my best to pour sand donuts '' around them and prop up those cumbersome tops .
i 've tried to picture one of the typical sprouts .
i 've never grown these before so i do n't know if these are normally shaped or not .
sorry no real reference for size but they 're about a week to 1 1/2 wks old .
i am trying to figure out how to do push notifications with the new apns provider api https developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/networkinginternet/conceptual/remotenotificationspg/chapters/apnsproviderapi.html .
my research so far has found me the curl_http_version_2_0 option for curl but i just do n't understand how to code some of the things that the api talks about .
which i thought meant it was an http/2 post to 3/device device-token but then the next thing says
apns requires the use of hpack header compression for http/2 which prevents repeated header keys and values .
to help avoid filling up the apns hpack table and necessitating the discarding of table data encode headers in the following way‚Äîespecially when sending a large number of streams
the path header should be encoded as a literal header field without indexing
i also have no idea how to keep the connection open send multiple posts on the connection and read the headers and responses .
i have n't been able to find any tutorials on the web about how to do any of this but once i figure it out i plan to write one !
just looking for people around the same skill level looking to have some fun and make it to the lighthouse .
hi guys i 'm currently conscripted in the army for the remaining term of 12 months !
i have access to the internet and want to improve my spoken chinese .
i keep debating whether or not the best way to go about this would just be to memorise tons and tons of sentences ...

hi i 'm really interested in building experience in this field but i ca n't come up with a cool enough project to start out with .
i 'm really big tea guy so i 'd like to do something that has to do with that .
after googling so far the best i 've found is an automatic tea steeper .
i 'm wondering if you guys happen to have a really cool idea for a project that has to do with tea in someway .
so first off i want to thank you for reading this if you are .
anyways i want to start a team/party where we have fun in halo 5 .
fun is obviously subjective so at times being competitive may be fun .
but for the most part i 'd like to start a team that just wants to have a good time over being really serious about the game .
so if you like to join just post your gamertag down in the comments below .
my gamertag is seatactics '' and i have a lot of free time right now .
i 'm also 20 so i 'm not a teenager who will yell at you .
i now have at least 140000000 experience points in the smithing skill .
with most girls in my college lecture hall that i 've struck up a conversation with they 'll never laugh when i talk with them .
how can i feel so much for such a brief exchange ?

honestly as a primarily solo player of rocket league the matchmaking is pretty bad .
i 'm decent by no means good nor bad .
i miss aerials and i make mistakes but honestly games that are evenly balanced rarely happen .
i have two matchmaking ideas which are shower thoughts which i believe could help rocket league 's matchmaking algorithm .
1 matchmaking based off aerial hits aerial goals and time spent in the air .
this one sounds pretty complicated but take for example me i have lots of time spent in the air a fair few aerial hits but very few aerial goals as my aerial attempts are usually do n't go near the goal .
somebody like kronovi however has a very very high amount of time spent in the air but also a ton of aerial hits and his conversion rate will be a lot lot higher than mine .
most games i play someone is just ridiculous at scoring aerials and quite frankly i should n't be matched with .
now i have a poor win rate something that comes with being a primary solo player .
yet i often i finish the top of my team or at least second not too far behind first .
i believe matchmaking could be done purely by win and score if people of similar win rates and score should be matched together so those that usually top a team are all playing together whilst those that are carried all play together .
i 've been depressed since i was 10 i 'm 20 now .
the past two years my depression has only gotten worse .
one of my closest friends died my mother gave away my cat without my permission and now my landlord is making me rehome my dog due to a change in his insurance .
i 'm realizing now how much i rely on my dog to help me feel better ...
i 'm not really asking for advice or help i just really need to tell somebody this shit because it 's all i 've thought about for two years now except for the past week as i 've been agonizing over rehoming my best friend .
i hope everyone in this sub is staying strong through whatever they 're suffering over .
i complained about not being able to safely take my nice knives anywhere for me and for the knives so my side made me a custom knife roll designed to perfectly hold all 8 of my henkels .
she could n't find any designs to do it so she winged it and turned out great .
she made this in 2010 and i use it almost monthly .
i 'm not a pro just a guy that likes to do a lot of cooking .
i use this thing monthly year round and heavy use during football season .
so i have no idea about slaughter so would be great if someone could help me out !
i signed my 16 year old son up for skating lessons .
he ultimately wants to play hockey and one of his buddies that plays is eager for them to get on the ice together .
he 's roller bladed a couple of times but nothing on ice yet .
i signed him up for a beginning 6-16 yrs beginning class .
he 's the oldest and the biggest by a long shot but he did great .
after class we were talking about it and i asked if he wanted me to see if we can switch him to an adult class .
he said no and that he 'll stay where he is .
i said that i wished he would have been interested when he was younger .
he tells me that he was and that it was one of the first sports he asked me to do .
he said that you did n't want my teeth getting knocked out .
i 'm listening to this and hearing my nmom coming out of me .
he shrugged his shoulders and said it 's ok .
when we were almost home i said no really i 'm truly sorry .
i said no it is n't it 's a cycle that should have been broken a long time ago and i 'm sorry .
i also told him that this is still possible for him to do he 'll just have to practice a lot once he gets the basics down .
one of my biggest complaints growing up in my nfamily was not being listened to so i totally understand how he 's feeling and i 'm kicking myself for it .
i 'm in some pain right now for the pain i 've caused him .
i do n't want him thinking that it 's a false apology and that i 'm just going to blow him off when he comes to me for something .
i am thinking about the nike vapor but any suggestions would be helpful .
they appear to have a wingtip design and appear to be a boot
i asked him if he would like to draw my groups characters for their first game i 'm the dm and he accepted .
although the attributes of the characters are highly exaggerated i think he did a great job with it .
i was watching an episode of this well my wife was and i was listening .
i heard something insanely familiar looked up and had to look up the main character on imdb it was so familliar .
it was so weird once i ided why i recognized the voice he says a lot of stuff that cole would say .
he 's a british vicar who assists in murder investigations .
i feel like it represents what cole becomes if you encourage him to become human .

trying to sign up for programs for my twins and not very clear what these two entail i 've read the pamphlets and done some googling but still feeling a bit lost .
i get that ibi is for intense more hours and more focused than aba but what kinds of things to these programs do to help .
all i 'm reading is generic each is geared towards your children 's personal needs .
sure that 's great sounding but what do they do with kid typically ?
i realize every one is going to have different experience with these i 'm just looking for a bit more information from those who have gone through it themselves as parent or participant so i can help decide what seems best for my kids .
the developmental pediatrician who diagnosed the twins was encouraging to sign up for both as the wait list for ibi in the area is about 3 years currently and 6 months for aba and then decide later .
but i really do n't want to put my kids through more exams and interviews without really knowing what these programs are going to do with them in more detail .
so i need help from the all-mighty reddit investigators.. help me find kfo 's na account d would be very greatful !

this morning when i woke up i saw that my friend sent me and our group of friends a message saying that he 'll see us in the next life and that he has a note for us if something does happen .
i feel really lost because me and my group of friends want to help him yet we think that he 's already accepted it .
we 're not really sure what has happened to him since he hangs out with other people but he 's still one of our close friends .
he does n't want this getting out of our group but i do n't think there 's any other way that i could get help .

how did i get seemingly reincarnated into a dating game ?
because it was a dating game i thought i 'd go capture heroines and do kya~kya~ufufu things but i was born as a girl .

i have a martian notifier watch which i love because it looks like a regular watch but gives basic notification info on a scrolling screen .
the android app lets you set any app 's notifications to go to the watch thing is that none of the alarm apps i 've found preferably one that can also go off in silent mode actually trigger a notification when they go off the same way say hangouts or gmail does with a new message .
or maybe an alternative like using ifttt or tasker neither of which i have any experience with ?

i was wondering if there was a way to change the steam client browser to run off of chrome so i can use chrome extensions in steam .

has anyone been able to modify the steam client in any way like this ?
slashing with sword is done even with straight-edged double-edged swords seen in many different places in the world including the ancient rome without any curve not to mention a straight-backed kitchen knife cutting food .
it is false that a big curve is needed for slashing .
muyedobotongji recorded even traditional korean sword sports has such such including beheading was always recorded .
also korean hwando the original katana before japan was n't all straight-backed even koryeo era 1000 years ago had slight curves .
there was a variety in hwando was compared to chinese curved hoingdo in koryeo era they were all used .
i 'm insanely into rush and want to know if there 's a fact i 've yet to know
that was a much longer expedition than i initially estimated ... and i still have one more leg of the journey to complete .
turns out zuben-el-schemali is only one of five systems sharing a similar name structure .
galnet reference sources attribute the names to ancient terran arabic referring to the stars in the constellation libra as seen from earth .
apparently some cultures saw the shape of a scorpion in the stars here .
so everyone knows rule 1 of flying never fly what you ca n't rebuy .
another good rule to follow is never attempt to scoop rare commodities floating alone in the black .
i should have known it was a trap but i did it anyway and the pirate in an anaconda saw to it that i spent the second half of my trip so far in near-absolute paranoia .
but on the bright side i found my first water world !
someone had already logged the discovery with uc but it was pretty cool to see anyway .
i 'm just about restocked with supplies and the pad rats here in chiccan are just about done with repairs .
time to go back out into the black this time with a route over 500 ly out .
if i survive it 'll be the furthest i 've ever been out of inhabited space .
once i get to the base of the scorpion 's tail i 'll take stock of supplies .
dunno if i 'll come straight back to the bubble though .
the canonn institute out in the pleiades nebula just put out a story on galnet about barnacles or some-such .
i might head out there next and see if i can help out their orbital station somehow .
i just hope i wo n't have to think about outfitting my type 6 for long-distance survival on top of maximizing cargo space .
we are deeply sorry for our previous actions towards you . ''
said the tsar in a recent press release we hope that it is all seen as water under the bridge now .
we are honored to be a part of the eto and we are glad to have you as an ally now . ''
i have created a playlist of .pls files for online stations and i want to be able to jump to that whenever and selecting a station to play but all the files in this are being replaced by whatever i played last so that might be a single folder i selected from the artist list or it might be the whole collection .
basing buyout on others i 've seen listed but negotiable etc ...
i 'll exhaust all dialog options and they 'll only say you showed up in the nick of time '' am i glad you 're on our side '' and i ca n't give them things to fight monsters like the deathclaw that abruptly showed up in my settler .

tl dr tbilisi is our new capital we spend 30,000 ducats to rebuild the damage to narikala and generally help people recover from the attack
god truly favored tbilisi for she was largely spared of destruction during the imeretian invasion .
she would continue to reign as the crown-jewel of the caucasus and in king bagrat 's hands it was only a matter of time until all georgia recognized his rightful kingship .
the king would have liked nothing more than to march to kakheti to finish the business right then and there but unfortunately he had to attend to rebuilding the city .
narikala fortress would be rebuilt and restocked the cross on the church of st. nicholas put back up and the surrendered soldiers reintegrated into society .
furthermore in exchange for providing quarter and provisions and to gain some loyalty some 30,000 ducats will be parceled out .
half of it will be for those who we owe the other half to ease tbilisi 's integration by making some happy peasants .
more importantly the king ordered his servants in imereti 's capital of kutaisi to bring his riches his regalia his horses and everything he needed to tbilisi .
he was fond of kutaisi but this city was the only one fit for a king of a unified georgia .
from now until his death this was his home and in due time this was where he would march forth to kakheti solidifying once and for all the georgian crown .

i was very active in this community a while back .
i did reality checks everyday and i wrote in my dream journal every chance i could .
i was having lds regularly but i did n't focus completely and lost lucidity slowly/my mind was too foggy to think normally most of the time .
the reason why i quit is because i kind of got bored of doing reality checks got more busy in life and i lost my dream journal .
i also have n't lucid dreamed in a week or two prior to quitting .
so one day i just stopped doing reality checks/dream journaling .
strangely enough after quitting and not having lucid dreams for weeks i had one nearly every night .
as it progressively got worse i used to remember having lucid dreams but i only could remember the moment of lucidity .
and now i can not remember a single dream and when i do it 's usually a 3 second snippet .
and worst of all i can not improve my dream recall because i can never remember a dream to write down .
i have been trying to write my dreams down for 3-5 days now but i ca n't remember a single one !
so anyways i found my dream journal and i am ready to start ld'ing again to better hone the skill .
i remember when i first started dream journaling in the very beginning my dream recall improved drastically after writing down the first dream i barely remembered .
i went from only remembering snippets of dreams for months to remembering what seemed like nearly full fledged tv show length dreams only after 1 2 days of writing down my dreams .
and it got better and better to the point where it was like living an alternate life at night .
so here i am now ready to start again .
mostly looking to get my hands on a howl but i will consider most knives send to me trade offer

with her librarian style of dress glasses and quiet nature few would suspect the depraved guilt-inducing thoughts that run around in her head .
so much so that concern of a coffee-cup sized wet spot forming as she soaks through her panties and skirt is a real concern if she lets her mind wander too long .
she caries at least two pairs of panties in her purse .
few would recognize the connection between her pen-chewing habit and a more salacious oral fixation a mental fixation on gagging on cock .
she takes great length to hide the contents of her kindle she always carries around .
she 'll tell people it 's the classics or poetry but it 's mostly filled with stories of depraved erotica .
she commonly walks around the office/library/hallways with a butt plug deep inside her and she wonders what it would feel like to have a hot load of come shooting into her ass .
most do n't make the connection between the choker she sometimes wears as a manifestation of a longing desire to have someone put a collar on her and lead her around on a leash .
not many deduce that the reason she her decidedly un-archtype behavior of occasionally smoking a cigarette behind the library is the desperate hope that someone will bend her over their knee and spank her as punishment .
few notice that she always wears stockings and a garter instead of leggings or pantyhose because she enjoys feeling bare inner thigh as she goes about her day thinking about how easy it would be to discretely service a cock .
she longs to feel come dripping down her thighs as she goes about her day .
she has a sharp mind but she longs to serve .
hi i just installed a new wifi card gigabyte bluetooth 4.0/wifi expansion card components gc-wb867d-i and drivers .
my computer now restarts about 5 seconds after shutting down .
additionally my usb ports are now powered when the computer is shut down .
i have a custom desktop pc running windows 10 asock z97 killer mother board .
it was working fine prior to installing the card .
i have tried searching for help with this problem .
one suggestion was to uninstall gigabyte on/off that does not appear to be installed on my computer .
additionally it was suggested to adjust the power management options to make sure that none of the hardware would be allowed to turn on the computer .
further i adjusted the registry as show in this video https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=fmgwq_s5psa which was also suggested as one way to fix this problem .
i also checked the bios and did not see anything that was obvious that needed adjusting .
i 've been playing a game recently and one of my teammate was laming so hard stealing sheep boar killing deer walling resources and on the top of that he was flaming in all chat some random you '' and more .
and the target was actually the guy with the lowest elo .
i was n't aware that people could be so horrible on this game i felt so bad for the enemy team that i walled off my teammate for being such a dick .
how do you feel when you are playing with/against people like ?
the video went on by the lines of mi hermano es un pelotudo '' my brother is stupid and it kind of showed you an ugly animation of two mans .
there was one which was predominantly speaking about nonsense/wrong things all the time while you can saw real images in the background of places of argentina i think .
i remember i found it searching something like hermanos pelicula argentina '' argentinan brothers movie .
that time i searched it on youtube for smart tv which has different results from the web version .
i think it was like 00:30 or 01:00 minute long .

when i do a sysprep for a win10x64 enterprise v.1511 current branch image and then do an os deployment in sccm the windows store and other provisioned apps go unregistered and i can not repair nor reinstall them .
this is not a problem with windows 8.1 or windows 10 enterprise rtm .
should i unregister all of the provisioned apps before sysprepping the os ?
restarting my internet restarting computer even uninstall reinstall etc etc..
i am not a cryptography geek but is n't md5 completely insecure ?
may it is n't in the way they use it for their api .
can anyone confirm and explain why or why not ?
i assume that this sub is filled with hardcore ds fans especially that souls games are n't exactly new '' .
but it 's always nice to have some thoughts of someone who is completely new so here it goes .
first i have to say that i play games for a long time since early 90 's .
i 'm casual and i was never good at manual skills more like hilariously bad i played games more for story dialogs and so on and for this reason i always preferred turn-based combat or something with pause like baldur 's gate .
i tried dark souls when it was released on pc and after playing through intro i was absolutely stunned how such piece of crap can be praised so much .
everything in this game was like made in 1997 terrible graphics hilarious camera work terrible controls not to mention i were killed by asylum demon 6 times in a row .
i found the game horrible thing for some masochist hipsters deleted it and forgot about it .
few days ago i was looking for something i can play after finishing fallout 4 and i noticed that darks souls 2 sotfs was super cheap .
it was like eh what 's the worst that can happen it 's so cheap it 's not even a risk '' .
once again pretty bad graphics clunky controls weird setting etc .
but i had nothing to do this day so i played along .
then killed by next skeleton then i jumped off the cliff by mistake and then i was killed by skeletons few more times .
yeah as you might think i suck at this kind of games .
i tested the game it was still sucking balls and that 's it .
few hours passed and i was like ... ok it 's bad game but to be stomped by trash mobs right after tutorial ?
so i tried once more i got little further but got fucked hard like 20 times in the process got frustrated turn off the game verdict complete trash .
and weird enough hour later i turned it on again .
why do i keep turning this awful game on ?
so i thought waaaaait let 's try the first one again .
i tried and it was as bad as i recalled and graphics became even worse .
so yeah tutorial getting killed by asylum demon and so on .
but i managed to beat him somehow and proceed ahead .
right now i 'm still at the beginning i killed some big-ass metal boar .
maybe i would be farther but i started new game few times trying to find starting class that fits my style of playing and going with melee wanderer as i like speed and knight in the heavy armor was so goddamn slow and could n't roll shit .
are stack in 90 's camera work is bad story is ... weird and close to nonexistent at the start you are undead go ring some bells done .
there are almost no npc at all and even if i find one it 's completely not interesting zero dialogs zero side quests .
this game is stuck in the old days for good and bad .
i like that fight is hard challenging and that everything can kill you and will kill you if you make any mistake .
i like that you lose souls upon death and have to reclaim them .
what i do n't like is full respawn on death .
for people like me who falls into every hole roll off every cliff and roof this is absolutely frustrating .
and hardcore take on exploration no map whatsoever no minimap no quest arows etc can be intimidating to player raised on new games .
like luring enemies one by one taking advantage of nonexistent ai no patrols no alarms etc .
hoping that your opponent get stuck in some place or fall of the ramp etc .
i remember these things from a lot of old games .
what is really really weird and it 's honestly the first time in my personal history of gaming that i fell like some game is bad and i should really play something good instead i ca n't .
i ca n't because all i can think of is this game .
i get frustrated turn this off and in a while i 'm back and the cycle repeats .
and later i turn something really great like witcher 3 play for half an hour and looking at this magnificient piece of gaming art all i can think of is how to kill this freaking black knight do i roll do i block or maybe run and throw some bombs at him .
i feel like falling in love with this bad '' game and every good '' game now seems boring and uninteresting .
oh and i know i 'm at very beginning of both games but i feel that ds is slightly easier than ds2 sotfs .
and as i tried to restrain from any walkthroughs and guides i 'll probably end with super bad character and miss a lot of things .
in fact i may broke my game on this point because i killed some zombie merchant by accident who i 'm sure i 'm not supposed to kill .
but it dropped me some fun katana so at least i have that
just wanted to share my weird fascination with this game .
oh and sorry for my english i 'm not native speaker and i was struggling writing this a lot
i have trust issues with my girlfriend and it 's keeping me up at night .
i was dating this girl my now ex for a long time and we were all part of this friend group .
there was this girl in the friend group my current gf who was really good friends with my ex and i always kinda thought about her but never anything sexual or serious because it was n't my place since i was in a relationship .
when me and my now ex-gf broke up me and this girl decided albeit drunkenly to explore this possible relationship i think you know what that means .
now this was pretty controversial because my ex-gf explicitly asked her not to do anything with me after we split up .
me and my current gf kept it a secret because we did n't want to hurt my ex/her friend .
the ex-gf ended up moving to a different country and was so far away that my current gf and i decided to reveal our relationship to the rest of the friend group .
now 's probably a good time to state that i felt like shit the whole time doing this knowing how much it would hurt my ex and break the girl code '' for getting with a friends ex or whatever .
but i truly loved my current gf and had known her for years at this point i had to know what it was like .
now here 's the trust issues when my ex-gf and i broke up and then my current gf and i hooked up me and my current gf decided we should n't be together romantically again until my ex left the country .
i understood and we both agreed to it and both agreed we wanted to be with each other afterwards .
i then leave town for a month on business and while i 'm out of town my ex-gf moves out of my place .
during this time i have sufficient reason to believe my current gf hooked up with another guy unsure how many times but positive they hung out and positive they had sex .
it hurts to think about and it hurts to type .
but we were n't dating at that time so technically she did nothing wrong .
here 's the kicker the guy she hooked up with has a long term gf .
i confronted her about it and she denied anything happening .
i do n't have concrete evidence it happened but i have so many clues and hints that i would be extremely surprised if it did n't happen .
my reason for having trust issues now is that she hooked up with me against her friends will and she hooked up with this guy when he was in a serious relationship .
i ca n't help thinking she does n't have any respect for what being in a relationship means but at the same time she was n't in a relationship during these events just affected other peoples relationships .
not to mention she lied to me about it .
i love her and i want to trust her but i lay in bed thinking about it and ca n't get it out of my mind .
i want to tell her about it and bring it up but i do n't want to seem paranoid or insecure .
my current gf and i are in a great and loving relationship .
the guy she hooked up with moved away and everything is great .
except for that voice in the back of my head .
tl dr girlfriend was an accessory to bad juju and unsure if that means she 's untrustworthy or if i 'm just being paranoid .

i 'm still pre-everything so this is n't immediately relevant anyway but i 'm not sure if i like the idea of wearing makeup all the time .
not to make a judgement on it i just do n't think it 's my style .
have any of you decided to transition without makeup and if so how did that go for you ?

i was wondering about the worth of buffs granted by neutral jungle monsters when using smite .
for example i always try to smite raptors and gromp before a gank or a teamfight .
and while smiting raptors seems really useful to deny vision/putting pressure on a lane opponent i was wondering if the gromp buff is really worth it ?
1 is the gromp 's buff generally really worth a smite ?
2 should junglers running skirmishers/stalkers blade keep their spell to smite opponents because the damage/slow is a better option than the gromp 's buff ?
3 i always wondered about the krug 's buff it seems useful for early jungle clears but it seems to lose its interest as the game goes on .
smiting wolves red and blue buff seems situationnal to me so i do n't really have questions about them but if you have nice not well known tips on them i 'll gratefully take those

a few days ago i bought some new disks and thought that i would redo my storage solution .
i decided to install omnios with napp-it and i 've now set up a raid-z2 over six hgst 4tb deskstar nas drives .
but when i transfer over my old files to the server again i 'm only getting about 60mb/s write and 30mb/s read at best no matter if it 's smb nfs or iscsi .
i 've tried doing some os tcp tweaking which did n't do anything for me and i 've also tried turning off zfs sync which also did nothing for me .
i do n't think it 's the array that 's be bottleneck because when doing the different benchmarks that 's included with napp-it i get at least 300mb/s for both read and write .
previously i ran four drives of the same model in a raid-z1 but instead on omnios it ran on freebsd and on that setup i got better performance even though the raid-z1 was unoptimal configured .
i 've found some other people on google that seemed to have the same problem as me with the same numbers but it did n't seem like they found a solution .

in france the ' jesuisx ' has been used a bit before the 7/01/2015 and the charlie hebdo thing .

it 's one of the worse maps for rift .
the only one worse might be vertigo and that 's only because of the teleport gate .
if it 's one-sided rift is n't a single flag ctf game .
it 's a trap the enemy in their spawn and kill them as they come out game .
at least in control if a team pushes too far forward it might flip the spawns .
hell if i 'm ever lucky enough to get out i usually end up getting team shot because i 'm by myself .
that 's even before considering having a team coordinated enough to be able to push through one specific area .
on cathedral it feels like it always ends up with just that which means the game is one-sided .
saying it 's one of the most fun maps for rift is like saying you enjoyed thorn because it got you kills .

my main issue with mmp is that it 's a combination of two systems i 'm not a huge fan of fptp and party list pr though combined they are much better than each individually .
both result in wasted votes fptp elects without majority support and most implementations of party list pr place too much control in the hands of parties and disadvantage minor parties that do n't reach the threshold and the ones that do n't waste votes anyway .
irv and stv the two components of preferential mmp address all of these issues .
preferential voting eliminates the wasting of votes ensures majority support for the winner and stv allows the voters rather than the parties to control who is elected .
even if obama invited her in person to the white house to convince her to go to this rally it is still completely unacceptable to be treated in such a way .
what you can see on this rally is hatred and racism in its purest form .
that would require fighting against those who implemented the draft and the war that led to it .
an abundance of volunteers just makes unnecessary and unjust military action easier and more politically expedient .

yeah the attack stat would be necessary please but that 's what i wanted to change all three 31 attack stats to 0 attack i just changed them
my idea is i want to hatch the pokemon and be able to easily see which stat of the 6 did n't get passed down that 's why i choose 31/**31**/31/30/31/30 for hp fire 31/**30**/31/30/31/30 because that way if the judge tells me that the attack stat is perfect i would know it was passed down and something else was not
that 's also why i choose the name not hot '' because i would use it to breed hp fire although it 's hp water
but i just realized that he also tells me that the attack stat is terrible 0 or 1 and that 's why i 'm now going with 31/**0**/31/30/31/30
i just changed it i think i 'll keep the nicknames though p

the alternative is that the cup is too large i think it is worth trying lucy in 32e to be sure you look like you could go down a couple of mm in wire width and obviously going to a smaller size is likely to do that wire widths are listed on bratabase.com which can be a help to stop you ordering something clearly unsuitable .
if you do have tall roots entirely possible half cups can be a good shape freya has starlet unlined half cup that is narrowish and projected lauren padded half cup and clones that are wider but have some projection then patsy and clones which in most sizes are wide and shallow though in your size range it 's not super wide by any means .
is n't this true of trans people in general and not just veterans ?
i doubt they were friends before boogie got famous though
i 'm not convinced game matters not when it comes to hitting on strangers or looking for ons .
i think that it can have some minimal influence but looks are the primary arbiter of attractiveness followed by socio-economic status followed by 'game ' or what i would just call social skills .
those numbers seem off but i think i can deduce which one 's you 're referring to .
first i have yet to successfully cast a spell but one day i shall be a great wizard ... erm i mean i could n't bestow upon you my gifts for it would break the ancient code of ... . ferrantulius

third i think it is awesome but people keep telling me to be quiet as if i had raised my voice

voters remain closely divided on the need for additional gun control .
forty-five percent 45 believe the united states needs stricter gun control laws but 50 disagree .
to hear gun-control advocates tell it 94.78 of americans want stricter gun control .
the 45-55 number has stayed pretty flat throughout the years .
contrary to the propaganda there is no rallying cry among the public to hamper gun ownership .
good half abit wasteful in last few chances i think we ll score at least once in 2nd half and lucho will start resting players probably seeing sandro play and others
oh no i 'm just showing you ridiculous player names .
i agree both are bad but from what i know takata did not go to the same level of ignoring the problem once they knew about it then covered it up like gm did for years .
of course the airbag failure failure is obvious unlike an ignition switch which might not be discovered in an accident investigation .
gm knew that and thought they would literally get away with murder .
just get a chase freedom if you do n't have one already .
fifteen months no interest and a signup bonus worth 150 at the moment .
if you 've got a lot of other wedding expenses and can meet the 4,000 in three month minimum spend on the chase sapphire preferred then you can get that card also and your 150 cash can easily become worth twice that in flights for your honeymoon .
the sapphire 's bonus is worth 500 in cash but yet again easily double that if converted to airline miles .
i bring it up because the freedom ca n't transfer to miles but it can transfer to the sapphire which can then transfer .
if it 's not obvious i 'm planning a wedding too .
i 'm going to get 4,000 worth of flying for about 500 .
people do n't really tend to have big rings .

you seem to be blaming her and not at all him .
it sites that they were playing with a gun .
this is just as much his fault as it is hers .
i 'd charge her with unintentional manslaughter and give her an 18 month sentence .
fuck yeah but you could chalk it up as them not fully blaming her but also him .
you also seem to be hating women a bit too much to the point where its blinding your view on how they verify this .

i understand your frustration however it seems like your so for whatever reason is n't ready/mature enough to be there for you emotionally when you need him to .
maybe it 's his own insecurity/jealousy/immaturity/etc that he can put your well being above all that .
or most likely he simply do n't know how to emotionally support someone .
through a few failed relationships i 've finally learned that i do n't need to fix '' everything i simply just need to be there emotionally through a phone call or text .

it is not hard to see the corruption here come on .
for every one thing clinton tells us there are a hundred things she is not telling us .

this corruption problem needs to be fixed before anything else .
it 's not a rip off of a new hope it 's a tribute to all the films that came before .

i do n't oppose free movement within the commonwealth i think we should have a similar agreement with those nations but that does n't mean eu movement is bad .
in fact uk is one of the winners in eu immigration overall while places like poland are losing skilled labour to places like the uk and germany .
this is why our economy is projected to overtake france and the 2nd economy of europe by 2030 .
also you 'll find that if commonwealth immigration was opened up it might lead to a net loss for the uk with more brits moving to places like canada australia and new zealand than those nationalities coming here .
the only reason people hate eu immigration really is because they think that british born people deserve jobs over polish workers despite the fact that the polish worker is equally or more capable of doing the job .
they also make the mistake of thinking we have a finite number of jobs and that never changes in fact immigration is big factor in economic growth which means those poles are actually creating demand by moving here .
i do n't put any significance on nationality but solely on a economy and it makes sense economically to allow movement within the eu .
i can understand why people might not like large scale immigration of people who come from vastly different cultures and third world countries but frankly i feel like it makes no difference whatsoever if an immigrant is polish or canadian in fact in many ways we have more in common culturally with other europeans than we do with commonwealth peoples .
we seem to forget that the uk is part of europe and share all that culturally comes with it with other european nations distant places like australia despite once being part of our empire and speaking are language do not share that .

narratively i think fallout 4 failed as a rpg .
every branch in the dialog tree lead to the same result just slightly different dialog options .
in previous fallout games especially fallout 2 dialog options influence gameplay and how you 'll complete a quest .
you can say fuck you and your minutemen preston '' and he will just laugh it off and you 'll still have to do the quest .
there are a couple of good moments where certain someone in a certain faction is n't the person who says he is .
they send you out to kill him and you can make the choice to kill him or not .
but these moments are too few for a fallout game .
3 of the factions have the same ending almost verbatim just different dialog text and characters .
now that being said i think fallout 4 shines as a rpg in the combat department .
in the previous fallout games excluding first 2 there is a clear optimal path small guns .
energy weapons do n't appear until very late in the game unless you 're doing some hardcore early game exploring .
sneak is only useful in a couple of scenarios where going in blazing will work just as fine .
fallout 4 had a good balance between explosives small guns heavy weapons and energy weapons .
i found perks much more useless in the previous games .
strong back and nerves of steel insane requirements are really the only good all around perks in new vegas .
the other perks are very specific to a scenario that you may or may not encounter in the game .
i found perks to be all around useful in fallout 4 and applied to many scenarios .
the capital wasteland and the mojave desert had a certain style that kept me glued in the game .
dc felt like a true apocolyptic wasteland with radiation leaking everywhere .
the mojave felt like hopeless barren desert filled with a strong variety of civilizations .
the boston commons well felt like a bunch of empty buildings .
kind of like the liberty city of fallout games .
there are really only 2 major cities diamond city and goodneighbor .
there are settlements but settlements lack things a city needs .
you have to build your own shops and recruit your own settlers .
that is fun and all but i would like the developer not leave most of the design work to the players .
i would rather have a well designed world building over a fleshed out settlement building system .
i am not a big fan of questing in fallout 4 either .
i prefer most of my quests to be designed and not procedurally generated fetch quest .
i could n't tell whether if a quest handed to me is design or procedurally generated most of the time which goes to show how devs put so little effort into questing .
civex or civilizationexperiment is a semi-vanilla survival minecraft server where groups of players form roleplaying nations .
the map and ore generation are custom in order to make each biome unique with specific goods that can only be acquired there .
nations place claims on sections of land and cultivate that land as they please .
as time moves on alliances are formed wars are fought and friendships are made and occasionally lost .
civex aims to recreate real world politics diplomacy and conflict .
the server is more than a year old with a long lasting reddit community .
a basic beginners guide can be found here https www.reddit.com/r/civilizatonexperiment/wiki/guide .

i 've worked in a related industry with pcbs and really appreciate the work you do .
most of the linux distributions you listed are targeted at more experienced users .
manjaro is slightly more so but still is n't really a good beginner distro it 's more like arch for people who want to do less setup work .
you would probably be better off using something like linux mint or openmandriva both are aimed at people getting into linux so if you do n't know what to choose choose one of those .

the difficulty with online dating is that although ostensibly you may have made the physical cut in reality what can you tell from a photograph ?

i do n't know about finding 5s attractive one person 's 5 is another person 's 7 !
i 'm in decent shape not bad looking intelligent make good money ... i would like someone who 's reasonably slim reasonably attractive reasonably intelligent and solvent .

first if you care too much about her avatar you will have a much much more difficult time .

we 're saying it happens whether or not refugees are involved .
but thats not true 50 of those arrested now were recent refugees .
are you claiming that if they hadnt been there someone else would have taken their places ?
these events will happen more often if we do n't think scientifically about the causes .
thats what being done but culture is part of the cause here .
i think for example that extended families should be re-assembled across the european borders .
why wouldnt they ask asylum in the country the family is in ?
i would actually plead for the reverse dont let refugees choose but randomly distribute them troughout the eu .
you can keep familys grouped in this way if you want .
something to restructure the social fabric and bring social control mechanisms back .
thats not going to happen with such limited actions an aunt in munich wouldnt have stopped anything even a 1000 in germany wouldnt have done that .

its bs it start by shaming some who spoke out against such violence it then makes up a bs statement that this kind of talk has been going on for decades .
it continues with more nonsense that its just because these people are immigrants that the media reports on this .
ignoring the fact the media didnt write about it for almost a week and then tries to prove this by saying nobody cares when this happens on octoberfest .
yet the organisation itself has already long ago taken measures and it ignores the fact its a thousands times as big/a lot longer and involves ten times less vicitims .
it also is intellectually dishonest by comparing all arrest in oktoberfest with just sexually assault in munich

i managed to put the spacedocker on a hill and call from far down the explosion was really close but no impact or effect was noticed .
edit very difficult to hit a police heli with it
just plan to hang out in bed and take pain meds and netflix binge !
i 'm buying like that as well on some and riding the wave on others .
i 'd definitely bump the ram to 16gb even with the smaller hard drives in that case

deixo aqui dois bons artigos feitos pela comunidade do digitalocean com boas dicas .
a t√≠tulo de curiosidade este ano 2015 houve uma palestra sobre o yunohost no 32c3 internet cube let 's build together a free neutral and decentralized internet https media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7401-internet_cube
you could take the rodents somewhere to release them .
how many of them will come back to your place because they know food is there ?
how many find homes in other people 's places ?
but if you are willing to maintain that game then by all means release them elsewhere if you can .
if you drive is it worth the wasted fuel and additional pollution ?
if you live in a city do you want to give those pests a new home in a neighbor 's '' house ?
that is n't very nice after all rodents can spread disease eat your food contaminate your food and shit piss in your house .
sometimes they even cause damage like chewing wires this can cause fires or putting holes in things entrances for other potential pests .
humans are animals and connected to the ecosystems just as any other animal .
this means that we compete for food like other animals .
some animals kill for that competition whether it is mating territory or as food .
if you grew enough food to last the winter and to plant the next spring you would defend it because your life and the lives of your family depend on it .
if you are a farmer those rodents might contaminate the food barley grains alfalfa etc .
you need to keep your livestock alive through the winter .
humans are not very different than any other animal when it comes to competing for food .
what if there is an overpopulation of rats/mice in your area ?
this means that when the food sources run out many will starve to death a few turn to cannibalism .
i would rather peacefully drown than starve to death .
relocating rodents in an already overpopulated area does n't contribute much .
i thought it was great but only made it one season .
if your choir was anything like mine it 's because you were the only one who knew what they were doing and you had to pull the weight of three dozen other people lol .
for juice artificial flavors are cheaper and yield a higher profit margin .
for soap they utilize the acids in lemons to help clean also the same jug of soap is around 5x the cost of artificially made juices .
the problem is you are lumping in 'the subs ' with anything to do with the actual events in the outside world as if they are on the same footing rather than just being echo chambers of idiots .
similarly with the media vs the mayor and police .
they interact on some level but mostly do n't really have anything to do with one another actions they take are n't related .
that 's why i 'm calling it conspiracy nonsense .
the best way of thinking about art history is a chain of logical leaps .
artists always trying to find the next thing and branching off the last .
after photography art was trying to distill itself down to something basic so
impressionism took away the photo realism and left it to photography and focused more on the air colour and aura
neo-impression stripped paintings of their ether to capturing the real colours of things and the real aura of a scene they will make a scene with the colours they like and make the aura they like .
expressionism goes one step further breaking from representing the real world at all instead it 's primary focus is the expression of the aura
cubism sees the break from reality and tries to see if it can capture more of the world without looking like the world in only the way a painter can .
futurism thinks that it can capture movement better than cubism and things it 's a little tightly wound .
purism says fuck representing the real world again and decides just to use it to inspire the elements of art that it actually cares about .
abstract does even want to use the real world as an explanation .
it does the one thing photography ca n't or so they thought at that time exist as purely an element of design and art concepts .
from there it just gets more confusing as many painters declared painting dead as a practice but could never quite leave it be so we have everything start to swing back the other way .
the playstation 2 is like 15 years old meaning op is using a 7 year old meme
now while tall runners have an extremely large stride length their strides per second usually suffers .
usain bolt is the exception to this and you can see this when you compare him to other athletes .
i mean if i had a verified account and was known to be of the kind of caliber nero is i would n't be surprised for the verified tag to be removed .
you 'd think after being suspended several times he 'd learn but i guess some people are just ... well ... https 45.media.tumblr.com/7feab0d69ad8f9dc2ba557e6e5521ae6/tumblr_nuf2sqyfid1rjgdvwo1_500.gif
did you even read my post before you spat out a response ?
if you did you would have realized i already said there is no convincing someone like you and to do your own research .
there are translators who have cited that your interpretation is incorrect not that you would ever accept an idea that is contrary to your world view .
either that or you did read my post and just have a lack of basic reading comprehension .
in which case i would suggest you become a bit more proficient in your own language before you start analyzing others .
yes i 've been looking for the episode and for clips on yt .
then came back to comment sections hoping somebody would link .
lsb clips and episodes are one of my go-to cheer up yt videos
such a small selection of westerns are available on netflix .
i would think there would be more because some of the older ones have to be fairly cheap .
for myself i 'm going to check out blackthorn and i realized i 've never watch butch cassidy and the sundance kid so i added that to my list .
calorie counting could have easily told him why he was n't gaining weight .
clearly reddit user u/dietcokeandprotein knows why this professional athlete failed if only takanoyama had him as a coach maybe be could have succeeded !
there are affordable low cost animal hospitals there is care credit there are groups that help owners with their medical bills .
there are options for owners who need help financially .
and yes it 's nice when hospitals can help owners with finances but it 's not okay for owners to displace their financial responsibility to a hospital and get upset when they ca n't lower the estimate for the cost of care .
the hospital ca n't give away free medication away unless it 's donated they ca n't give your free injections because it costs the hospital whatever they pay for they have to charge you .
a person can be bummed out that a hospital ca n't help them with cost but it 's not okay to now be upset at a hospital and make them feel responsible financially for your pet because you are n't .
and there 's after care too so you 're asking a hospital to just write off 1000 or more dollars when that means that they might have to lay off employees or even close or not be fully stocked with medication or supplies they need to help out other pets and owners .
if you ca n't afford proper care for your animal when the time comes it 's the owners responsibility to choose what to do .
yes euthanasia is an option when an owner ca n't afford proper care and the after care is going to be even more also if the pet is going to suffer more with half ass care .
good example parvo ideally your pet should be on iv fluids injections and oral meds for 2-3 days in hospital .
owners who ca n't afford that we send them home with fluids to give sq and oral meds not ideal and something we do n't do for pets that are severally sick .
if the pet has parvo and is severely sick and the owner ca n't afford the proper treatment so the pet does n't suffer at home than yes i think euthanasia is an option because that animal might not even make it .
and then once it goes home it still needs medications and rechecks .
i 've had owners relinquish their pets because they could n't afford care and they could n't handle afford after care .
to me that 's one of the biggest sacrifices an owner can do for their pet that 's in the pets best interest .
because what if something else happens are you going to expect the hospital to give an owner more free services discounter services every time those types of owners bring their pets in no ?
look i get where your coming from but like anything you really have to be in the business to understand the economics and why hospital ca n't always just give free services or low cost services away to everyone because we get 10 dire situations a week every day if you work at an emergency hospital and usually half the owners ca n't afford treatment .
so trying to keep your business afloat while trying to help owners you 're going to get some animals people who you ca n't help financially .
it 's business a veterinary hospital is a business not a charity people do n't get that .
in the book of philemon one of the last books in the nt we have the story of a xian slave running away from a xian master and he asks for help and that bastion of moral virtue paul tells him togo back .
jesus himself talks many times about slavery not once does he say it 's wrong insta he tells slave s to shut up and work hard without complaining .
xians did n't abolish slavery the british gov which is not xian but secular started the abolishment process and it used the royal navy to force everyone else .
the major opponents of abolishment was the church of england catholics and other european churches who were major investors with slaves .
same goes in america where the bible belt south was on the side of slavery .
paul also says women should be silent in church and covered .
jesus himself took 12 men as his apostles with some relegated to being just ordinary followers .
xians saw this and continue that fine tradition today .
jesus himself says in mat5 19 to follow moses laws and teach a learn them if u want togoto heaven .
jesus love thy neighbour is a direct quote of lev 19:18 he always quotes moses in matters of law.. go read leviticus now .
the ot does sanction killing gays go read it .
it was n't murder to kill them it was the law .
murder is an illegal killing killing gays was the law .
i have n't seen these at any store just yet but i think they 'll be at cvs/walgreens and walmart according to milani 's ig .
the politicians who are in the power are corrupt but only the ones that i dislike .
i think it 's fine not to pay all my taxes but that 's not being corrupt that 's being smart
fuck brazil i wish i was in usa or europe
fuck dilma and lula and their corrupt worker 's party '' i wish there was a military dictature back because the people were safe that way not under some communist bullshit
you guys who are n't from brazil can see this getting upvoted but do n't be mistaken everything have two sides and that 's the hate from the ones that lost the election .
if anyone wan na talk about politics in brazil hit me up .
edit here is a link https www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/403id7/apparently_the_intz_red_canids_had_negotiated/cyrcmhe with some arguments and sources about corruption .
who 's this 38 fella and what is he doing on our pp ?
playing recklessly is dangerous especially when you see denna laing going into the boards and now the news that she 's paralyzed because of it .
thankfully injuries of that severity are rare but it takes only one misstep .
him taking a one year deal would clearly be a stall to next offseason when the fa market is weaker and he thinks he can get a bigger long term deal .
i was initially reluctant because i 'm all in favor of rebuilding the farm system but this would really just delay the drafting of one first round pick .
if we can trade gardner for a solid starter or even solid prospect i 'd be on board .
i was seeing a girl for a while who loved giving head she would get so hot doing it that she would occasionally have an orgasm without any stimulation to herself .
because of the bumps to me it looks like a pistol attached to a wooden club .
we tried it on her twice now the first time completely unprepared no lube but she was saying go for it so we tried and failed miserably .
the second time was recently and i was so overly cautious i think she got bored and i was so tense i could n't stay hard well enough to get inside her .
and then i 'd love her to peg me .
currently still stick a finger in there every so often as we have sex which pretty much makes me orgasm immediately .
but we 've not gone as far as real prostate play or anything .
we 've talked about it but outside of those couple of times she never mentions anything close to it at all which makes me think she 's not interested but is n't willing to tell me no .
almost any design that uses quads to represent individual pixels is doomed .
when i go to bed i take melatonin which helps a lot .
you can buy it online and its natural on your body .
well let 's hear it how would you improve upon the design with a pile of 2x4s and plywood lying around .
do you need to load the amount equivalent to the subscription or is something like 100 pesos fine ?
trying not to eat at night your making it rough
while im happy to have a new method to train with it should not make leveling rcing quicker at all .
people are usually like oh crap ringo sang again '' or damn he should only be let around the mic when he 's narrating thomas the tank engine '' but i love this song .
but that does n't stop my father and sister singing about how he would n't be able to fit his nose beneath the waves .
probably die in a car crash while using the world as my racetrack .
do you have any ssj3 goku with ssj2 gohan together and if not just ssj3 goku or just ssj2 gohan
the rest of the comment still holds though with him not adding it into that specific passage like writing it in and trying to pass it off as genuine and him saying that the golden rule has precedence when commands contradict each other which makes it a matter of interpretation rather than something that was added in
it kind of does as universities are much more lenient on their 'home ' degrees .
for example in the uk the a-level requirements will be ridiculously low compared to the ib score required sometimes .
at 30 it 's painfully obvious i 'm not cool anymore .
the concept of punishment for irresponsibility is not limited to weapons though .
if there is a common expectation that gun owners should keep their weapons secure how else would it be enforced ?

8:08 and still not 1 racist comment in a thread of 50 comments .
the only one bringing race and racism up is you .
i 'd implement a policy where you lost 1 karma point for every down vote you gave .
it would keep many from down voting for no good reason .
if you are really feeling it you wo n't mind sacrificing a point of your own .
dead space is the only game i 've ever beaten on the release date .
would love to see one sue when these new eos go into effect .
now you can get into personal responsibility if you want .
'if you 're not prepared to have a baby and ca n't afford condoms do n't have sex . '
are you against the killing of fetuses or is this about a vendetta on people without a lot of personal responsibility ?
i 'm saying that people not taking personal responsibility is a root cause of these unwanted pregnancies .
do n't be so naive as to think that my whole stance is based on an opposition of those without personal responsibility .
not having subsidized condoms is something that affects poor people a group already notable for having a lot of unwanted kids possibly because of reasoning above .
a richer person wo n't even notice the added cost .
yet there 's the option to not use condoms and save a bit of money .
first i 'd ask how you plan to put this into effect .
would this be a government mandate placed on private corporations ?
or would it be as it is now where the federal government funds businesses like planned parenthood ?
if it 's the first it 'd be grossly unconstitutional as it violates the allowance of religious freedom by forcing adherence to doctrinal violations .
well one of the supposed reasons why poor people have a lot of kids is that sex is one of the few free avenues of entertainment that is both very enjoyable and as i said free .
not having subsidized condoms is something that affects poor people a group already notable for having a lot of unwanted kids possibly because of reasoning above .
a richer person wo n't even notice the added cost .
yet there 's the option to not use condoms and save a bit of money .
forgive me if i misinterpreted you but basically what you 're insinuating is that the rich should pay for the entertainment of the poor by paying for their subsidized condoms that reduce that risk of them having to face the consequences of their actions .
this is absolutely ridiculous why do n't the rich pay for the poor 's movie tickets instead would that fix the problem ?
are you against the killing of fetuses or is this about a vendetta on people without a lot of personal responsibility ?
i 'm against the killing of fetuses '' and am saying that a root cause of the controversy is a condoned lack of personal responsibility on the part of those conceiving unwanted children .
that second quote up there though that speaks of a mentality that 's more about blaming people than about actually solving the stated problem vis-a-vis 'the killing of fetuses . '
the reason i say this is because the context of that quote does n't ... make a lot of sense .
no i 'm not focusing on berating those that lack personal responsibility i 'm identifying it as a key contributor to the problem .
you agree that insufficient sex-ed is partly to blame but expect everyone to know about condoms somehow anyways ?
you can see how i might be confused by that .
i 'm saying i support comprehensive sex ed whatever that may encompass but honestly ca n't fathom how anyone on their own ca n't find out what condoms are or how to use them especially in such a connected era what with the internet .
was it the lack of birth control condoms or abortions especially free ones that so severely hurt the poor during the 1960 's ?
oh wait that problem was n't at the forefront of pressing social issues .
out of wedlock birthrates during the 60 's was at 5 .
a lack of social stigma against illegitimate '' births likely contributed to this rise among other things and this disappearance of a stigma has been subconsciously appreciated by social progressives despite it 's negative effects .
and no i am not living on noodles i am on the road alot because of my job at the moment and noodles are easy so i eat them alot but my diet is quite healthy overall
yup that 's the one i 'm building currently .
it 's essentially the same thing as monoprice is selling but monoprice is n't using an open source bill of materials .
with 3d printers something is always going to break so it 's much better when you have 1000 sellers undercutting each other rather than being able to only buy parts from monoprice for inflated prices .
you 're turning a pile of parts into a working machine rather than ordering from monoprice and it pretty much just working out of the box .

defensive duelist is a guarantee of not getting hit .
you use it after you see the roll so you know whether or not using defensive duelist will block the attack .

how exactly would the kz government go about actually intercepting this communication ?
the user 's browser will be using a different certificate and thus a different encryption algorithm with the website in question will it not ?
the private key in the kz root will not decrypt that traffic .
now if they were redirecting your requests to their own infrastructure with the bogus root ca then yes they could use a proxy to pretend to be said website and perform mitm attacks however it sounded like kz did n't really have much infrastructure in place or else they could also put a firewall up .
i was at a house party and my girlfriend and i were asleep on the couch when we wake up to our friends pitting outside stuff in the house like a lawnmower and ladder in the living room and the lighter fluid in the oven with the door open .
we had no idea wtf was going on so we just go back to sleep .
we find out what happened in the morning and the host made the gf and myself bacon and eggs for helping clean up
i think gear being powerful is good but i agree that set bonuses and trinkets are a bit overwhelming .
by all means make it so a 700 raid trinket gives you 2 more dps than a 700 mythic dungeon trinket for example but do n't completely fuck up the item budgets such that the trinket from mythic dungeons is nothing but vendor trash .
people are still going to wear the best items they can get and those that consistently show up for raids are going to do consistently more damage than those who do n't and that is great it just does n't have to be collossally huge .
set bonuses i understand the appeal of even less .
i have a 4pc it just does shitty irritating things to my rotation and i 'd rather just wear offset gear and not have to carry around a bunch of gear in my bags to swap into when the fight is such that the 4pc is useful .

perhaps you could provide more info on these glitches ?
yes absolutely you nailed it my desire to not have irrational hatred unquestioningly launched towards the president on a daily basis is my secret cover for a dictatorship .
shitty dumb fucks who ca n't have a rational debate without jumping on the nazi socialist dictator train are precisely what is wrong with your country and more importantly the culture it fosters .

bought a oldschool arc welder and some rods for 250 and scrounged together some scrap pipe leftover from a construction site and some old rusty steel chainplate .
mounting brackets were drawn up to scale on graph paper with basic measurements and then sent to my local waterjet place to be cut out of 3/8 steel alternatively you can trace your measurements out by hand and cut with a angle grinder
it 's a really great learning experience i practiced a lot with arc welding before tackling the bumper but between youtube videos and cheapo 6010 rods it all came together !

all of them really space marines are on a completely different level from any ground troops in star wars .
really well worded defense.you are absolutly right and im glad there is someone in this thread whose not just mindlessly bashing the prequels .
with a few small changes i feel the prequels could have been really strong movies .
as they are they have many good ideas and are really enjoyable if you just get through some bad parts

well the op is a cpa who is a mod of this sub and was simply posting a link to an irs webpage .
you 're the one who started giving advice without knowing what the situation is really there is n't a situation since there was never a question to begin with .
then you said he was wrong after he pointed out that sometimes rental income goes other places than sch e when it absolutely can .
so i would n't worry about it too much .
these threads are for nothing but knee jerk reactions .
the lakers played well tonight so it means that they deserve to have 19 nationally televised games while being 9-25 btw yes i 100 undertand the logistics of viewership and ratings .

it 's 33 degrees out here and i 'm tired .

he is no braver than the average isis soldier .
bruh i know you 're trying to get a point across but comparing isis soldiers and coalition soldiers just is n't accurate .
this soldier died in a fight against the taliban and al qaeda .
isis kills civilians in their effort to spread religious doctrine and gain power .
there is tragic loss of civilian life in coalition airstrikes but that 's a far cry in magnitude and morality from filling mass graves with thousands of executed bodies .
maybe by the barebones definition of bravery there 's some comparison to be made but we all know there are other connotations at play

my 100 year old grandma asked me to set up a security camera so she could see who was stealing her clothes at her assisted living facility so i brought over a wireless camera and started to install an app on her ipad for monitoring .
i needed her apple id to download the app so i asked her what her password was .
she poked around in her notebook and said required '' .
it was the wrong password so i told her and she looked up at me and said 'i know that it is right .
i remember it said your password is required . '' '
title said it all this should help prevent players with animal farm from hitting passive mobs with sweep attack .
the game will need 2 new nbt tag called 'passive ' and 'hostile '
mob with 'passive ' tag will ignored by sweep attack .
mob with 'hostile ' tag will affected by sweep attack .
for every successful hit the game will check a entities 's type .
if you are fighting mob in animal pen the game will need to check the type of mob you are hitting with sweep attack .
if you attacking a zombie while there are 2 passive mob like sheep beside it the game will still use sweep attack on zombie but will not hurt the sheep beside it .

but really if any of you have read the communist manifesto itself you 'd know that socialism is more than what the cultural revolution or the chinese annexation of tibet was .
tibet was highly in need of reform or revolution because whether we like it or not the monasteries and aristocrats did hold disproportionate sway over tibet 's economy politics etc .
but if you read the biographies of bapa phuntsok wangyal and his group of thinkers you 'd know there were tibetans in tibet who were willing to enact and striving for change in our country .
what went wrong was them joining the tibetan communist party into the ccp and giving china a platform to commence the annexation of tibet .
an hour ago i put my lenovo 510p into energy save mode .
when i tried to reactivate the laptop nothing happens .
i removed the batterie and the power cord put everything back in and hit the power button
the power button and the power '' led on the front shines continuously but nothing else happens .
removing the battery and power cord pressing power button 10 times in a 1 second interval then holding it for 30 seconds has n't helped .

so i used to watch naruto in japan and one of the openings was bluebird '' by ikimono gakari .
i did n't know they put the name of the song artist name in the opening/ending back then so i was wondering what the song was called since i liked the song .
my japanese back then was n't that great so i did n't really understand the words of the song except for one part .
that part went like aoi aoi ano sora '' which means that blue blue sky '' .
those words in japanese are simple to understand and the singer sang it loudly so i could easily understand what she said .
now my googling skills were terrible back then and i simply googled aoi sora '' instead of something like aoi sora naruto lyrics . ''
apparently aoi sora '' is the name of a pornstar so that came up instead of the naruto lyrics i was searching for .
i was still young back then so i did n't understand what these results were and that may haven been the first time i 've been exposed to any porn-related things in my life ...
tl dr tried to look up naruto lyrics with my terrible googling skills found a pornstar instead .
there 's a few videos like it that make fun of the prequels but there 's this one in particular with violin played over top of it and flashbacks to anakin getting engulfed in flames .
it 's a little cheesy but really well done .

i work at a hotel and fell for a scam that ended with a customer being put on the line with what i thought was a manager who needed to be have his credit info verified .
the customer then gave his info to the guy on the phone .
i then received a call saying that it was a scam and that the customer needed to cancel his card immediately .
no charges were made and everything is cancelled and he 's getting a card overnight ed to him but still feel like shit for falling for a now obvious scam .
this is an automatic summary original http observer.com/2016/01/hillarys-emailgate-goes-nuclear reduced by 73 .
the most interesting part is that the report describes a conversation quot in confidence quot that happened on the evening of june 7 just one day before blumenthal sent the report to secretary clinton .
the june 8 2011 blumenthal report doesn 039 t read like cia material at all in other words human intelligence or humint but very much like signals intelligence or sigint .
sigint reports which i 039 ve read thousands of have a very distinct style and flavor to them and blumenthal 039 s write-up matches it right down to the quot source comments quot which smack very much of nsa reporting and its quot house rules . ''
one agency official expressed to me quot at least 90 percent confidence quot that blumenthal 039 s june 8 report was derived from nsa reports and the agency ought to be investigating the matter right now .
how did sid blumenthal who had no position in the u.s. government in 2011 and hasn 039 t since bill clinton left the white house fifteen years ago possibly get his hands on such highly classified nsa reporting ?
why did he place it an open non-secure email to hillary who after all had plenty of legitimate access as secretary of state to intelligence assessments from all our spy agencies ?
moreover how did the state department think this was unclassified and why did it release it to the public ?
it 039 s possible this blumenthal report did not come from nsa but perhaps from another non-american intelligence agency but whose ?
if sid was really able to get top-level intelligence like this for hillary using just his shoestring operation and get it into her hands a day later with precise information about the high-level conspiracy that was just discussed over in sudan the intelligence community needs to get him on our payroll stat .

picked up an onhub tonight and set it up which went flawlessly good job onhub team .
now i use centurylink dsl i know but it 's either them or comcast .
now i have up to 40mbps but i 'll pull on average around 24-25mbps .
now for those who do n't know what that is it 's dish network 's answer to streaming live television over the internet .
now it streams in high definition unless your bandwidth starts to suffer so naturally i picked the xbox one for priority and waited to see if there was any improvement .
it actually seemed to make the quality worse as it had to buffer more often .
sure enough turning off prioritization made the stream buffer less .
i do n't know what the protocols are for prioritization or how it really works in depth but it seems like there 's a disconnect somewhere in between .
any tips on getting the most out of my router besides rooting it seriously i do n't want to ?
i have this steam rungame/730/76561202255233023/+csgo_econ_action_preview 20s76561198054016761a4784561939d11721990545373893757 karambit with a fv of .8225 http puu.sh/mqcja/ff2ce89005.jpg

i think my price is quite fair but offer what you will .
my girlfriend is not a virgin and has a mild traumatic sexual history .
we sleep in the same bed every night for like 3 months playing around naked most nights .
she puts my penis to her vaginal opening nothing wrong with that .
somehow i did n't realize the difference between being against the opening and the tip barely being in .
she gets incredibly aroused gets on top of me and puts the tip in her .
i give her an expression like what the fuck ? ''
she 's like do n't worry it 's just the tip .
i tacitly let it go and then she full on mounts me and starts riding .
at some point my reason kicks back in and i go limp .
she freaks out and is about to cry saying stuff like what have i done .
i try to make her feel better by saying i could have stopped it .
now its a few days later and im reflecting upon the situation .
im mad at myself for getting so engrossed in our activities that i didnt notice how far we had gone .
and that when she mounted me instead of kicking her off i was too busy thinking to myself that this is how a vagina feels .
but im also mad at her for taking it so far without permission .
she also thinks that we should just do it since we crossed the line but i dont want to .
like i was a virgin by choice and now i dont know how to deal with this .
i dont want to be mad at her and i do believe that i should have kicked her off as soon as it started but that doesnt really excuse her actions .
i cant think straight right now i blame myself but the more i think about this the more im starting to see it as her fault .
im a reasonable guy but my thoughts are starting to be come a mess .
i cant honestly talk to her because im either going to try to console her or lash out .
and if im left to myself theres a chance ill become unjustly resentful .
tl dr i wanted to stay a virgin gf mounts me was it rape ?
sorry about this massive shitpost but being from az i do n't know your team that well but i know kaepernick .

how many episodes do you have to watch before you know what the heck 's going on ?
jones was up to his old tricks even after death .
after the savage display of barbarity people went back to their routine .
i began to watch and wonder how this had happened .
i 've been meaning to speak with you . ''
was this going to be my turn to be mobbed ?
you know companies like that support both sides selling weapons of death to make a profit ?
how many of your hard earned dollars did you give them ? ''
it was a.. gift.. '' i said and jones smiled .
you stole it from a man named.. snake i believe . ''
i bet you 've heard that before but this time things are different .
we 're not fighting a war that ca n't ever possibly be won . ''
you let a holy man die and you did n't even look back as you fled .
stay out of my head or i 'll blow yours offyour shoulders. ! ''
you know i could give the signal and they 'd beat you with a garden hose until you were just as black and blue as jacob .
all i 'd have to do is give a reason..
you on the other-hand are pretty low close to rock-bottom i 'd say .
you join up and your life will turn around i guarantee it goddamn it ho more running .
no more drifting from town to town worrying about the cops and that monster you 've been cursed with .
you call what you did to jacob 'peace ' ? ''
and letting a man live his entire life on the run in fear . ''
this was n't like the mind games of the vampires .
you 'll realize what the right choice is soon enough .
you 'll see what i mean soon enough . ''
i give the word my people go to defensive positions and ready themselves .
that sounds pretty hateful for a pacifistic commune . ''
it was the urge to enact an eye for an eye . ''
you can change anything if you stay with us . ''
if i stay with you how do you plan to stop it ? ''
and when the entity as you call it strikes we 're going to teach it a lesson about vulnerability . ''
just to prove it to you i 'll show you something . ''
jones went to the intercom and over the loud speaker began broadcasting .
the commune ignited into a frenzy of movement scrambling for rifles pistols knives .
what the fuck kind of game are you playing ? ''
you 're gon na realize that what 's necessary and what 's going to take place .
what happened to your friend that was n't you .
you 're in good graces among the temple . ''
now we 've got firepower here and it 'll protect us against enemies foreign or domestic .
the things i learned in guyana the gods of the natives they can be caught bound .
i 'm alive because i bound myself to those nameless gods and became one . ''
the only thing i see is a dead man trying to play his hand at being kurtz . ''
great book about the ivory trade and it 's savagery .
heard they burnt down a beautiful jungle for a movie version of it .
these people who rule the world they 're the ones who are insane . ''
i 've got so much work to do . ''
you 're fighting an unwinnable war just like you said . ''
you 're not as good at getting into people 's heads as you 'd like to be drifter .
i 'm going to walk the earth for a good while longer . ''
that 's because there 's nothing in this world that 's black and white . ''
said jones and i knew in my heart he had orchestrated my arrival to the compound .
soon they were wheeling out military surplus as they did every night .
they were paranoid that the world might spill inward on them at any second that they would be found out .
they were the kind of people that liked to hide in the shadows lest the heat accelerate their decay .
those with him they smelled of fear and self-delusion .
his inner-circle they were all alive for the most part .
they were n't like the brainless bastards that walked the earth inside the compound .
a nervous smile and eyes that held a message one slip up and they 'd become just like the others without a mind or a soul .
so are you willing to give us a chance ?
i looked down from the top of the compound into the courtyard .
wanted to save his sister from me thinking i was the villain .
now he 's dead and ai n't never gon na save no one from nothin ' .
it 's sad really how foolish people can be . ''
he would have never come around to our way of life .
he would have always been a bad influence on dear sister seka and we do n't need that not in these trying times . ''
you 're still the sick bastard you always were . ''
but once your entity shows up and is thrust out you 'll recognize why we live as we do . ''
how far do you think you can make it then ? ''
i knew you had half a brain in you . ''
the entity was a day out a day and a half away at most .
the idea of staying here made me sick but i had no other options .
i keep my companions in two spots sanctuary or red rocket .
i went to check red rocket in case i 'd sent him there and found hancock dead actually dead as in i could loot his body and he was n't talking to me .
as i 'm on an xbox and not a pc do i have any way of fixing this ?
i assume i 'd have to use a console to respawn nick somewhere to grab him .
no idea how i 'd fix the hancock issue tho .
i 've been working on this idea for a while and now i 've decided to pull the trigger and see if i can get some raw data on if this kind of thing is viable .
i want to establish a board game cafe ... potentially in asheville .
i say potentially because right now i live in raleigh but i went to school at wcu and asheville has remained one of my favorite places to be .
i also feel like given the atmosphere of the city a board game cafe could be quite successful in asheville as well .
so here is a little marketing survey https docs.google.com/forms/d/1rbnrqdz6kkd8xrzztpz_lzjak32_nrupcovlarrvjv8/viewform i 've whipped up .
if you have a few minutes i 'd really appreciate anyone taking the time to answer the survey .
it 'd provide me some priceless data that i could analyze to get a working business plan together .
if you have any advice questions or feedback i 'd be happy to hear them !
the emperor due to a lack of several communication ways has decided that he will establish new cobblestone roads between the capital city and the several main cities of the empire .
the roads will connect mainly th political centre of the nation bakar to the west and its important trading cities such as sakuman tbilisi xacmaz and hosan .
the emperor has also sent some representatives of the emperor to become the official mayors of the cities .
the parthian empire is also becoming more open with their neighbors and have already connected infrastructure with the peoples of armenia and especially the city of yerevan .
this has also come with zoroastrian preachers entering the city once the roads are constructed .
the roads will avoid all the mountainous terrain possible and has been located in the plain areas of the caucuses area .
the road will take from 10 to 12 years to construct as the workers will have some difficulty with limited cobble mines .
the emperor has stated that this despite the massive time and cost will help the future of the empire and will help its culture spread through out the region .
this he stated will probably make the parthian empire a regional player when it comes to the caucuses .
had some random teammate named phobicpenny4 '' kill our 4 man party twice .
ubi needs to do like rockstar did and put the bad players amongst their own .
so to put this simply my kitchen sink reeks .
it smells bad enough that it makes me nauseous and i 've tried just about everything i can think of to make it smell better .
orange peels bleach baking soda ... running hot water for like 20 minutes straight .
i think there 's an issue with the disposal .
it runs but i do n't think it clears everything out of the sink if that makes sense .
so i think what 's happening is stuff is just sitting there rotting .
i live in an apartment so i could ask maintenance about it but they almost never answer my pleas for fixing things they are probably annoyed my apartment is n't a renovated one so basically everything in it is broken .
so i thought i 'd check here to see if anyone knows how i can fix it myself .

i dont care if no one read this i just want to keep the progress beacuse i really want to change and i have no one to share this .
i will write the days and maybe a text to show how i feel
i hope this is the right place to post this .
when i was 19 i bought a house along with my brother and my mother .
long story short they 're not very nice people .
i finally got the courage to leave when i was 20 and tried to never look back .
i was making payments on the house when i was still living there but stopped once i moved out .
i expected them to stop paying the mortgage once i left but i kept checking my credit score on a regular basis and found that they were paying every month .
this all started in 2009 house purchased in 2008 .
i 've had no contact with them since i left until now .
my brother is threatening to stop making payments and file for bankruptcy unless i refinance the house with them .
they refuse to give me the contact information for the lending agent and simply keep saying that this agent has already tried to contact me and i refuse to return his calls/emails which is a lie .
my brother is asking for my signature but has not provided me with any paperwork that i can look over .
he informed me of all this via email this morning saturday and wrote in the email that i have until monday to reply .
i 've always expected it to go this route but now that i 've been given a deadline to reply i 'm a little nervous .
my thoughts were always that if things were to end this way my credit would simply be ruined and i 'd have to work to rebuild it for several years .
if this is the only consequence i can live with that .
i guess my question is can the do anything else to me other than ruin my credit for a few years ?
is there other consequences that i do n't know about ?
i wo n't sign anything without knowing all the details .
it was a mistake buying the house to begin with but i was young and thought i was helping myself in the long run .
adult me today realizes this was a bad idea but kid me back then did n't know any better .
it all sounds really shady to me and my brother has been known to be involved in illegal activity before so i 'm planning on staying as far away as possible .
i 'll contact a lawyer if i have to but i just do n't know what the potential consequences even begin .
as a side note i am now married and have two kids if that makes a difference .
i 'll do whatever i must to keep this from affecting my family as much as possible .
any on here if that last post was hidden away by the spam filter when i spent like 10 minutes writing it up .
for the longest time i 've been meaning to plunge myself into my confucian studies push myself harder to be a better confucian and a better student .

i want to understand the classics and i wan na learn the lessons from someone who has lived and learned .

only one more day to vote for this crucial endorsement !
last year a study conducted by professors at princeton and northwestern university on public policies dating back to 1981 reported unequivocally that the united states is no longer a democracy but rather resembles the financial-political ecology of an oligarchy .
as a grandson and great grandson of veterans who fought on behalf of american democracy abroad i am infuriated that their sacrifice has devolved into the current plutocratic political and economic system which were we any other country would be internationally called out for what it is rigged and corrupt .
at a time when the so-called billionaire class owns or exerts unethical curatorial control over all major national media and print outlets including such progressive mainstays as the new york times and national public radio it is imperative that the few organizations which can not be purchased either through remuneration or political favors stand together to protect the fabric of our nation 's democracy .
in bernie sanders i have seen the sort of candidate that comes along perhaps once in a lifetime .
not only is he among the most tireless fighters for the middle class in recent decades he embodies the rarest quality of a person in politics he is incorruptible either by money or power .
has there been in your lifetime another candidate and serious presidential contender of whom you could say the same ?
while we as a country may disagree on different policies which different candidates put forth the debate is moot if once that candidate is elected they represent the big-money interests which donated to their campaign rather than the average worker who voted for them .
once we remove the influence of money from politics then we can get to work debating the direction of our country as is the provenance of every citizen in a democracy .

back home in north carolina i have a niece that almost lost her life to a small peanut .
i also have other relatives/family members with life-threatening allergies .
some of them have to carry epipen in their purses all the time .
granted some chinese friends do n't eat sea food or drink milk or eat cheese but i have never heard single one of them talking about fatal conditions .
none of them seem to know what epipen is and on top of everything some of them have the ridiculous belief that if you eat sea food as often as possible you can tough it out and eventually cure yourself .
i also have never seen posters in any chinese school cafeteria on this .
i 'm not a teacher so i have only been to chinese schools a handful of times .
i 've been here for almost a decade but this never was a major issue on the radar .
i was just wondering because every mmorpg i 've played so far for a longer period of time seemed to have inflationary markets .
which means almost all item-prices were significantly lower at the release of the mmo compared to a few years later .
and i 'm not just talking about a few percent what i experinced are prices rising over several hundred percent .
of course these prices can drop again for example if a new expansion is coming up but they always stayed higher than they were at release .
well ... if that 's the natural development of mmo markets would n't it be a good idea to invest all your money at the release of a new mmo in valuable items and then wait until you have the feeling the inflation has reached it 's global peak for example when a new expansion/big update is coming up the market usually freezes people stop spending their money because they want so see which changes the expansion will bring prices will stop rising and then sell all of these items .
because if you host all your fortune as pure money it 's value is getting lower and lower with time .
kind of in a rush so sorry about any mistakes .

for a campaign a friend is running we 've been told we can only use content from the first player 's handbook for the life of me i ca n't tell you why and since i ca n't use barbarian i figure i 'll use what i think is the next best thing a great weapon fighter .
problem is that i do n't have much experience in this kind of 4th used to playing heavily homebrewed stuff and starting at level 15 now we 're doing normal and starting at level 1 or in fighters so besides the fact i need strength and constitution i have n't the foggiest .
i think i 'd like to either use a greatsword or scythe but i 'm not sure how good they are in 4th or anything like that .
oh also i was planning on going the boring dragonborn fighter maybe eladrin if i feel like not doing as well in combat but having more fun rping .
so i wrote a simple library management system in python which you can see here https github.com/konsbn/xlibris .

hey guys i know we are usually not allowed to talk about cheaters on reddit but i was wondering

have not really played the game for almost a year mge back then .
one reason i stopped playing the game was reoccuring shoulder and wrist pain not super bad but defenitly not comfortable to play with the pain
i have a very ergonomic setup chair keyboard desk monitor position and so on because playing csgo or not i spend most of the day at the pc anyway and i do n't want to run into big trouble later in my life only 21 .
so the setup itself is not the problem note i am not using my ergonomic mouse for csgo because im claw grip guy zowie fk2 is what i switch to for gaming .
overall i think i am a pretty unrelaxed regarding muscles player when playing focused .
my hand and arm are almost always tensed even for simple crosshair placements my muscles are not really relaxed .
i hear all the time that you should play relax and i totaly do that regarding my thinking and mentality ingame but defenitely not regarding my arm/hand muscles .
when i play with relaxed arm sometimes in dm i feel like my aim is more inconsistend and my crosshair placement is overall worse is this just because i am not used to it and practice by just forcing myself to stay relaxed physically would resolve it ?
how do you play and do you have any problems ?
while at my last job i was her manager and she was my employee .
she was married but i would find out later not happily .
i 've always had a thing for older women and just looking at her you can tell she likes sex .
blonde 5'3ish huge tits fat ass very flirty attitude .
it started with her giving me her phone number and texting me while she was on vacation .
it started pretty innocent at first but she did send a picture of a naked women she had drew in the sand so i assumed her head was in the same place as mine .
we texted back and forth for a couple weeks before we both admitted we wanted to hookup .
the taboo of her being my employee made things so much hotter .
i also have a very dominant personality and she wanted to have sex with me bad enough she would do whatever i asked .
one time during her lunch break she went to the bathroom took off her panties and gave them to me in my office which had no door and was completely visible to the rest of the warehouse .
i was so hard as i played with her still warm panties .
her nervous giggling and concern about getting caught made it even hotter !
after some more sexting we finally decided to meet up outside of work .
we met at the parking lot of a store right down the street from my apartment .
she got into my car and proceeded to direct my hand between her legs to feel the hole she had torn in her leggings .
i asked her if she wanted to go back to my place and she was more than willing .
we get to my place and sit down on my bed .
she puts her hand in my crotch and we begin to make out .
she ca n't contain herself any longer she falls to her knees takes my cock out and starts going to town .
after a few minutes of sucking she says please fuck me ! '' .
i play with them and suck on her nipples until she ca n't handle it anymore and needs me inside her .
she 's on her back and trying to slide me inside her but she is so tight it wo n't fit .
as she struggles to shove my cock in her she begins to whimper '' oh god i need this !
i decide a different angle might help so i tell her to get on all fours .
i begin fucking her from behind and within a minute her face is buried in the pillow and is screaming as the first orgasm comes .
i 'm not sure how many times she came but after about 15-20 minutes i can feel i 'm about to bust .
i pull out she turns around and immediately takes me back into her mouth .
she goes to town on my cock cleaning her own cum off and playing with my balls like pro .
soon i blow my load into her mouth and she shows my cum before running off to spit it out in the sink .
i do n't work there anymore but i still hear from her about once a month saying how badly she needs me to fuck her again .
i 've been using the blackguard cb tree path for the entirety of the game so far 100 hours and never once have i witnessed the paralysis proc from my cb .
now i realize the proc has a 1/3 chance to happen and combined with a slow cb motion its unlikely .
however i decided to use a crow tessen which has a poison proc .
i have been on quite a few hunts with it and never have i once witnessed a poison proc with it .
is it just my luck or is there something i 'm overlooking ?
hey everyone there was a thread on this during exp and the census was that they last half an hour .
just wondering if anyone knows if this has changed with the move to stable ?
i have a bunch of grenades and weapons at my camp and seeing as my barrels are getting full i thought i 'd do a cleanout and turn myshkino tents into a living hell for anyone who wants to loot .
but if the tripwires are gon na despawn i might as well lob them in .
my h s app crashes after i try to launch it after booting into my emunand .
also tried the fbi.cia steps on https gbatemp.net/threads/tutorial-installing-rxtools-custom-firmware-3ds-and-2ds.390867 in part 4a and there is no option to press emunand when i 'm trying to check my tmd version .
it just says check tmd only and if i press that it says opening secureinfo_a failed and the same for b .
nmom just shared a photo of me from facebook and added beautiful .
she shared it like she had a right to .
i ca n't stand it i am not hers to brag about .
when i was in contact with her she would overly complement me and she still is .
i 've basically got it narrowed down to the rei igneous or north face 's blue kazoo .
while there are some differences when all is said and done i think they would serve equally as well .
i would love your input and experience regarding these .
i 'm pretty sure i 've looked thoroughly but if there 's another consideration for 300 it less let me know .
i dont know if its possible but it would nice if it show the number of new post behind the sub because we dont need to open if theres no new post .

australia currently has 2 frigates stationed off the coast of the uae in the persian gulf which have been used to support the fight against the daesh .
however due to recent events the government is set to discuss whether to keep the frigates there .
we do not want to be involved in any war and the adf has promised the safety of the men and women will be first and foremost .
as for now the adelaide class sent to the uae in 2016 will be recalled to be decommissioned and sold to indonesia .
in it 's place a second anzac class frigate will replace it .
the current land and air force sent by australia to fight the daesh will continue to stay and fight .

is it possible to ignore the bells somehow to pick up neb boxes ?
i 've missed like 3 or 4 boxes because there 's a massive stack of bells underneath them then the stages end before the bells expire so the neb boxes end up disappearing too .

so i want to do something and an indirect action hurts something else mean no one can do it ?
by your logic a vast majority of things done by humans are wrong .
but they are the loudest and fuck shit up royally .
obviously it 's time to leave the old systems in the back .
i 'm afraid activision will want to somehow have a sequal on older gen because sales .
any amount of money and resources spent on old gen is stupid .
there 's so many basic things lacking in destiny .
even if it is a great hit '' it can kill people and should n't be allowed in the game .
it 's disgusting when people like you defend hits like this because it 's just part of the game . ''
as others have pointed out civil asset forfeiture laws allow police to confiscate assets if they merely suspect that said asset is profit of or has been used in a crime .
they do n't need to show actual probably cause they do n't need a warrant and they do n't need to prove that you 're guilty of anything .
if you have large sums of money on you the police can simply take it saying they have cause to suspect that is was proceeds of or involved in a federal drug crime and you will have to go throw hell and high water to get it back .
the idea behind this bullshit was a noble one cartels and mobs oftentimes covered their tracks and could not be legally caught engaging in crime so this allowed law enforcement to take their assets .
in reality it 's simply allowed police departments to literally commit highway robbery .
it means she thinks you move from girl to girl .
then this is every bit the cluster fuck it seems .

everyone is going to say cait but i think she is extremely weak right now .
also i would say start out playing adc that does n't have an escape this will teach you positioning .

i interpreted it as the suitcase being symbolic of something valuable that the bong guy was trying to keep namely his memory of the word delectable but it was the marijuana he was smoking that robbed it from him hence the guy dressed like a tree by sticking it on a hot air balloon and sending it flying right out of his head .

final fantasy vii remake producer yoshinori kitase and director tetsuya nomura shared the latest on the upcoming ps4 title in an interview with dengeki playstation .

the problem with gaga is that she is always busy
i have n't given it a proper chance yet with only about 5 hours put into it but so far it has not sucked me in .
i have pretty limited time for gaming and i think the size of the world just feels overwhelming especially when you can spend 30 minutes just talking to npcs .
the combat encounters feel strange like they 're just dropped in and i do n't have much clue as to what 's happening in the game .
this is my first fallout game so i 'm sure i 'm missing lots of pieces of the puzzle but as someone who was hyped to finally join in on a fallout game i 'm definitely not in love yet .
any tips for beginner fallout players are appreciated though !
the interesting this is that nearly any wire and sometimes other metal things can act as an antenna especially when very near to the transmitter .
i commonly use 19 '' wire for hd tv reception quarter wave jammed in the center hole of the coax coax connector .
it works well even 40 miles from the transmitter .
getting closer to home as op mentioned anything even close to the antenna specs or a multiplier thereof will pickup the station in question .
there are tons of these instances recorded even things such as razor blades have been know to pickup fm stations https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foxhole_radio .
anyway the takeway here is that yes it 's not only possible but probable given the details outlines by op .
i want to like the floris mod but i want to know if there is a way that you can change the troop names back to english and the nobles names back it 's annoying trying to remember them all .
they probably either have crazy straight a pushy parents or live in a school district with a 4.0 average .
in some places that acutally is a medium range score .
i can send more if anyone wants to trade .
it 's pure speculation we wo n't be given conventional starters ftr though i would be very very surprised if we did receive normal starters it 's important to note we have very little confirmed eitherway .
the general theory is you 'll get a random spawn when you start and a 100 success catch rate kind of similar to in geniii when wally catches his raltz although a random pokemon .
i am still watching but i have been tweeting michael goi all season and he has been either ignoring my theories or publicly refuting my ideas .

my nm 'reached out ' for the first time during our nc at xmas via an xmas card from her .
what she wrote did n't do anything to persuade me to end nc .

when i was lc she would start 'hoovering ' being really nice around her birthday to try to get me to participate in her birthday celebrations .
this year i did n't play nice and refused to go to the family dinner narc family dinners hell for the sg and her behaviour afterwards persuaded me to go nc !

cincy embarrassed themselves tonight from the fans to the players .
from the inciting on opposing fans after spearing bernard by dancing on the sidelines and celebrating .
if it was not for this i do not think cincy even comes back from the dead .
additionally you have porter coming onto the field without purpose inciting jones into bumping the official .
the problem is on your end loads just fine on chrome
i see what you did there p tampo printing or whatever they 're using now has come a long way .
fortunately many 1/64 collectors are n't that concerned about it so it 's not too big of a deal when you 're selling .

okay at it 's shortest point the keyboard with oem profile keycaps and bbb case is 1.125 '' 1.25 counting the rubber feet .

i was n't 100 sure myself so i had to test it real quick i actually did n't know that it would update automatically if in the same sheet when just referencing the cell range !

damnit there is literally nothing there i can disagree with .
certainly that was the general approach in the old testament .
however you wo n't really find much in the new testament supporting such a view .
on the other hand the new testament does n't deny the state the right to do such things .
the new testament was n't really intended as a basis for government i 'm sure that one will get me stoned .
personally i think punishment of any kind is mostly counterproductive .
i do n't really see the point in eternal punishment either .
i grew up in lp and i went to northwestern so double welcome i think taking the brown line to downtown from armitage gives you a unique way to see the city especially if you do it around 5 so that you can be sure to see it in the day and also at night .
if you guys like to go to bars there are some chill ones on lincoln ave between wrightwood and webster .
you might want to just walk the 4 blocks between those streets and see what you like .
the store is a fun also kind of gross 4am bar on halsted and armitage where you 'll definitely meet some characters .
if you have time to go for a walk either go by the lake via fullerton or to the 606 .
if you like museums there is a conservatory by the lake just south of fullerton and there 's the nature museum north of fullerton on cannon drive .
in terms of food i recommend any of the non-chain tiny taco places have a great time !

after relocating over the summer i 've been trying to rebuild my client base .
i 'm a speech language pathologist so my referrals come from physicians in my case pediatricians most of the time .
edit for more info i discovered this week that at the private clinic where i contract i am actually getting enough referrals but the insurance person at the clinic has been requiring all children to have a full hearing evaluation with an audiologist before i do an eval .
the standard is a hearing screening which can be done by an slp .
it can be quite difficult to get one scheduled with an audiologist which explains why 90 of my referrals have been getting nowhere .

its things like this that makes me depressed about dota .
the thing is people generally start being less bigoted and more accepting as they live more comfortable lives .
the bigotry towards homosexuality is not mainly engineered from above .
i 'd be surprised if putin personally gave much of a shit .
it 's a populist step that was taken because many russians like it .

holy crap thats very predatory behavior ... . from a guy me who is into cough alternate relationship dynamics thats saying something .
i ca n't really offer any advice on how to handle that situation but i will say that as long as you felt unsafe you were never overreacting .
your safety is always important and being wary of potential predators is part of staying safe .
please do all that you can to avoid another situation where you 're alone with this guy .

i have been carrying my zt 0300bw for a while now .
both book and grail have fallen out of the meta completely .
most either go for spooky ghosts for the stupidly high mana regen and amazingly strong active or roa like you said .
ok so from what i 've seen of the two they will have a few distinct differences in playstyles .
for alesha the best route i 've seen has focused on etb/ltb with things like blood artist impact tremors and similar cards doing some serious work .
it will function at its best when its trying to race everyone down .
sure black has grave pacts and what not that fit in well but focusing the deck purely around stax and keeping stuff out seems not as good .
athereos i feel would be the better stax commander if you want to go hard into that route .
his ability feels more like a crap i got wiped and those creatures really helped maybe i can get them back . ''
so a focus on creatures that just want ro exist constantly with him as back up is probably the best way forward .
and as far as stopping combo goes they both have appeal .
i think the biggest argument in favor of alesha here is red giving you red elemental blast and pyroblast to surprise the blue combo players .
boil is fun if you really just do n't want their crap .
tl dr alesha seems to work best as a etb/death engine while athreos is going to be about having a backup plan .

not many reasons to not run it at 400-500 fps either though
i was n't planning on using it for production but i was wondering because i had to pass parent in self.b b method parent=self .
incidentally b is used in an environment where the method is selected by an external parameter so i am using a self.evaluate self.__getattribute method since it was easier than having to update a dict whenever a new method was written .
also featured is a getattr method for a to setattr undefined parameters from ros parameters which are not always needed or defined .

or the variable that he must have possession while inbounds with 2 feet down before he can even have it considered a catch .

if you play on a pvp server the 2 guys names were blue giraffe major
blue giraffe changed names a couple of times also to admiral and to bok .

queen games have made some nice reprints of a few winsome games titles winsome games only make really small low budget print runs and almost only make train games .
eagle-gryphon games have also reprinted some winsome games train games .
keep in mind though that a lot of train games '' are actually stock holding or stock manipulation games and that is quite a difference from ticket to ride .
when i started playing modern games '' i also started with ticket to ride and really liked the train theme now my taste in games has changed a bit and i really like heavier games so the above games and 18xx https boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx games fit me really well .

like any other tank item you build to counter the enemy .
if the enemy is going to try and poke you or disengage and reset the fight warmog 's is effective at negating poke as well as recharging you for a reengage after their janna and lulu ults have been used .
sterak 's is the more useful item in general if not in the aforementioned situations .
the shield and damage benefits tanks that are able to dive into the enemy team to try and force enemy carries out of position as well as being a more gold efficient item in cases where the passive on warmog 's is useless .

more and more there seems to be this trend on porn sites to cut off the money shots of videos which is really annoying .

usually for the es spheres you can only get 1. so maybe you should make a special sphere the requires wdb but u can only craft 1. also probably make it a stat up sphere instead of a spark buff sphere .

i would save for toty because even with buying the bundle it would still cost a lot to complete the set .
they said this was concept art that became the imperial fighter awhile ago so probably do n't get too excited for it being a big ship .

no but only the first penalty of the bad 2 still happens .
the 2nd one would n't have happened because i imagine most of the defense would be sore due to zimmer 's foot being lodged so far up their ass .

in my opinion the first season was about the decay of mental strength manipulation and the attempt to find clarity in a mess but ultimately failing .
i 'm probably wrong but i could see that the fourth season is hannibal deploying new unseen tactics in an attempt to convert will into what he wants .
it could also again my opinion be a look into the way that hannibal hide himself behind other serial killers in an attempt to normalize himself .

more so that it just confirms that he 's a creep and yes someone having that view in light of the fact that he 's suspicious in this murder case does cast more suspicion onto him .
you can try and use semantics to wriggle out of that position but that 's the position you 're taking .
it 's not using semantics it 's using words correctly .

tome 3 opens by opening the chests.. what secret switch ?
i 've made characters and bios for short stories/games in rpg maker and so forth in the past so i know how long it can take .
i 'm thinking a pre-set of 4 characters that my two friends can pick from with slight modifications from the d d book we go by so it still seems like they 've created them in full and it wo n't be too difficult to keep track the first few times around .
at games in the future when we 're more into everything i can add what seems to be nonsense '' additions/details .
i 'll just print out the sheets and have them ready for the players and bring on the word you say about just keeping in mind what makes sense for who they are rather than keeping an eye on the sheet like a hawk .
blablabla when he was a child he gazed upon the armory of his father .
he views the weapons with awe but there 's two in particular that catches his attention .
a massive warrior axe that takes two hands to wield in order to do proper damage .
but can be folded and carried as a lightweight sword once he reaches a certain level and can carry more items as a result at a later stage and
a broad sword that 's light enough for one hand so a shield if acquired can be used for the other hand but the sword can also be made into a bigger one with another set of blade that he carries on his back thus making carrying several items a difficult task but in situations of serious danger it can become useful after all despite the limited things he can carry and use in combat to help himself to victory .
one of the two weapons might be of interest and drags him towards it .
my idea here is that the warrior sees one of the two walks towards it and if the dice calls for it he also gets a small bottle of healing potion .
'' the father comes into the room delighted to see his son has chosen the path of the warrior and decides to teach him the basics of combat for a year before a hoarde of ghouls rampage the city and kills almost everyone in it along with his parents .
he was lucky enough to be small enough to hide inside a vase or something i 'll come up with something better but was now turned into an orphan and made a promise to avenge his parents .
when he reached the age of xx he finally got strong enough to start practice and build upon the lessons his father taught him . ''
and i 'll come up with something clever as to why he still has access to that weapon or how he acquired it back perhaps a small side quest or whatever depends what he says/choose and how it progress from there i guess .
the two guys i 'm going to play with wo n't use 5 minutes to pick something at least i do n't think so and even if they do it wo n't detract from fun the way i know them .
in a different setting i might go for a more standardized way of doing things to counter this .
something similar for the other class or whatever i come up with .
depends who they choose to go for as well as it will be the grounds of what i make the intro of the story to be .
i have an idea to go by the basic rules and details of characters but only include the essentials to a custom character sheet as to not make it too difficult the first time around and base things on devices/items they find .
one of them that i got in mind is a spell that after acquired can turn a rock into anything they 've seen that weight less than 2 kilograms after the spell is in their possession .
i 'd also prefer and hope the two choose 2 classes that oppose each other warrior and a priest for example so as the story progress one of them will be able to give the other 2 defense or 2 resistence against magic and the other will be able to give 2 attack for one round but they ca n't use both at the same time/same round but that idea may be void as well depending on how it plays out and what makes sense to what i have in mind further on .
i also have an idea of using poker chips as currency in order to keep track of money so healing potions can be bought and use those black yatzee thingys to account for 1 healing potion but they can only carry so much at a time and use no more than one per day this may change as they raise in level and face more difficult opponents and depending on how the story progress as well and what they end up using their imagination for .
not too difficult to keep track of with the right character sheets currency and spells as i plan on making one for every level they gain and use whatever i find in the basement that can define that sort of spell with a physical item .
not sure if it 'll work in practice though but it 'd be fun to try out .
thanks for the advice on keeping the momentum going and not being hooked up on mistakes as that 's something i 'd probably do if i was n't made aware of it .
i 'm also the dm after all and if i 'm good enough and see something ai n't working out i can make it void at some point that makes sense without it being too obvious/boring .
i 'm also going to have the 40/40/20 in mind seems to be a really great rule of thumb .
hopefully i 'll be able to go into character but i guess this takes practice and something i 'll be better at doing over time .
okay this could be difficult to diagnose but you need go see a neurologist .
you could have a small problem but it could be something very severe that needs urgent treatment .
if you black out at the wrong time you could injure yourself or others .
if you have genuinely low blood pressure you 'll need to add salt to your diet and you also get pills that raise your blood pressure .
you 'll have to look at cardiac diseases like dysrhythmias that cause black outs e.g .
you could be producing too little cortisol and this is called addisons that can also lead to light headedness .
neurologically you need to be checked for brain tumors aneurysms avm 's and a whole host of other things .
psychiatric diseases that cause blackouts include anxiety and all the panic disorders but these often feel like you 're having a heart attack and then you pass out .
my best guess is that you suffer from primary hypotension in that you just have low blood pressure .
you 'll need to do as i said above but you must see a specialist .
what you are experiencing is not normal often dangerous and could be a sign of a major medical disease .
put your mind at ease and see someone who knows their stuff .
people will never let those penilities go but that never would 've happened if hill would 've played conservative .
i want to get him in but ca n't fit him into the squad have mahrez/kdb/ozil/alli .
s8 and s9 imo gave us the doctor/companion love story pushed to its underlying truth what happens when the doctor falls with tl depth in love with a human companion who 's enamored by the glamor and excitement of a space/time traveling alien ?
he has an enormously long life span prolonged by a whole new round of regenerations she 's a mayfly fragile and short lived .
so since she does n't want to be safe he drives himself almost literally crazy trying to make her safe while taking her on the best adventures ever and of course failing .
he 's become obsessed not so much with love but with the terror of losing her and his fear of that turns him into a threat to the whole universe who will go to any lengths to keep her .
the only workable solution as he finally sees for himself in hell bent is for them to part company and for him to ditch his obsession along with his memories of the emotional content of his time with her .
so when he meets up at xmas with river on her way to death in the library he shows us what he 's learned from the clara experience when things reach their inevitable ends accept it and let go .
the rebel rocker just grew up out of his defiant teens right before our eyes .
in character terms i do n't think he 's likely to be shown permitting any new companion relationship to go down that painful route again .
in terms of the tone of this long changeable show itself i think everyone is ready now for a new direction .
so i do n't think this is something to worry about .
this made me laugh considerably more than it probably should have .
i 've been getting a lot of different comments about the duration of a trip .
this heavily depends on the dose and the person .
for me and my friend trips usually last 6-8 hours .
if someone took two or more tabs understandably their trip would be a lot longer .
i believe that if one were to follow the guide and take a small dose or half a dose saying their trip would last 14 hours would be misleading .
also feeling a bit different '' is the hangover/afterglow bit i presume and is not part of the actual trip .
i will remain adamant about not putting your phone in flight mode .
in another comment i mentioned a friend who ran off on her first trip without telling us making us go look for her around the city having no idea where she could be .
if her phone was on flight mode there would be no way for us to locate her and make sure she was doing alright .
she had left her phone at home but at that moment we very much wished she had n't .
if a call is unwelcome do n't answer it .
i 'm concerned that there were a few serious errors ''
time is a factor in how long it takes to heal but it 's not the only one .
those who came from long-haul relationships have a lot to process no question about it .
those are losses from the amount of time invested to anything else this relationship cost them .
grieve all of those for however long it takes .
the fact is whatever their feelings were towards you even if they pretended to have them the whole time yours were real toward them and that will take time to sort out .
authentic relationships always take time to develop no shortcuts .
if they did n't last long then either they were flings or the relationship was fast-forwarded in some way .
i could n't find a launcher that i liked quite yet looking into making my own and i need those there for a project i am working on .
that would have at least looked a little better c .
it 'd be a shame to not give it to him for the hateful eight .
both this and the skyrim mod were poorly made and profited from it .
you can see it is not animated as it is just a model with no bones .
fuck if they gave the dragons wings or turned the claw into pinchy '' and animated them it would work but they just ported them from a fucking thomas game
it 's also fine if she 's actually a good actress .
it 's important to understand that for non-amateur porn these people are literally at work .
you are watching them do their job but some of them are very good at it .
i remember that the husk of the pit was dropping earlier than bungie wanted in the trial version of the game bungie jumped on it in less than a week then it stopped dropping all together after how and bungie took like 2 months to even acknowledge it .
that bissed me off and i did n't really care who won .
hill had one fucking job and he blew it .
had he not fumbled all that other shit probably would n't have happened .
i mean i know there are problems with distribution but my water seems to get to my place filtered .
i usually drink bottled water but tap water with ice has never made me sick .
veigar does n't have stealth that is what you lack to understand .
it has been known for people to work there way across by doing small jobs for a week or 2 eg .
yeah i can see that especially with the tail .
i 'd never seen that kind of fox before googling it .
hep c but the dr says my levels are within normal range .
based purely on the chat and timestamps from yasp it does n't seem like he has all vision just '' some script that continuously checks for items .
there 's a delay between a person buying the item and getting it on one occasion he reports the courier as having the item and seconds later the hero which fits the courier getting into enemy vision before handing off the item .
i only see him calling out two wards being placed out of 12 which could easily have happened while in enemy vision .
none of the wards were countered he bought eight sents but only placed two of them both right outside radiant fountain .
tl dr from reading the logs it does n't look like a map hack but more like a script of some sorts .
while that is obviously annoying enough there 's a vast difference .
had poor almost non existent sex education when i was in high school .
i knew that porn was a thing but i could n't understand why it was still amazing to everyone .
i tried watching it and fingering but nothing spectacular happened .
then i watched a lesbian video out of curiosity i heard that even straight girls like it and realized that they were playing with each other 's clits .
it was a unique feeling like warmth spreading throughout my legs .
the advanced two-player variant was supposed to balance the base game between the two strategies .
there was a post on bgg from the designers explaining why .
id get a lot more quotes on that son .
nothing super revolutionary in what you 're trying to do sorry .
obviously its not a 2 day job but it could be done by 1 or 2 capable people in 60 days or less easily .
i 'm doing exactly what you 're asking with my hue lamps .
i have an old router that the bridge is connected to and i use my iphone 5s upgraded to 6s and ipad to work the lights .
ca n't do anything fancy like turn the lights on before you get home or any geolocation stuff but it gets that job done .
any app you use should ask you to press the 'link ' button on the bridge to connect and then you should be good to go !
alright you guys have talked me into spending a little more getting a positive pressure case instead of a passive case and going ahead and get skylake .
i dropped the ram speed down and the size to 8gb to afford this new setup .

always had oily skin then had kids and now i have dry/sensitive skin .
some concern about aging as well but not a huge priority right now .
i have occasional breakouts and am allergic to benzoyl peroxide .
i had a great routine but then the changes in my skin have thrown things off .
i was using the aloe products from the body shop for awhile and also sampled some of their nutriganics products but i do n't feel like i was getting enough moisture and started getting more frequent breakouts .
i 'm back to basics now using cetaphil wash and moisturizer and tea tree oil to spot treat blemishes .
but i still feel dry throughout the day especially in the canadian winter and get random red spots and breakouts .
or a certain brand aveeno or clinique or something like that or something different from body shop ?
i never really paid much attention to skin care products before but now that i have issues i 'm not sure where to look .
i recently entered the realm of collecting nicer automatics by purchasing a beautiful longines hydroconquest .
it 's only been a few weeks and i 'm already hooked .
just a few days ago i cleared my old collection of a half a dozen fossil watches in order to fund something i 've been admiring as of late .
i 'm looking for a clean vintage omega preferably with a brown strap but i could always change that out .
i would say my budget would be under 700 usd but the more affordable the better .

moss fought hard but was easily overrun in the end .
one could almost imagine he was reincarnated as matt taking what he did in vietnam to the next level in recent wars to perfect his art and return to make a difference against the same forces that killed him the first time .
i know this is not the case still fun to examine the differences and similarities .
even anton vs alejandro again very different but similar characters .
in an alternate universe sicario is no country for old men in a modern time taken to the next level '' of intensity with regard to mexico and crime and changes that have taken place during the passed time between movie settings .
both have the same sense of justice and pending doom .
they both struggle with their strength of good and honor in the face of mighty unstoppable evil .
they both want to fight and quit at the same time .
to drive this point home ask yourself what would ed tom do if he were in kate 's shoes ?
both have the same affinity to getting the job done .
the same core ideals at heart both love their country and are willing to fight to the last bone to win .
the only difference here is matt was able to hone his skills longer with better tools than moss had access to .
i could see moss becoming matt with training weapons and time .
we have no idea where anton comes from or what drives him but one could argue alejandro turned himself into a anton in his own right .
one that fits more into today 's modern world .
in a lot of respect they too are more alike than different .
the biggest difference is alejandro needs matt for his mission while moss was an impediment to anton .
also anton had shown zero affinity to anyone while alejandro still had threads to his former self and somewhat still leans chaotic good .
in fact mexico plays itself in both movies and is an exact continuation between both .
in both movies we are shown examples of how mexico is changing and the border states are affected .
both movies paint the same tragedy that mexico will continue to fester and america will only keep getting worse leaving us law enforcement pissing in the wind .
in fact i would suggest to watch both movies back to back i imagine that would actually flow nicely together for a complete experience of old and new on the same topic .
its so hard making gay jokes and hoping you wont get lower karma butt fuck it .
i run a autograph business and porn autographs is one of my biggest sellers .
the one thing that takes too much of my time from the business is finding good shots of the girls to have photos developed to be signed .

after a disappointing experience at my district competition i 'm here to share my deca experience .
i 'm a senior in my 4th year of deca and i made it to state all my previous years but this year was different .
at the district competition i first took my test which i felt extremely confident about and i ended up getting a 84/100 which many of you that have done deca would know is an excellent test score .
after the district event i looked at the scoreboard with the test/role play scores and i had the highest test score by over 15 points .
about 30 minutes after finishing the test i began my role play prep and went on to preform the role play in front of my single judge .
as many of you know deca role plays are weighted twice as much as tests even if you only have a single judge during your role play most district role plays are suppose to have 2 judges to prevent bias .
unfortunately i had one judge and after i preformed my role play i felt confident as i did with my test .
later during the awards i learn that i did n't qualify for state this is before i looked at the test/role play scores .
all the students that did qualify for state were from the same school .
after looking at the scores i saw i had the highest test score like i said previously but my role play was the lowest .
i ended up last in my event and was rightfully angry at the time because i went through all my performance indicators thoroughly yet the judge gave me 'below expectations ' for each of my performance indicators and even marked the same number for each of the indicators .
how could i have possibly gotten the same number ranking on all the indicators was what i was thinking in my head .
i must 've atleast done better on one of the indicators .
i thought something was up seeing as how all the students that advanced to state were from the same school .
so basically i got an 84/100 on my test which was the highest score and also believed i did excellent on my role play but my judge gave me a low score .
this ultimately made it so i could n't advance to state .
have you had a deca experience like this before ?
am i just butt hurt i did n't make it to state ?
were there any recommended antivirus i should be running on my machine ?
i have used norton on my mac for three years .
previously gmail 's spam filter had been doing great .
for the last week or two i 've been getting one or two emails a day that are about rentals or rent or collecting or paying rent .
i 've also been receiving one or two other spams get through that may or may not be related but i 'm less concerned by those .
what is making me angry is that nothing i can do will stop these rental emails from getting through .
every day new spam gets through from different names and different addresses and gmail marks them all as important .
i 'm only 22 and there 's babies everywhere it 's only going to get worse
i should n't have to mute my computer audio to not suffer from these ads .
i would n't mind them so much if i can mute them in spotify and not mute everything else .
can you only imagine if tvs were like this with commericals ?
imagine if they still played if you muted the tv .
that is not right ads should not be immune to their own site 's audio muting .
i called the manufacturer and they guided me through the threading process and showed that i really was threading it wrong !
i can check if it caught the metal hook properly by trying to tug the bobbin string .
if it comes freely i need to re-do it but if it tugs back it 's properly in there .
you were all right i just had no idea how the whole bobbin assembly worked !
i used the cheap cotton thread and started sewing my polyester lining .
i ran out of cotton thread and switched the upper to polyester all purpose thread that i bought this week .
the bobbin still had the old thread in it and it ran well .
when the bobbin ran out i used the polyester thread to refill it and the issue started immediately .
is my machine having a tantrum over polyester all purpose thread ?
would taking it to a shop be worth it ?
i changed the thread to a cheap cotton thread and it runs fine .
am i having issues with the all-purpose thread because of my material ?
i 'm using an old sheet to hash out some ideas rather than use my stash .
i have a singer machine home use shown here http imgur.com/ubw5bo6 and my problem is that the top tension is too high but i have lowered the upper tension and nothing changes..

i do not have a good story to provide but i certainly have enjoyed reading all the good stories here .
that 's when i started reading a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole .
its crazy the main character seems like an almost perfect combination of many of the people in the stories here .
an extremely obese quasi intellectual that looks down on everyone while being over 30 and living at home .
he smells and never changes clothes and constantly masturbates to weird things .
the more i read it the more i think he is the classic proto neck beard .
of course he is also portrayed in a sympathetic light and the book is generally funny and fantastic .
i 'm not sure if a book suggestion is appropriate for this sub so if it gets taken down that 's fine .
first year signing up for the subscription ... any idea when the first one should be sent out ?
getting antsy ca n't wait to have some new dead to listen to in my car .
when we started dating i starting smoking but just did n't like it enough .
i now smoke 8-10 a year ‚Äì all after one too many a drink .
he has unsuccessfully quit a couple times since then but secretly starts up again each time .
i put secretly in quotes because any non-smoker smells this kind of thing immediately .
in our previous attempts we ration out cigarettes per day and step him down from whatever his current habit is to four .
each attempt to quit has come with fits/screaming/outbursts/crying centred around 1 stepping down by a cigarette or 2 me holding firm that an exception cigarette is out of the question .
during a recent relationship review we aired our grievances .
one of mine was that given the overwhelmingly negative health implications of the habit as well as its unnecessary current and future costs i do not want to date a smoker .
i tried to avoid an ultimatum and give him time to quit again but the smoking has only increased .
now instead of hiding it he smokes directly in front of me .
we had a situation where i thought being perceived as smokers could work against us .
therefore i asked him not to smoke for 12 hours before this meeting give clothes/hair time to air out a bit .
instant stroppiness and silent treatment for over an hour .
after a few drinks he just went for a smoke anyways although without his jacket .
my first thought was that this is the behaviour of a child .
and then it hit me ... this is the behaviour of an addict .
perhaps i am over-reacting but this sounds like a substance abuse problem to me .
if the stuff controls your actions/emotions and you ca n't go 12 hours without a fix something is wrong ...
am i being too controlling for wanting him to stop smoking ?
am i being too dramatic when i see this as substance abuse ?
worst of all ... am i being selfish for wanting to spare myself from the distress and cost of what i imagine could become significant health problems in the medium to long-term future ?

with the addition of the snow biome we no longer need to go underwater for our oil or pearls .
sure some of us do for that extra farm in order to craft those ridiculous saddles that cost 3000 pearls to make but in all honesty there is n't really a reason to tame something that swims .
i myself am scared to death of the oceans in this game as they 're hard to see in and i tend to crash quite a bit nowadays .
now could we seem something of worth so we can justify taming these monsters of the deep ?
i 'm a 16 soon to be 17 high school student interested in a career in woodworking .
i do n't want to sound like i am bragging but i believe i will be able to get into college on a fairly generous if not full scholarship for athletics .
this year i took a woodworking class that most people advised me not to take since i would be with mostly students looking for an easy grade .
however i really enjoy what i do in the class .
i am one of the better if not best students taking the course right now .
if i were to pursue woodworking as a career what would i optimally study in college and what steps should i be taking now in order to achieve this as a goal .
this all started last night after a boring saturday .
i had met up with a friend who provided me with 20 mgs of the substance so i went home and took it waiting with anticipation .
after about 45 minutes i did not feel anything except a small body load so i did some research .
as it turns out lsd can affect tolerance levels of the 4 aco dmt .
discouraged i had decided to go buy another 40 mg hoping the higher dosage would be enough to outweigh the tolerance .
so 40 mg were taken and this is where the trip report really begins .
30 min in i am now seeing slight distortions in reading words on my phone screen but other than that no visuals .
bigger body load this time but still not really what i was looking for in the trip .
at this point i was pretty upset because i thought all hope was lost and nothing exciting or meaningful was going to come from my night of so far disappointment .
still no visuals except slight distortions in reality nothing really crazy .
i almost feel like i completely leave my body and have became something greater than myself .
i was in so much awe tears started pouring down my face .
for once in my life i felt like i was something much more than just myself .
all my life 's troubles went away and i just could n't believe the overwhelming feeling of bliss humbleness and just complete respect for the world we live in .
i was no longer me i was one with the world .
2 hours in at this point i wanted to meditate .
i turned off all electronics all lights and just sat in my bed trying to take in what all this drug was trying to teach me .
this is where i learned that i was living my life all about me and i wanted to change that .
i still felt like i had become one with the world and i now felt like it was my responsibility to not focus on myself but the entire world and how i could impact it forever .
i know this was n't a long trip report but i really felt like sharing .
today i no longer just look at doing things for myself .
i now want to look at how i can help my fellow man my community and our society as a whole .
to finish the night i put comfortably numb on repeat gently crying myself to sleep .
and i really could not have been happier as i found the true meaning of life .
next time you get the chance help someone out .
we are on this planet to work together and after last night i now want to do anything and everything to make sure i now live the best life i can .
thank you for taking the time to read this it means a lot .
i hacked my wii late last year but had really held off from emulating the n64 on there as i have my own with a flashcart .
the n64 shat itself on christmas eve so i decided to download not64 and booted up mario64 on it using my gamecube controller to play it .
guys i really suggest you do this it 's such a great experience .
the controller feels great everything feels just right and the c-stick is much better than the c-buttons .
not trying to shit on the n64 's controller but this was so good i really needed to let people know .

i 've been bounty hunting in my cobra to earn enough credits to outfit for exploring cruising around res for easy pickings .
during one dogfight with an imperial clipper i suddenly had an npc sidewinder slam into me causing him to explode and give me a 6k bounty on my head .
ok i thought let 's get back to the station before the po-po blow me up and see if i ca n't pay this off .
it 's just 6k what could be the harm ?
so silent running fly in and dock my ship lo and behold i have no way to pay it off .
oh bounties ca n't be paid by yourself that 's just fines .
i could leave system for 5 days but i really like this system the location of the numerous res along with convenient station placement means that bounty hunting in it is pretty efficient .
then i get what i think is a brilliant idea ...
i 'll just buy a sidewinder store my cobra and let the police blow me up .
nope now i ca n't seem to get back into the station .
they tell me criminals do n't get docking privledges and i 've lost numerous sidewinders trying to get into it .
turns out silent docking is harder in these things or at least it is to me and now i ca n't get to my primary ship .

context i am sitting for a family with 6 mo b/g twins and their 3.5yo sister .
i 'm still getting acquainted with the babies quirks and preferences .
we had a rough start big sister is super helpful we get into the groove .
its 5:30pm parents are late i 'm bottle-feeding both twins in slightly reclined highchairs in the kitchen near the backdoor .
their dogs are whining furiously to come in from inside .
me hey big sister can you help me and let your doggies in ?
i choked back a laugh and calmly said no my hands are busy feeding both of the babies .
she was already on the way to the door so i just laughed to myself .
i know this is a very controversial opinion but i also know that you will all agree with me .

this shield concept will be used in coordination with a character who loses all that he loves in a single night .
if this is something you feel you would enjoy working on i would be happy to provide the full background story about a page and a half .
sorrow 's respite is a slightly larger than average tower-style shield think roman shield walls .
the metal shield stands 5'3 and is the width of a little more than a typical strong soldier .
the front of the shield is intricately designed from top to bottom .
at the bottom is the image of a burning wooden home with three female faces distinguishable but inside the flames from left to right a widow in her 50 's a 31 year old mother a 14 year old daughter .
rising towards the middle out of the flames is a spear bursting through a muscular orc 's skull with blood splashing on two orcs one on both sides .
fading into the top lies an ominous mountain with a defiant ram proudly amidst the crag .
three tears can be seen beneath the ram 's stern eyes .
thank you in advance to anyone who may chose to engage with this project idea !
a bachelors degree is required to coach at the college level .
i was wondering for someone who genuinely wanted to go into coaching what would they major in ?
to clarify i 'm not asking for myself this thought just occurred to me .
is there a specific major that relates to coaching ?
also i think there are universities that recommend a masters degree .
graduate schools are very competitive even if your school is n't ranked in the top 10 or 20 in your field of study .
for someone whose dream career is being a football coach what would they specialize in for their masters ?
i would assume there are coaches who have degrees in fields not relating to sports in any way .

if that 's the case are spiritual beings still all carbon-based ?
what kind of conversions happen when traveling between ss and the real world ?
for that matter what kinds of changes come when traveling to hueco mundo ?
if the particle makeup of things changes between worlds how does that work ?
do human bodies that enter soul society as with chad orihime and uryuu in the ss arc get converted or are they just normal atoms in a world made of different matter ?
hypothetically if you had to explain the particle physics of bleach what would you say ?
of course i ca n't wait to walk around my room and stand on top of everest .
however once that novelty wears off and i 'm back in front of the pc playing normal games that are vr compatible will the experience still be just as good as say oculus who is focusing on it ?
i canceled my oculus pre-order and decided on vive .
i have a lot of friends over who i like to show vr and kids wife who will really enjoy those experiences only vive can master i 'm just hoping the 99 of gaming i do in my office chair will still be as epic as planned for as the standing experiences .
apparently it has different names in different language versions of the game in english it 's called black phone '' while others call it secret phone '' .
are there any i18-like translation files for the game ?
it seems very unlikely that these translations are hardcoded in the executable file .
they could be a great resource for more hints .
the fact that r made the effort to translate a secret/hidden feature of the game could mean that they also translated other messages related to the mystery .
if we find the black phone '' in a translation file we could look for other things like jetpack '' and ufo '' or elevator '' and then check how and when these strings are loaded by the script files .
edit i have found where the black cellphone '' string comes from .
used but in great shape hardly any wear on the leather at all .
so every once and a while a tv series of mine will get renamed to '' and lose all of it 's meta data .
i 've just been going back in and fixing each incorrect match but it keeps happening .
looking at the files there 's nothing strange about the way that they 're organized and the tv show that gets renamed to '' seems random .
here 's a photo of what this looks like in my recently added
part 1 serious jonathan takes things very seriously most likely due to his chivalrous nature and his strong sense of responsibility to stop dio .
part 2 goofy joseph loves taunting his opponents and is highly creative in handling various situations .
part 3 serious jotaro always keeps a stoic face and rarely smile and laugh .
part 4 goofy josuke may be kind and gentle but he also has a mischievous side .
part 5 serious giorno has a dream which he takes very seriously even if it costs him his life .
part 6 goofy ... ish she 's serious most of the time but she 's definitely goofier than other serious jojos her first impression of getting caught masturbating in her cell is quite a comedic one .
part 7 serious johnny is like the straight man tsukkomi when paired with gyro the funny man boke
part 8 goofy gappy is just ... . weird .
i 'm not a serious gamer not at all but i find something magical in the arcade genre setting personal goals that definately would cause you stress to the point of insomnia intrusive obsessions attornmenting your soul until the very moment you achieve your purposes ... that charming sensation of peace when you are seeing those numbers but is something more than points i find them symbolic almost an spiritual transformation the reward of perseverance .
you know a game is addictive and difficult when you have spent more than 45 minutes just to get one more second and beat your record ... oh the good old days of gaming ...
i will now proceed to strip and get rid of every material possession abandon my home and join the tibetans to meditate and play super hexagon isolated ... and find the meaning of life .
i 've been really into breeding and impregnation lately and would love to rp about it .
it 's a kink that allows for a lot of different types of scenes .
we 've been a couple for a long time now .
while in bed you turn to me and confess that you really want to have a child with me .
breeding is n't just fun for me it 's my job .
this can be set in a variety of settings including real life a hucow farm a new colony in space or just a futuristic society in which the male population is dangerously low .
you maybe along with several others are my personal breeding slut .
i come home and help get you bred which you beg for every day .
you awake strapped to an unfamiliar bed and see me standing against the opposite wall .
i tell you that you 're my breeding slave and that we 're getting started right away .
i 'm open to most things so chances are i 'll be down for it !
so message me with what mini-prompt you want to do and we can hash out the details .
as i said above i 'm open to most kinks so do n't be afraid to work in your kinks !
i 'm always willing to rp this so do n't be afraid to send me an envelope no matter how old this is !
congratulations to all you who have become of age !
when i think of the fact that just the other day i graduated from sakura gakuin i am amazed at the speed at which time flows by .
i wonder just how much i can grow toward being an adult by the time i become 20 .
i hope all of you new adults will have a year where you feel that you have actually become an 'adult ' .
i 'll try to be brief about our background as it 's pretty similar to most of what 's posted here we met online 1 year and some months ago and we physically '' met during a holiday trip of mine during the summer but it was tremendously brief as it was only 1 day .
after this we 've been planning my second '' visit for quite some time and i 've been saving plenty of money in order to not worry about needing anymore from anyone yet my biggest problem is that my family is not taking this very seriously .
at first they thought i was being ridiculous for wanting to travel across the planet alone to see some guy '' despite knowing extensively about him and even when they started trying to sympathize a little bit they were still strongly against it .
i 've tried speaking to them but they wo n't listen and they do n't really seem interested in me leaving at all .
they are more bent on the fact that he 's a man he should come to you first '' ...
i really need advice into trying to convince them that a i have the to go b i 'm not going to die and c they ca n't be controlling me to this extent anymore .
maybe i 'm being silly and should just buy the ticket and get it over with but i really fear that in my family that wo n't fly so easily .
i 'd like to get their support before doing anything big .
i 'm feeling stuck and i though posting this would help .

what are some examples of the the overbearing ncaa 's strange rule interpretations and quirks as well as some interesting violations ?
three oklahoma offensive linemen were self reported by ou for eating too much pasta at an event .
the ncaa said there was no regulation regarding portion size but ou still penalized them by having each donate 3.83 to charity the value for the excess portions .
nebraska qb eric crouch made a campaign appearance for a university regent and had to donate 22.77 to charity after taking a plane ride across nebraska valued at 13.41 ? !
and eating a ham sandwich valued at 4 along the way .
taken directly from the la times article another ncaa bylaw better known as the bagel rule permits schools to offer bagels fruits and nuts to athletes at any time .
an interpretation however prohibited offering spreads such as cream cheese or peanut butter with the bagels . ''
note as of 2013 athletes can now legally be offered cream cheese .
up until last year walk on athletes were not allowed to eat in the athlete 's cafeterias found at most big time athletic programs since it was deemed and excessive and impermissible benefit .
they had to pay to eat alongside scholarship athletes but thankfully the rule changed last year .

first of all this title probably makes me sound horrible and i do feel quite guilty but i just wanted to gain some opinions on this .
i began university about 18 months ago where i met emma pseudonym on a group fresher 's night out .
since then i 'd say i 've been on 4 more group nights out where she has been in attendance and i see her in classes sometimes and eaten lunch with her say 5 times .
i was once lured to her house for a 'party ' that just ended up being the two of us .
my problem is is that emma is unbelievably clingy with me despite the fact we really are n't close in any way .
in one week she invited me to her house 4 times and to go and meet her near my home once .
she acts butthurt that she 'has n't seen me in forever ' and complains that i do n't talk to her enough .
in the beginning i was having lunch with her and stuff because i felt mean saying no and really did n't have an excuse .
but fact of the matter is she 's kind of a huge bummer .
she complains constantly that her life is n't together and how it 's so unfair that she 's older than me but i 've got my life more together etc .
it 's so unfair that i 'm slim and she 's fat .
it 's so unfair that i 've got good skin and she has n't etc .
she muscles in on my wedding planning repeatedly hinting she 's annoyed i do n't want her as my bridesmaid !
and talking about how 'she ca n't wait for it ' .
sidenote i 'm not even actively planning as i 'm still in uni so it 's not like i even talk about it myself .
she does n't have a sense of humour and any time she has been on a night out she gets paraletic and has sobbed on more than one occasion that nobody is trying to get off with her .
i basically have just been ignoring her invites but she still wo n't take a hint .
i feel like i should n't be friends with someone just because they want me as a friend and if i get nothing out of the relationship .
is there any way that i can handle this that is n't going to be horrible ?
i feel like she should have just taken the hint by now .
tl dr sort-of friend is very clingy and not fun to be around .
she is not taking the hint that i do n't want to be friends despite the fact i 've been distant and ignoring her invites .

i got some heating oil at a huge discount over the summer however it smells like bug spray when it burns .
i 've had oil-based heating before and there 's always that heating oil smell so i know what that smells like .
this smell is definitely not that this smells like off '' bug spray mixed with that smell .
is it the oil that smells or something in the furnace ?
like everyone else here i 'm shocked and saddened to have learned of david 's death earlier today .
we can at least be assured that he left a tremendous legacy and a vast back catalogue but it all feels so sad .
his best work still feels futuristic and he 's the very rare artist who you just ca n't epitomise or define in a single song he 's too varied for that .
i also wanted to share a tribute written by robert forster of the go-betweens that nicely captures what it was like to be there when he broke through and when his work felt so new and strange in the early 1970s landscape http www.smh.com.au/entertainment/david-bowie-the-starman-wed-been-waiting-for-20150623-ght986.html
it was written when the david bowie is.. exhibition arrived in australia last year and i feel even more privileged to have seen it although its timing takes on new meaning knowing how long he 'd been ill .
all throughout the series there are passages from books that were written in the forth age about the dragon reborn .
i just started to listen to teotw again after finishing the series .
there were 2 quotes from books written in the fourth age about the prophecies of the dragon reborn just before the first chapter .
pretty sure this is rand that 's writing these books .
i 'm a long time pc gamer and the last console i owned was a nes around 18-20 years ago .
and on this new year i was presented with a brand new ps4 .
and as destiny was on sale and it being the most hyped game for current gen consoles i decided to get it .
so far i 'm having a blast in terms of gameplay all is fresh and interesting and aiming with a controller is a fun challenge .
after two days i 'm beginning to hit mobs rather consistently but aiming is still a great challenge .
yesterday i did a first 3 ppl dungeon '' that comes at lvl8 .
and i felt that i was useless and the two other guys did all the work .

1.what is the most forgiving weapon setup out there ?
should i git gud '' before hopping into raiding in destiny ?
should i just forget about pvp in order not to get overly frustrated ?
the last thing harald expected was a raven from last hearth instructing him to move his troops following an order from winterfell .
'do as he commands ' he told baelor 'we will see each other again hopefully . '
i 'll keep a thousand men here take the rest and go to ironrath . '
'we all do ' harald replied with a sad voice 'now go or stark will be cross . '
'you are the best bastard i ever knew ' he added 'and the best man as well .
my daughter does not deserve your fate though she deserves your manners .
'i pray i will m'lord ' baelor replied as he saddled his horse .
'with all due respect m'lord i 'm not the one who should be worrying about this sort of thing right now . '
'*if my house dies with me i will not have my keep and household fall to any southern lordling yet there is not much i could do about that . '
'and you 're right by saying so m'lord . '
'however there is something i can still do with another part of the umber heritage .
harald unsheathed watchman and made it shine in the morning light one last time .
'm'lord ... and for your trial by combat ? '
'i will not let the sword of my fore bears be melted on an iron chair .
not while i live and not while i 'm dead .
take it to last hearth and keep it safe .
if my other wish is not granted i want you to keep it as yours .
'valyrian steel swords are too dangerous for girls . '
he sheathed the sword once more and handed him the whole .
'now go to ironrath before we all start crying damn you . '
the bastard embraced him once more this time in a more gentle manner .
'i will pray for you m'lord ' he said as he mounted his horse .
the old gods have no power in the south . '
m baelor snow heads to ironrath with 1500 umber men .
1000 remain in winterfell with their still lord harald umber .

i 'm a full stack web developer with quite a bit of experience with python and javascript have been dabbling with haskell a bit as of late have some experience with lisp-like languages mostly through writing elisp for emacs etc .
lately i really have been thinking about trying android development so naturally i have to do java programming .
i do have some experience with java back from the college days but nothing too fancy i have a lot to learn especially regarding the libraries and the android sdk itself etc .
however it seems to me that i have an interest in more powerful and academic languages and java is always ridiculed in the programming language elite as such a limited and limiting language .
i 'm not sure i could cope with all the boilerplate lack of first class functions etc .
would i get frustrated having been spoiled by these more powerful languages ?
any of you doing android development but dislike java itself ?
i ca n't speak for the kalos starters as i have not unlocked them yet however .
i find it interesting that at fully evolved level there is such a bp difference between the three kanto starters and the three hoenn starters .
you would have thought that they would be equalised but nah does n't seem so
sometimes at approaching they answer this not to play with me but because they are honest and mean it .
it always comes out as a very awkward situation .
they respect my bold move to talk to them but after this there 's this very uncomfortable silence between each other .
how to farewell the person without loosing strength and keeping the mood up ?
i am not the you look like you need a second one '' guy .
i respect that they are not available and do n't want to push them to do something out of their moral frames .
i just read through the blog post and comments about this http www.cyclingabout.com/how-much-does-bike-and-gear-weight-slow-you-down
all in all it says that weight reduction does not save as much time as expected and the effect is only noticeable when elevation gain comes into play .
since i do have some personal experience when it comes to differences between different setups and weights i wanted to add my few cents .
the main difference in speed does not come from the weight savings but from the bicycle and aerodynamics/wind resistance !
a touring/trekking bike that weights 15kg and a road bike that weights 7.5kg are a massive difference not because of the weight alone but because of the rider position .
once you ride faster than 15kmh most of the energy is needed to overcome wind resistance not the weight of the bike .
weight is only important when it comes to accelerating or decelerating your bike .
you stop you start you cycle uphill you cycle downhill .
your frame geometry and sitting position are the points where you can save the most time '' gain the most speed .
also the weight of moving parts like pedals shoes and especially tires tubes and rims .
weight of the bike is also important each time you handle the bike .
less bags and less weight means it is easier to carry stairs in/out buildings sand mud
your profile is slimmer with frame bags get through smaller areas especially in traffic jams
you can take all the bags into the shop with you no one can snatch items from your bike while you go into a supermarket
i remember very fondly the times i could ride with local road bike groups in southern europe going 40kmh on my touring road bike .
same for the times when i put the bike on my shoulder and could walk/run up/down stairs without using my hands to carry it at all .
i personally think that speed is important because it has only positive side effects .
if you only have limited time you can ride longer tours and see more .
if you are on an open-ended tour you spend less time sitting in the saddle and more time interacting with the countries you pass through .
you can carry far less water/food because you come by shops/restaurants/etc more often .
you need far less effort for any mountain area .
because your bike is a lot more responsive and stops a lot quicker .
tl dr please consider more than just the weight .
of course the golden rule ride your own ride '' still applies just wanted to give my 2 cents and while i have done no actual tests when it comes to speed i did do a bit over 25 more distance on my tour with the road bike in comparison to the tours before .
ps i 'll post a tour update the next couple of days i 'm done with my visit on the arabic peninsular .
play it at 2000x speed and you wo n't have to listen to it for long .
yeah my godson is allergic to cinnamon apples bananas and mustard seed .
it sounds weird and before his parents got him tested i would have called bs on anyone who told me they were allergic to that stuff .
bullshit how come all the cameras are conveniently placed for the coolest bits ?
and at 2:10 you can clearly see other people have landed on that roof before !
this is my 3rd or 4th challenge however many there has been kind of blending together ...
i was a new years resolutioner in 2015 and began as morbidly obese on jan 1 2015 at 5'5 '' and 250.0 lbs .
i am now 0.6 lbs from being a healthy weight .
i love food hate veggies do n't exercise and probably should .
i 've been in an unintended maintenance since about october when i took a vacation and gained 7 lbs .
i went back down to 155 when i got home and i 've been pretty much been between 153-157 all holiday season long my birthday .
i am just finally dropping lower over the last 2 weeks to 150.6 which is my lowest yet .
it 's crazy symbolic to me because 150.0 represents 100 pounds lost officially being health weighted and reaching a number i never thought i 'd see in my life ever .
i was a size 20 and i 'm just about in a 6 all in a year .

i would say no and your cons against him seem to be that he stares at boobs has a picture of onodera is dumb average imo and dense super dense ?
on the pro side he 's caring kind can cook nice relatively athletic .
as a person i think he 's fine nothing really special but definitely not a bad dude .
in terms of is he a good character for the series .
the series is completely different if he is n't dense so it 's kind of a necessity .
if you just do n't like the flow of nisekoi you 'll probably think he 's terrible .
other than that he 's brave when you need him to be timid when you need him to be etc ...
in terms of why these girls are falling for him .
it 's pretty special circumstances for most of them .
chitoge they have a very common history and this is one of the first few boys she 's been around friend wise so not too far of a stretch .
onodera also has a crush on him but i do n't think onodera is rock star hot either to support my case on this all of the girls believe chitoge is super model hot and most of the characters also think marika is hot i do n't recall anyone saying that about onodera besides raku .
i do n't think most people hate him on a personal level but rather hate that he 's so indecisive and clueless .
but if he was n't the series would 've ended long ago p

good to see someone understands that murdering someone 's face off is enough to draw their attention instead of the constant bicker about there is no way to draw aggro ! ''
naruto and sasuke would destroy their kids at the same age .
now i know what 's a actively broken and b going to happen i can pace my playthrough a lot better .
my first playthrough was a mass of frustration as a bugged out questlines railroaded me into one ending that i was n't even that interested in and b i kept discovering content that would have been awesome i had found it before i became an invincible god of hyperdeath .
one time this nice christian lady comes in and asks for a brand of bread her daughter recommend called dave 's . ''
i could tell she was really put off by the killer and immediately left slightly horrified .
to be fair project managers don't need to know all of the technical aspects .
it does n't hurt that 's for sure but any good project manager wo n't just blindly do stuff without consulting the it people with the skills to do the things that need to get done .
at a place i worked in the past the project manager would get his stuff from senior management and then he 'd come to us for the okay guys here 's what we need to accomplish .
tell me what 's needed how long it 's going to reasonably take and who can do what . ''
project manager are supposed to coordinate and communicate not dictate .
especially in the winter when you want to warm up your room p
as others have said using loose formation makes the differences .
in tight formation vs so you will likely lose most of your infantry before engaging with loose formation probably only lose 5-10 or so per shot assuming they hit .
i can remember one game as goths vs celts where i was doing ok while using lose formation when i forgot to use lose formation for a group of infantry i lost 60 in a couple of shots .
do n't mind me just here to plug r/leaves as a good resource for those seeking to distance themselves from the herb .
yeah whenever a personal blame happens whether it 's directed to me or anyone else it 's my cue to mute all .
i know but right now i 'm not really interested in rttp anyways .
i 'm still in q so it 's not like i got use for the mycareer cards .
right now i 'm focusing on getting through all the domination challenges hopefully making some money when i pull a coveted card in a vip box .
after all that i 'll maybe give rttp a look-in
actually i have the opposite happen ... like i forget that not everybody grew up watching salty the songbook odyssey or veggie tales .

which is basically an intern with a less undignified but slightly creepier name .

squatch was my hero i refuse to believe he raped those women .
thats just a media smear campaign against squatch people .
the way they reacted to his polanski joke ... .

i 've known since i was little and fortunately for me i had really good bbs and chat room pals helping me figure out what was going on in my life .
even so i still find myself questioning my decisions and creating problems for questions i already have answered .
you may have an epiphany tomorrow or you may never have that light bulb click on that lights up the whole of your identity .
i 'm starting my journey late in life because i had similar feelings to what you describe for most of my life .
one way or another for some reason or other i would reset any progress i had made towards becoming a binary female and think well that 's it .
i 'm glad all that gender mess blew over ! '' .
for you for now i would recommend meditating on the daily tasks you do now but completely transitioned .
do n't be afraid of betrayal it is most likely happen to you at least once .
but find that friend who lets you be you no matter which mask you try on .
also do try to quash the discomfort of exploring yourself at home .
i 'd lived for years with roommates who were totally cool with my coming out to them but i ruined those years of my life by tricking myself into believing that i was forcing something on them and never fully assimilating in any gender .
that leads to an even more intense and emotionally draining cycle than you are feeling now .
on the other hand ... if you 're talking about exploring yourself do n't worry about that at all .
everybody knows it so hard that detergent companies are making teevee ads with mom finding protein socks all around the house .
otherwise you 're denying your parents a very important rite of passage .
so good luck keep going forward knowing that at some point in their journey most of the people here have felt the way you do right now .

lube is not there for after you 're dry or sore .
lube is there to prevent you from being dry or sore .
i have the same issue and had girlfriends feel slightly insulted when i wanted to use lube even though they were wet .
the next time we had sex they asked to use the lube again it really makes a difference on post-sex wear and tear .
a good silicone lube will last longer than a water-based one .
just do n't use silicone lube with silicone toys .
your butt has two sphincters muscles that clench it shut and one of the two is n't under your conscious control .
work your way up to cock over the course of weeks starting with a finger and adding more as you 're comfortable .
expect the actual anal to take way longer than you 'd expect foreplay keeps it interesting .
err on the side of too much lube and consider buying lube applicators so you 're getting it inside where it 's needed too .
if it ever gets painful stop and try again another day .
if drinking or weed helps you relax that may help too .
i do n't see how his fixtures are incredible .
sunderland is decent but watford and everton are n't necessary easy teams to keep clean sheets against .
its an absolutely fantastic game amazing character creation class system has an actual interesting story and dialog .
but the combat was completely and utterly boring to me having almost all of your skills have global cooldowns and that character 's never seem to really properly autoattack so you mostly rely on the skills just ruined the game for me .
that 's why he said they should n't over do it with the drinking .
keep a light buzz from a drink or two not get schwasted pounding shots and double fisting beers and strong mixed drinks .
that way you get the benefit of a person who 's in the closet lowering their guard in the case of a closeted person their straight act routine a little more but everyone is still in an ok enough frame of mind to not be getting taken advantage of or doing anything they would n't normally do .
like they would if everyone in the situation was blackout drunk or severely intoxicated .
what anconia80 suggested and what the person you saw do are different situations in my opinion .
top people in design work do spec all the time time .
just was with someone building a 20 million dollar home .
guess what all the top architectural firms in the areas did ?
they all submitted mock ups for free to try to win the project .
also huge companies do this all the time when looking for pr/marketing agencies .
the interested agencies all create plans to pitch to potential clients specifically designed for them .
i 'm so sick of this do n't do spec work stuff .
imo if all of these fiverr/spec people are hurting real '' designers so much then maybe the real '' designers need to do a better job building their brand .
even that link you posted i see that video on the page circulating quite frequently .
they are comparing b2c as the same as b2b .
in the b2b world people work on spec all of the time .
and for that matter the same goes with b2c too .
i went and got frozen yogurt last night and they let me try all the flavors i wanted before paying for anything .

bell and beth are more than enough you wo n't need shoe until you start considering getting high score .
in fact i find it hard to believe that you have difficulties that soon probably you just lack superbs .
while i 'm not really sure which floor you 're talking about since latios appears on floor 34 and 37 i can say that your team is for pvp not necessarily pve .
ironically avoiding f37 latios is easier than f34 one since there is also a griffith on f37 so if you do n't have enough leeway to let latios shoot you just need to make sure griffith has higher action than than latios when the ball leaves your backline .
her multitude of utility makes her one of the best pvp passer but she 's not worth that much in pve especially with elaine and sharr that will usually drop opponent 's dr below 0 making her penetration power useless .
moreoever her crit rate buff is pointless since pve opponent 's wo n't resist a well built striker 's crit anyway .
her speed buff/debuff are minor help since you really attempt to counter the ball after shooting .
it may be useful for the next attack but in worst scenario it will only make you use up your action bar leaving it low for next attack .
a more damage oriented passer like renee would be more helpful in pve .
always use bell and beth on the same side .
this will allow beth to penetrate through anything that can severly damaged by beth which really shortens time and cuts down any risk of losing the ball .
if you tank with isillia or bell you should be close to making a shot every time opponent does .

yup it was easy-mode for a while now it 's just not as good as it used to be .
especially as many fewer other players are going to roll out the appropriate leaders to double-up on the reduction .

a hobbyist karateka may not spar regularly but a couple rounds once a month should do little harm .
just like with krav sparring is still necessary for reliable self-defense it 's a pretty fundamental rule of thumb that should be followed .
anyway we 're not even talking about conventional practice we 're talking about making changes which would again necessitate actual sparring to identify what actually works .

america is more involved with the middle east than ever .
i 'd be interested to see if america is more involved now that it is n't fighting a major war there .
it is the dominant force in the region after being given land and told not to do exactly what they have done .
the idea that the country that had its land taken by the international community ...
far more complex than you are making the palestinian-israeli conflict out to be .
... has to then agree to a broken state solution with no defensible positions or access to proper facilities is mystifying .
not sure what you mean by no defensible positions '' nor access to proper facilities '' .
if you could please elaborate that would be appreciated .
its completely beyond logic that this is a reasonable solution .
well everyone 's come close to agreeing to it a couple times now so i would love you hear what your reasonable '' and realistic solution is .
gaddafi was fine until he nationalized the countries oil and seemingly overnight they painted him as a crazed dictator .
might have been because qaddafi screwed over bp with the nationalization and then urged opec to instigate the oil crisis in the 70s .
also did n't help that qaddafi was funding terrorism around the world .
... and used a form of direct democracy the new york times wrote about after a team had stayed for a week in libya .
because you must realize that qaddafi was a dictator and that ultimately all the power and decision-making centered on him .
for decades he was untouched and even used as an indirect ally in the region yet those choices lead to america funding terrorism in the state not rebels '' if it was here its called terrorism so they forced the government which is not as clean operating as a developed nation to start with .
this sentence is hard to decipher but i 'll try .
i 'm not sure what you mean when you say qaddafi was untouched seeing as the us attempted to assassinate him and engaged in skirmishes with libyan forces .
if you could elaborate on his use as an indirect ally that would be great .
i 'll be honest in saying that 's all i can really understand of what you 're trying to get across here .
they both retaliate to continued attacks and the clinton emails will reveal some more information about the role of the americans .
please direct me to the specific emails that show the role of americans in whatever you are talking about .
i do n't really understand why you are defending qaddafi considering you 've offered no rebuttal to my point on his complicity in attempted genocide .
do you disagree with that point or do you just think that we should n't take action to stop genocides from occurring ?
lastly if you have any evidence to back up your claim about drones not necessarily increasing under a president other than obama i would still like to see it .
personal injury civil suits are very complicated and fact specific .

i disagree with people saying bench will help you do pushups .
it will help somewhat but nothing will help more than practicing pressups themselves and doing variation/weighted versions of the movement .
before lifting i could do maybe 40-50 pressups my bench max was around 45kg .
now i 'm benching 105kg for about 5 reps but my max pressups remain around 50 maybe slightly more if i really push it however i never really train/practice them .
moral of the story if you want to improve pressups do pressups regularly .

this has been rattling around in my brain a lot lately and i 've been debating on whether or not i should put it up here .
ultimately i think i just need to get it out .
so i was about 8 or 9 when this happened which is only a couple of years after my grandaddy died of cancer .
father 's day was coming up and i saw at ronnie 's local grocery store a little statue i wanted to get ndad .
it was a small trophy-like statue of a little plaster cartoon man wearing a crown and the base said world 's greatest dad '' .
this is before they started giving me an allowance so i begged emom for the money but she did n't want to waste the money .
i forget who ultimately gave me the money but since it was all of about 3 since it was on clearance it was probably my goodaunt or my wonderful neighbor that moved away shortly after .
anyways the next time we went grocery shopping i was so proud that i could actually buy it myself .
i even wrapped it in tissue paper i was n't allowed to play with the wrapping paper and tied it up with curling ribbon and everything and gave it to my ndad that night at dinner .
when he unwrapped it i was beaming expecting him to be so proud to have the world 's greatest dad '' trophy and that i bought it all by myself .
instead he sneers at it says well i better be your world 's greatest dad .
i 'm your only dad '' gets up and walks over to the couch and tosses it into the trashcan there as he plops down on the couch and turns on the tv .
well rbn as you have probably suspected i was heartbroken by this .
i remember running out of the kitchen/living room crying and the next day my emom pulling it out of the trash and putting the statue up on the bar of the kitchen counter .
it sat there for a number of years before my emom handed it back to me when i was in highschool and asked what i wanted to do with it .
i guess only the people that have read it will know what i 'm talking about .
note this is pure tinfoil based mostly on the fact that cersei likes to burn things .
what if now that cersei is free from the sparrows she decides to enact revenge with wildfire .
she has already burned down the tower of the hand so why not burn down the whole friggin sept .
possible outcomes of many jaime or tommen tries to stop her somehow leading to her death and fulfilling the valonqar prophesy .
the fire is bigger than expected and causes the wildfire caches around the city to catch fire and burn everything to the ground .

she bought a plane ticket for a six day trip to the united states in march and needs the visa .
unfortunately she was laid off from a job the same week she bought the ticket in november but has been working a new job for about a month .
she does n't have much saved up at the moment due to her getting laid off .
she lives on her own and rents an apartment .
she has been to and from europe last year .
i was wondering if it 's a good idea if i sponsor her since she does n't have a lot saved .

i 'm kinda new to smite and wanted to ask if they are good content creators who do good guides or just funny videos for that game ?
greeting so far i only create bug and abuse report .
today i want to give a serious suggestion which some people might have told before .
first of all lol is team game which required quite a lot of communication .
here i want to suggest quick text/sentence similar to dota 2 or cs .
typing normally takes time and is troublesome especially in the middle of fight .
we can use hotkey z+1 z+2 ... x+1 etc to send text/sentence which has been set/determined either by riot or user manually .
current ping/smart ping system is quite lacking in many term .
enemies is missing this could be improve if we can mention the specific champion .
so far people just use it only if the champion is missing from their lane .
assist me on my way this might be ok but people seems mixed it with normal ping and there should be additional text to further elaborate the situation/condition .
ex do n't go until i come '' let me initiate/bait '' etc
danger red ping is quite clear to see but some people often underestimate/overestimate the situation .
some people use it to indicate when 1-2 enemy or jungler is coming .
ex danger wait until i come '' fall back '' etc
this system will definitely help especially for new player and also can be used as reminder for specific information .
do n't stand too close '' spread a bit more '' etc
in case there are many aoe in enemy team .
current ping system can point on specific champ but if enemies is in the fog/bush current system require us to explain our teammates by typing .
do n't go alone '' do n't go you will die '' get back '' enemies are coming '' etc
this might works similar with alert or retreat ping .
this one which i think the most important text sentence because losing 1 player might cost the game in late game .
people tend to keep going even after their teammates send danger '' ping multiple times .
tl dr request for additional customize able communication system .
a little while ago i told my dad in the worst way possible basically just stupid drama which is why i never wanted to tell him in the first place that i need a therapist .
so he finally got me a counselor i do n't really know the difference of a counselor therapist and a psychiatrist .
but anyways i 'm just really scared are they gon na tell my dad everything ?
i can think of a thousand other reasons why i 'm scared..
for as long as i can remember after i get attached to a girl i become convinced that she 's cheating on me .
there was 1 girlfriend who i did n't have this with i was n't as infactuated with her .
im not sure if it 's a legit fear of being cuckolded a sixth sense that they 're actually cheating or delusional jelously .
my gfs have tended to be on the dirtier/flirtier/more likely to cheat side of the spectrum .
i could be banging her 3 times per day and still feel sexually frustrated .
the thought of another guy fucking her turns me on massively but kills me on the inside .
it 's hellish impossible to concerntrate on work or anything else .
have any men been through this and how did you deal with it ?
can anyone tell me launch hours on jan 19th for eu servers in gmt time ?
i just stumbled upon this sub through r/games and i thought that i 'd fit right in .
i 've had chronic depression for as long as i can remember and like a lot of people here i have no motivation to do anything at any time .
sorry if this post is really jumbled and disjointed .
i 'm trying to combine like five different posts into one .
throughout my life gaming has been my one constant .
i 'm not going to really go into specifics but my life changes drastically every few years and i 've used gaming as my crutch to lean on .
it 's gotten to the point where i 'm obsessed and when i 'm not working or sleeping i 'm playing games .
my family thinks that it 's all i do and they 're mostly right .
i got a seasonal job at gamestop and i enjoyed it .
i loved working with my co-workers but i currently do n't know if they 're gon na keep me full time or not so that 's adding even more stress but i have one thing that i 'm looking forward to .
having milestones and things ahead of me to look forward to has always helped me deal with my issues and currently i 'm looking forward to going to magfest in february .
it 's my second time going and my second convention ever .
i 'm going with some friends from around the us specifically alaska and arizona while i 'm from louisiana .
we 're trying to make it an annual thing to do .
going to conventions really helps if you have a similar situation to mine like if gaming is the only thing you enjoy in life .
going to gaming conventions if you can afford it lets you get out of your shell a lot and it can help build a lot of social confidence if you have social anxiety like me .
you also get to meet a lot of your favorite youtubers and such and magfest specifically has lots of gaming themed concerts like the megas .
at last year 's mag i met a lot of people who were a lot like me and shared a lot of the same interests and we ended up hanging out even though we barely knew each other which is pretty much a nightmare to me but it was a great experience .
just going to one convention improved my social confidence so much that i was able to go apply for multiple jobs and get through a few interviews which is something i would have never done if i had n't gone .
it 's nice to take risks every once in a while .
even having games to be excited for is good .
i was using mgsv as a milestone for the past few years and it made it a lot easier for me to keep going .
i do n't know how to end this jumbled mess of a post but i 'd love to hear about some other convention experiences people have had .
notre dame was the only team to finish with its same preseason rank .
not counting notre dame only 4 teams finished in the same neighborhood 2 as their preseason ranks alabama michigan st lsu wisconsin .
10 teams finished ranked that were initially unranked by the preseason poll the highest of which being houston .
9 teams finished the season unranked that were ranked in the preseason poll the highest of which being auburn 6 .
so my coworker susan '' 45/f is real nice lady but can be a little loud and rough around the edges but is a great person .
we work in for a government agency in a little 15 person office .
susan does not work directly for my boss mike '' 55/m but mike definitely has a problem with her .
he talks about her to other people complains that she 's too loud when she works from home she does n't do any work and is just generally bad at her job .
he 's single 55 lives with mom will give co-workers the silent treatment makes fun of everyone when they 're not around complains a lot about the job/agency has a history of messing with people 's things at work unplugging someone 's coffee maker moving their coffee maker throwing away food that is not his going into someone 's office or desk for unknown reasons .
mike does n't have a whole lot of redeeming qualities to be honest .
i try to empathize with him but it 's hard to do when he is so negative all of the time .
i think he does n't have a lot going on outside of work no kids no wife i think he 's possibly gay .
lately susan has had things go missing from her desk important work related materials it 's obvious someone has gone through her desk .
everyone in the office has received a gift of a plant only susan 's goes missing and is later found dead .
things that seem petty but add up over time .
a superior is aware of the situation but it seems that his hands are tied without proof .
just wondering what course of action some of you would take ?
i want to set up a nanny cam but i ca n't really do that and would possibly get fired .
a mouse trap in her desk drawer is appealing right now too .
it 's not really my place to do anything either i realize that but if this was happening my wife i would want to kill mike .
tl dr my boss wo n't stop messing with my co-workers desk and other things when she is n't there .
superiors ca n't do anything to him because we do n't have proof that it is him .

a coalition of italian consumer organizations and european and u.s. trade unions accused mcdonald 039 s of abusing its market power to harm franchisees who run its burger restaurants as well as customers workers and rivals .
mcdonald 039 s defended its practices saying that the company is committed to working closely with franchisees quot so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants . ''
mcdonald 039 s exploited its position as a landlord by requiring franchisees to lease its property and charging rents in europe about three to four times higher than market levels according to the complaint by consumer associations codacons movimento difesa del cittadino and cittadinanzattiva .
two-thirds of mcdonald 039 s total revenue from franchisees in europe comes from rents according to the statement .
mcdonald 039 s contract terms such as one or two-year non compete clauses severely limit the ability of franchisees to switch to other brands preventing effective competition between chains according to the coalition .
short-term profitability is the main rationale driving franchisees to enter into agreements with mcdonald 039 s according to the coalition 039 s lawyer raffaele cavani .

if anyone has an invite spare i would be very grateful if you could share it with me .
i just recently stumbled upon this sub and love it .
i actually have n't been on the front page in days ha ha .
i started a small esxi lab on my pc i7-3930k 16gb ram but quickly realized that i will need much more memory and thus a real server .
i could upgrade to a board that supports 64gb but only thing i can find is around 400 .
i can get a nice server for this much .
i am currently torn between a xs23-ty3 c6100 and an r700 .
i would like the server to be able to do the following
emulate multi-site domain with ad dhcp dns iis exchange possibly using real hardware and/or gnsw networking topology .
i have n't worked out the exact topology for the lab but i want the machine to be flexible .
so i 'm not sure what would be the best server for this .
i would also like to be able to use the same hardware for at least 3-5 years .
c6100 with four nodes 8 quadcore 's and 96gb to start with
c6100 with a single node x7675 and lots of ram and scale the other three nodes as budget and necessity require
i would like to stay at or around 1000 max but the various 500 configurations are appealing since i would still need to buy a rack hdd 's and some other odds and ends .
i was thinking about asking digitalmind2000 to price out a four node c6100 with only one node dual x5650 or 5675 's and at least 96gb of ram then adding nodes as i can and have the need .
i could actually get two maxed out older c6100 's with ddr2 for the very cheap .
are there some other things i need to take into account ?
i 'd prefer something quiet but beggars ca n't be choosers and if i have to i will work around the noise .

i 've been starting and stopping keto for 6 months now ... which obviously means i have not lost any weight nor is my diet helping my pcos .
so i 'm back on the wagon and tracking on myfitnesspal .
i find i forget when it comes to dinner or weekends but try to go back in the morning and fill it in and trying to better in the habit .
wondering if any of you ladies would like to be keto accountability buddies or if there 's already a system for this in this sub ... let me know !
is that just a fair price or could there be profit in it ?
my clutch pedal went a little soft the other day but was still drivable .
this morning when i got into 5th on the interstate the pedal no longer had any resistance and i could not down shift until i was close to a stop .
i know the clutch itself needs to be changed .
my question is should i just change the slave cylinder or go all out and change the entire assembly .

when i was young i got damaged in my hearing due to a heavy ear infection ... well not so much the ear infection as the plane ride home after my vacation ended .
the result of that was that i ca n't hear certain tones especially in my left ear .
now normally this would n't be a problem i just turn my head slightly more so i can hear better and it usually is fine .
i still miss certain tones and people with quite high or very low voices are difficult for me to understand .
the problem comes when i try to adjust my own recordings in audacity .
when it comes to adjusting things that everyone does i 'm fine like removing noise coughs and sighs .
however when i have to adjust things that are specific to my voice i ca n't hear correctly .
i honestly ca n't hear the differences and what needs adjusting because i miss the low and the high tones .
does anyone have any advice for me or how to work around this problem ?
is there any way to get a visual indicator ?
if it 's translated into images and someone tells me what to look out for i would be fine but i got no clue what to look at .

this is a great medium format camera that handles a lot like a big slr and even has a working exposure meter and can be used with a flash .

my boyfriend 's in a very competitive grad program right now he started five-six months ago .
we only dated for a few months before he left for grad school and we were n't sure if we were going to do long distance at first .
long story short emotions were high when he moved and after a while we decided we wanted to try because we liked each other too much to let go .
this is my first ldr but not my first ltr if it counts as that at this point .
this is his first everything and there 's sort of a notable experience gap in several areas but in general he 's a good communicator kind and tries pretty hard .
he 's really close to his family and he missed them a lot this past semester so he 's been doing a ton of activities with them for the holidays .
during the past few weeks he 's had less time to talk which i 100 get but makes me a little lonely even though i 've had stuff going on with friends and family myself .
he also just got his first semester 's final grades back .
he did n't do poorly at all but it 's a top 5 program and his identity is at least partially caught up in always excelling but it 's a bell curve and everyone in his class is also competitive .
today he brought up how he 's going to need to buckle down even more this semester so he is n't disappointed in himself at the end of the school year .
i also found out he 's going to try and take a weekend to visit his family in february and i know he was planning on spending his spring break with them and part of it might end up being eaten by an important grad school event .
this is really all the travel leeway he has for february april though .
i really love that he loves his family but i took time off to see him this month and in november and i probably do n't want to ask for time off again any time too soon .
i 'm taking a gap year to work in my field and i 'm in the middle of my graduate school applications now .
my first choice is his school and getting everything done for the applications and being terrified of getting in and thereby getting to close the gap without it being some monumental life plan alteration and how i 'll pay for grad school is terrifying .
my anxiety 's been pretty high the past month or two but i 'm trying not to let it bleed too much into my relationships with people .
so far we 've always been able to plan trips two trips ahead .
he 's visiting me for the first time in three and a half days and now that i know he 's taking a weekend in february to fly across the country to visit his family who are not where i am and he 's really stressed about school he 100 could n't handle two weekend trips in a month i keep thinking about how we do n't know when the next trip will be .
i 'm just really anxious about graduate school applications because if i get into his school we could be closing the distance in seven months and if i do n't that means i 'll definitely be somewhere else for two and a half more years and he 's got two and a half more years in his program .
honestly i do n't think we could handle that for a lot of personal variables that would n't make it worth it for us .
i 'm stressed about when i can ask for more time off work without upsetting a relatively new boss .
so is currently pretty swamped with his grad school workload and kicking himself about not performing to his expectations last semester and i do n't want to put my stress on him and feel like i 'm dragging him down more when he needs to get it in gear .
this is one of the reasons i could never relate to most people .
when i was talking with other shy/socially anxious/introverted people almost all of the claimed that they are lonely and have the desire to be more social and that being alone for an extended time causes them distress and unhappiness .
when i talked with other 'odd/weird ' people they usually had a lower social-drive but they still claimed they often feel lonely and implied it 's a bad thing .
most autistic/asperger 's people has an extremely low social-drive which i can relate to but many of them still often say that they are lonely and that loneliness is causing them a depressive bad emotional feeling .
i do n't think i ever felt lonely in my life in fact i 'm the happiest when i am alone .
i only have a very few close friends who i meet about every 2-3 years most of my other friends are work/school related aquintances .
even though i have a girlfriend of 4 years who i love more than anything i was perfectly content for 18 years without any relationships .
i almost always played alone in kindergarten had only a few friends during school who i usually only met during schooltime and during summer holidays i usually was sitting in front of the computer or walking alone in the city or nature .
hell i even play single-player games all the time since i dislike being in most online communities too .
of course i have a minimal extremely-low social desire but i 'm starting to think i 'm the only one who feels that way almost everyone else claims that they are lonely or want to become more social .
do n't get me wrong i do n't have any problem with good people i just mainly like to be alone .

i want to uninstall my mcafee agent 5.0.2 and my mcafee virusscan enterprise 8.8.0 because my dat-file was not updating .
therefore my admin said uninstall that agent from my client in the epo-console .
no my client is n't visible in the epo-console .
now i ca n't uninstall the agent because my c program files x86\mcafee\common framework is empty .
usually you start the frminst.exe forceuninstall in order to remove it .
and wanted to set the 'start ' value to 4 .
i need to do that to disable the mcafee framework service which protects the agent to be removed via program and features .
appreciate your help but my admin decided to reinstall my notebook .

mickey lee soapworks mls is an artisan that specializes in small batch handmade soap aftershave preshave products bath products and lip balms.. samantha u/sammy_lee and eric mcdaniels u/mickey_lee have been occupying the artisan space for a over a year and a half now and continue to impress with their soap scents and hip style .
both are active participants in the shaving community and are easily accessible and a pleasure to speak with .
i encourage you to read their full about http mickeyleesoapworks.com/about section of their website for a deeper look at who is behind this amazing company .
with the ringing in of 2016 mls made the full switch to their vaunted special edition soap base and has added some new scents while discontinuing some of the less popular one .
for the most part i 'm looking at you souq they have done away with limited edition scents and will care a healthy standard line throughout this year and into the futue .
mls can be purchased directly from their website http www.mickeyleesoapworks.com or from third party retailers such as maggard razors http www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/soaps-creams/mickey-lee-soapworks .
as always i will provide my complete honest review and i have not received any compensation or preferential treatment for my review .
this is strictly for the community to use as a tool in making informed decisions .
most importantly these are my opinions and mine alone .
if you do not like them or disagree with them i respect that and ask that you do the same .
please note that i often review products from the same artisan and to save myself time the introduction packaging and lather may be identical or slightly tweaked .
the uniqueness normally will be found in scent price and overall .
mls cape verde comes in a opaque polypropylene tub with a solid black screw top lid .
the product weight is 4 oz which leaves the obligatory room to lather the soap directly from the tub without throwing protolather everywhere .
the top label the only label on the soap is waterproof and is very elegant .
the graphics and style have been dramatically redesigned but are still a in my opinion .
it contains the company name soap name ingredients and website address .
cape verde is offered in mls 's update base which many are already familiar with as it was once called their special edition base .
this base is noticeably better than the already very good base that mls offered .
this soap loads quickly and effortlessly into the brush and rewards the user with a very rich creamy lather that is both cushiony and slick .
the post shave feel is great as can be expected from a tallow based soap made from fine ingredients .
i have spent quite a bit more time of late with mls soaps and have really hit my groove lathering it up and dialing it in .
overall this lather has very few rivals because of its ease of use coupled with the cushion slickness and post shave .
cape verde is a welcome addition to the mls lineup of scents .
this scent is a bright and vibrant fougere with notes of orange tangerine lavender thyme and oakmoss .
the blend is a unique interpretation of the fougere genre as it moves away from the common dark sharp and earthy base .
the brightness of the orange tangerine and thyme is refreshing but still grounded down by the oakmoss .
i have found that this soap does grow during the lathering meaning the initial scent develops and presents more as it is worked up .
this scent is definitely a keeper in my rotation .
for 16.00 you get 4 oz of soap this is soap comes in at 4.00/oz .
the ingredients list is as follows stearic acid tallow coconut milk aloe vera juice coconut oil potassium hydroxide kokum butter sodium hydroxide castor oil vegetable glycerin lanolin shea butter avocado oil fragrance and essential oils .
mls cape verde will undoubtedly be a popular offering in the new mls scent lineup .
it is both unique yet traditional and will appeal to a wide variety of scent preferences .
the scent as a whole is complex but offers itself in a simple manner as to not overwhelm it 's user .
the direction mls is moving with year round stocking of their scents is also a breathe of fresh air when considering the madness surrounding limited edition scents and offerings that are often abuse in the aftermarket selling space .
if you are so inclined i urge you to check out mls cape verde it is a winner in my books .

now that the holidays are over i am feeling very depressed .
my daughter 's birthday is on thanksgiving well she was born on thanksgiving my wife 's birthday is on christmas day and my son 's birthday is on jan. 05 .

my little girl is now 4 and my little boy just turned 1 .
i am so depressed i can not wrap my head around why .
everything around my house is intertwined from the past four years .
i can not pass pictures art work look at videos watch certain movies listen to certain songs go into a bedroom or just even think about anything without totally and utterly breaking down .
i guess it does n't help that i am a stay at home dad .
it starts first thing in the morning and goes all day .
i have seriously been crying every day for over a week from when i wake up until i can finally go to sleep .
i do not do it in front of my kids though .
i feel that when we are together it is their time and not my time to be a blubbering mess .
if i feel a bout coming on i go potty '' .
i know that it is alright to be kind of sad thinking about the past but this is downright crippling .
it is like all the memories that i walk by or think about are something that i have missed and i get sad but i was there for all of those memories ... if that makes any sense .
we really have nothing but happy and fantastic memories .
my heart hurts and i do n't know what to do .
i guess i wanted to write this and see if anyone else fells or has felt this way .
my cool fire iv plus arrived yesterday and it came with the isub g. i got it all set up primed it and hit it .

i 'm wrapping up my ec-001 course and part of the last homework exercise is to find an interview three amateurs that have actually been on an emergency deployment .
i 'm having a hard time finding even a single person in any of the groups that i have connections to so i thought i 'd cast a wider net and ask my fellow redditors .
if you have been deployed it would be awesome if you could help me out by answering the following questions
to what degree did you successfully support the emergency communications effort ?
how would you evaluate your overall experience during the deployment ?
so currently a max cc can only hold 2mil gold/elixir and 10k de this increases up to 3mil/15k with lvl 10 clan because of 50 cc bonus storage perk .
my level 6 clan gets 30 cc bonus storage so i can hold 2.6mil/13k .
between defenses star bonuses and wars i 'll have that thing full in a week .
i like the idea of having a treasury '' but i plan on keeping it full and protecting my loot .
i just hope i do n't lose out on the ability to accrue star bonus/loot cart resources when my treasury is full like what currently happens if your cc storage is full and you win a war .
a simple fix to this could be the ability to transfer a portional or exact amount of resources from your treasury '' to you storages .

this is an automatic summary original http thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/11/3738107/california-legislators-methane-leak reduced by 76 .
leadership in the california senate announced a package of bills monday in response to the ongoing natural gas leak in porter ranch a los angeles neighborhood 25 miles northwest of downtown .
the package calls for changes to the emergency management of methane leaks sets emissions reduction targets for short-lived greenhouse gases including methane and puts an immediate moratorium on gas being put in any of the wells located at the aliso canyon storage facility .
to date the leaking well at aliso canyon where half the 111 wells are more than 60 years old has emitted some 82,000 metric tons of methane releasing nearly 13 million worth of natural gas and accounting for more than a quarter of california 039 s daily methane emissions .
while natural gas burns fairly cleanly it is mostly made of methane a potent greenhouse gas so unburned leaks are a significant issue .
in a section called bluntly quot the current state of methane reporting is inadequate quot the organization reports that hardly any natural gas companies report methane leaks making it difficult for regulators or investors to evaluate risks .
the epa has already drafted a methane rule that would apply only to new infrastructure and the bureau of land management is expected to begin to regulate methane leaked from oil and gas development on public lands .

then i thought i heard a fucking bear and i tried to say something to my buddy but could n't speak .
then i remember starting to get a little bit of movement back in my mouth and i felt my mouth forming the word fuck '' but it seemed like it took a minute before the word actually started to come out of my mouth .
my buddy obviously woke up after i got that out and we sat there a bit listening and eventually just figured i was hearing things .
then a few days later i read about it on here and i thought holy shit that 's what happened . ''
seems like i always have these crazy auditory hallucinations though .
do n't make daft claims if you 're not prepared to back them up .

do enough content and get nothing and people wo n't want to play anymore .
plenty of people have left the game because they felt cheated by the system and they felt cheated because they put time and effort into things and got nothing in return for it .
nightfalls with worthless rewards raids with nothing but shards stacks of engrams that decrypt into subpar gear these things push players to abandon the game because they do n't feel like their time and effort is being rewarded .
marks are one answer to that and they work great for a time .
you are guaranteed to get some and this you feel like your time and effort meant something .
but then you reach the point where marks wo n't buy you upgrades and you are once again at the mercy of rng and with no guaranteed method of leveling up you become dissatisfied .
because of one too many wasted hours doing nothing to help you progress .
long long history i still remember the nerfs to the verata skills ...
it 's a good site but it 's also owned by disney
wiolent movies programmes with a very sexual nature than showed explicit scenes .
it was the fact i was quite young 11 or 12 .
sex was n't a mystery anymore there was not muxh i did n't know about so it was n't a big deal if i did it .
i ended up getting used getting seduced by much older men i did a lot of drugs becausetv said it was fun .
i was never allowed to just be a kid .
i am guessing 0-0 with lvg saying good posession game and we should be happy that we did n't lose in 3 games .
ohh a white mage bow i didnt even think of that it would be nice for rosa and pecil
minus the boots which i found everything else was crafted .
new player and i 've recently started farming dodo eggs .
these are the easiest since they drop eggs like crazy .
something like 13 of all shits they do are eggs .
to go with the egg though you need either cooked meat or meat jerky and also a vegetable .
i just tamed a lvl 48 pteradon with kibble .
it took 11 kibble and a total of 45m .
it would have taken 3h25m with normal raw meat !
i 've got 4 medium sized plots with rockarrot in and an irrigation system .
some people argue that the time needed to make kibble outweighs it 's taming benefit but i however think that if you 're efficient then it 's a lot better .
not to mention kibble lasts days compared to raw meat which is 20m .
some dinos need mating partners to lay eggs others like dodos do n't .
dropped eggs decompose within 30 mins dodo eggs do this may be different for others so if you do n't pick them up before the times you lose the egg .
yeah when they keep you up all night or when you are on your 100th story of the night sometimes you wish you could just sancho panza the darned windmill .

isolation some would be nice but is n't necessary .
i 'll be using it in a variety of places in school at home when working out etc .
preferred music rock power/prog metal e.g. dragonforce protest the hero also listen to other bands like disturbed and the occasional house genre .
an example by protest the hero https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ar15p6afr8a it 's prog rock so you might want to listen closer to the middle of the song
improvement comfort i 'll have them on for an hour or more in one session for working out etc and general sound quality .
i 'm not really an audiophile as you can tell and i 'm pretty new to this sub so i apologize if i 'm doing it out of the ordinary .

my post history should present the fact that i 'm open enough to play devil 's advocate because the best way to approach anything is to view both all sides of the story .
i do n't work for anyone affiliated with m .
i 'm telling you from my own personal experiences .
if anything i play devil 's advocate too much and it gets people very pissed off sometimes .
but sometimes that 's also fun to just sit back and watch p
having these bssbs helped quite abit since im still quite low on hones .
bssbs as rw can really help you clear quite abit at the start
understandable as it 's making permanent changes to the body ... but op 's boyfriend seemed to be freaking out because of how her choice would affect him it suddenly made him aware that he may want children in the future .
that 's where the issue lies or so it seems .
you can find models from the dark vengance box really cheap on ebay .
granted they are snap-fit so you do n't really have a lot of customisation options but for the price they ca n't be beat .
my kind have advised yours since you were brutish apes barely able to stand upright .
when your kind were discovering stone tools we were whispering improving your techniques day by day week by week month by month year by year .
when the pyramids of egypt were commencing their construction i was there whispering quietly into the mind of the architect .
when the earth unleashes its wrath upon you my kind sit enraged at a universe that will not allow us to directly intervene will not allow us to aid our surrogate children .
when your wars have begun over pointless feuds our kind has attempted in vain to whisper into your brains to quell the raging desire for self-destruction .
it is always in vain of course even the healthiest of human minds has an unquenchable thirst for violence .
yet we have tried selflessly over and over and over and over .
we always hope that one day reason shall prevail over rage .
before we transcended physical form our computational technology and mathematical understandings were far superior to anything humans have ever understood .
and in yet another act of selflessness we whisper offering answers to your technological improvement .
nearly every advancement humankind has ever experienced has been in one way or another a direct result of our whispering .
we hope one day in the far future you shall ascend past physical form as we have .
as many species we have whispered to before you have .
and all we ask in return is for you to not ask any questions .
do not seek additional answers if the universe does not seem to provide them .
enjoy your vacuous pointless debates about what methodology of entertaining oneself is superior .
experience your vibrant colorful technological landscapes conducting ultimately pointless tasks for no purpose other than the sheer enjoyment of the act .
build your apparently massive metropolises your towers of steel and glass you foolishly believe impressive .
unfortunately for you it does not seem the human mind is capable of this .
do not delude yourself you have no escape from your condemnation .
i have already informed my associate of the need for your spiritual termination .
she prepares even now for your arrival so eager is she to begin .
from what i understand she is rather fond of thin blades .
i have also caught glimpses of candles within her malicious workshop ...
i used to keep parakeets and to have a little one like that come to visit is really sweet .
i do n't get a lot of visitors human ones anyway so it 's a huge comfort for me .

if it was working it would be a good idea to start downloading wikipedia .
oh wait now i can go to the adult video store .
hmm what would i want to download before the internet stops working ?
no he just accidentally hit then semicolon key at the end there .
i 'm veeeeery interested to get to that one .
i 've heard it 's basically a knee-jerk reaction to star wars .
i 'd have said the 29um67 if it had been covered by amd 's lfc feature but it 's freesync range is too narrow sadly .
i 've always wanted a 32 '' 1440p va monitor .
the envy has low contrast for a va and uses pwm dimming though reportedly .
on top of the processing lag and pretty slow response time and it does n't like that 's one i would consider .
you could also consider selling or swapping your 290x for a gtx 970 .
i 'd normally go with freesync but you practically got g-sync for free for that price .
i agree hotline miami 2 was a bit unfair at times but it was still fun .
the story comes down to personal preference but they 're both great .
i wonder what was stopping them from just clicking on it out of curiosity
i did n't even think about it because i have n't touched my ini 's in a while but somehow my memory patch is gone .
i re-installed memory block log which also disappeared somehow and my memory is capping at 256 .
i 'd also be interested in the setup-up used been thinking of using latts alongside mux and a kiraxhz sp ?
rent i 've estimated needing 1000 sq ft of space in the store to be ideal .
the rent for this in my area is about 8000-15,000 per year which seems very doable .
market research i will get something solid and on paper but i 've heard nothing but complaints from people in my area about lack of events high prices etc but nothing changes .
the facilities offered are none existent at the other stores .
throughput i imagine with everything here being so over priced for a very poor service in my area getting people to shop at a store who is dedicated to working for them would n't be so difficult .
if there is anything you think i 've missed please get back to me !
that 's some great form there by the girl ...
but yeah ... . not really something i 'd want on my body .

how far away were you from the macbook screen if you do n't mind me asking ?
presumably closer than you were to the live action scene you posted pic of ?
yup i think i might have been in your group i played at 02:30 game time today .
and i ca n't do any more sinkholes even though that was my first one of the day .
it also i found a reddit post from a year or two ago describing the same issue so it 's been in game for a while probably just does n't happen often .

yea indeed ... ... i do n't say one should have an equivalent to a daedric sword as soon as you get the first bound weapon specific perk ... ... but once you have invested all the perks i think it should be it .
also because at that point you have 100 in fucking conjuration and you are already very powerful and conjuring a daedric sword/bow/axe really does n't make you more strong

look if you want to go find the other ghosts go ahead but i will not be coming with you .
but as for monopoly we can play that if you want .
i like it and it 's a nice change from the usn km ijn alternatives .
a really nice change when you 're in a grind .
the downsides you have mentioned and i 'll add the turrets get blown up easily nearly every match .
and for fun i did citadel a gorbachev with a cleveland at about 8km .
as stated if you can keep yourself out of attention you can unload a lot of shells .
the trick is to use landmass to conceal or protect half yourself like in land of fire or never be the dude nearest your enemy by range as a lot of people just lob shots at the nearest dude .
the tight spread torpedoes are devastating and a very nice spread to look at .
8km is n't bad if people are coming towards you .
shooting from smoke is good times but it 's too sluggish to maneuver within the smoke .
so it 's best to slam the breaks point your bow and just use your front guns at 1/4 speed .
bbs at t6 do not insta-jib a cleveland like happens at t8 .
if you pull t6-t8 party time or t8-t10 and you 're fucked .
i tried a bit in ranked but i could n't make it work .
it has poor concealment so struggles when you 're the first cruiser spotted every match .
can easily swap a captain between it and the murmansk when you want some not so serious fun .

why is it that when a-1 makes shit like this everyone makes excuses for it but when a studio makes something like bahamut do n't recall entire name the harem airing this season everyone knows it 's bad but like a good bad ?
the only thing going for this was its ' water color backgrounds which even that is solely a stylistic preference the backgrounds themselves were just unexplained fantasy world settings .
the first couple min of them fighting the goblins and being shitty at it was fun to watch but then it transitions into such boring exposition .
not to mention that moment a little over half way through where they spent minutes on end talking about boobs was fucking stupid made me hate the red haired shit face and well all the other characters for not truly calling him out for being a dumb asshole .
seriously how can anyone stand going through dialogue like that and still think this show will get good ?
my bet is that the dumb fanservice '' like that is only going to increase from here on out .
overall found the episode to be boring and riddled with pointless shitty dialogue .
it 's like if someone decided to make an anime about the characters in sao that suck and do n't know what they are doing in fact the character designs kinda look like the one 's from that guild kirito helps out in the beginning .
i think focusing on the goblins lives would be far more entertaining than watching them moan about boobs and how bad they are at fighting .
also do n't get how they can so easily accept being brought into a new world forced to fight monsters you 'd think someone would just say no fuck that but whatever .
prob my worst show of the season def dropping it and no i do n't have a hate boner for a-1 i liked erased but this in comparison is just bad real bad .

my mom microwaved my leftover pizza with styrofoam plate .

had a little fun quiz thingy for my english class in 10th grade last question was who was the creator of winnie the pooh ? ''
needless to say i brought the book the next day and showed it to him .

i wanted him to gather up the class and said sorry to me in front of every body so they know i was fing right .
we did n't google everything at that point of our life .
best one my father assumed that since i was the first born and oldest child from the moment i had a little sister age of 3 i somehow was mature enough for everything .
anything that i did from that point on was deemed childish .
to this day saying stop trying to be cute '' triggers a massive anger and i ca n't accept people saying stop being childish '' to me .
being a rebel i am i still could n't cope with growing up .
intruding probably was n't the best word for it but what i mean was as long as it 's not negatively affecting you it 's fine .
honestly these guys are gon na regret missing him playing in his prime because they were too worried about it ending or whatever .
he 's only 31 and averaging 26/7/6 and 28/8/6 recently on great shooting ... even if he declined by a little bit ... that 's obviously going to happen as he had one of the best seasons in nba history in the 2013 season every player in nba history declined '' after their best season why bring it up ?
i doubt people were bringing up jordan 's decline at this age he won 3 championships after 31 .
this does n't happen to occur when he is deeper in your mouth does it ?
edit never mind reading further down i see pressure combined with a rough palate has already been suggested which was what i was alluding to .
i used to have this issue with my ex girlfriend especially when she attempted to push me deeper in

if by respecting someone 's faith we are respecting the person without condoning or condemning is that not a mitzvot ?
from a strictly jewish point of view there 's no commandment to respect non-jews to begin with so you certainly would n't have to respect their religion .
if you 're going to generalize and say that everybody should treat everybody with respect then sure not giving somebody a hard time about their religion would be part of it but specifically saying that judaism encourages people to respect all religions just is n't true .
if a mass murder can make a good pizza does that suddenly make them ok ?

what xbox would need is something that fills a gap in the lineup .
my example earlier was persona 5 since xbox has nothing like it .
if phil spencer was in front of you and he said he 'd go out and get one ps4 3 exclusive on xbox why would you say paragon ?
i 'd much rather go for something that we have nothing like on xbox .
an experience that you can not have on xbox since there are no other games like it .

readers are interested in the characters and the story i ca n't imagine they 'll be particularly fussed about whether the various creatures and species evolved or were created .
if you want to mix scientific theory and magic then go for it .
just make sure you do n't spend a lot of time focusing on evolution and creationism no-one wants to be preached to .
as an aside i do n't see why this is relevant
as a secular person i feel creationism does n't make sense and even though it made sense to the medieval point of view if does n't nowadays .
i can understand that view in the real world but you 're discussing a fictional setting in which gods actually exist and some creatures have been literally created using magic .
why would creationism not make sense in your world ?
try conclave and treat it like a personal challenge like melee only or secondary only etc ...

sadly dw is a player that got stuck somewhere and not able to keep improving .
he has a very bad lvl right now i 'm talking about tier 4-tier 5 .
he has the game sense and knowledge to make it up into a tier 2-3 maybe but in this game you also need to kill and this guy seems not able to perform when he has to aim .
the post is n't even about my rank at all everyone seems to think that i 'm complaining i 'm not i just think it 's crazy how often you lose players relax
how is this better than the posts it is critiquing ?
in regards to the sour bit i 've found koreans tend to be very sensitive to sour things except for things like kimchi .
so a citrusy/fruity sauce with just a hint of acid will invoke a strong reaction in many people .
in other words do n't put much stock in the sour '' complaint .
all communication we have from satoshi during his involvement with the community indicates he was a large blockist .
i think the most likely explanation is that satoshi is more than one person explaining why the person who as satoshi told hearn how bitcoin could easily scale past visa-level throughput ca n't make an appearance today and push for large blocks .
in any case if the party known as satoshi does n't want to make an appearance and be a factor in this discussion i think we should respect their wishes .
edit it should also be noted that theymos who supports small blocks and betraying the community was one of the earliest members of the community joining before hearn .

it 's just a friendly thing with u/ukulelej p i 'll be back to danved once i release my next gdu
nah it 's a question that makes total sense .
it 's to get a feel if they express the idea of how much something weighs and if they have a feel for what things might weigh like if they can say something reasonable .
to see if they have benchmark weights they can use to compare like how much a person might weigh .
then imagine if they said their dad weighed 2000 pounds more than their mom would show they do n't have a feel for a pound at all
i believe she is strong and of course i would travel with her or my mother would accompany her !
but i believe it 's better to try do something now .
i could wait till i have enough of income to support this trip but it could take longer time ... and time is up to value here .

i drove around there like 10 years ago and you know what really freaked me out ?
no one up there knows how to paint a house .
every house was like pink with forest green shutters or yellow with black trim .
if you are on a server where your only option to stop someone spamming shrek binds is to mute them you are n't going to be missing anything important .
pogba is the best i 've played against but i 've never had him iniesta has been better for me than james .
though it 's a downloadable content so i suppose it 'll follow the standard digital releases wo n't it ?
or as we call it south wales or where the men are men and the sheep are scared !
and then you rummage through its corpse for crafting goods .
i think the problem this year is that people seem to be too prepared .
the toty market situation always seemed to suprise people but every year people seem to be more informed about the events .
for example two years ago the market just crashed people thought last year it would crash again but the actual crash was the anticipation of the crash .
this year everyone was waiting for that 'pre crash ' but it did n't happen as hard because everyone knew about it .
my point is that the market is just really unpredictable and the only reason i could see bale and neymar drop is because people sell them to buy more packs but i do n't think they will drop as much .
everyone is waiting for the weekend/100k packs to buy their players so when they actually hit everyone is going to buy their teams and prices are probably going to rise again because of the high demand .
my advice is just buy the players you want if you can afford them and play the game .
as a side note depending where you are in canada weller 12 gets released once a year at least in ontario .
so many of us stock up for the year when it comes out .
keep your eyes open since you could always convince someone to send you some .
for 45 cad it is a great deal by lcbo prices .
this is definitely the magic '' pace of an rts .
i do n't know why more games did n't try to replicate it opting instead for rush supremacy .
even with less ammo t-90 's max damage output is still higher than the leopard 2a5 .
that being said if you only play pve there 's no point buying upgraded guns for both t-90 and t-90ms .
they 're necessary for pvp but only reduce your overall damage capability in pve .
the extra pen is not really necessary and the extra damage wo n't make up the 10 shells .
keep in mind that nipple pain will probably start to subside around 4-6 weeks .
also she should only have pain on latch not pain the entire time she is feeding .
if she has pain the entire time baby might have a bad latch which might need fixed .
that 's very considerate of them to pay i was under the impression that most rape was done for free .
and it was n't due to poor hygiene she just always always ate fish .
yeah it 's a bit hidden but from settings display you can set it to default or dark .
my dentist scowls if i 'm 5 minutes late .
i always stock up when h b has their penny sale !
i love the pasta and noodles would n't recommend the rice !
it has a texture like pasta rather than rice !
i soloqued all the way to global here in eu took me about 7 months .
it is way harder then playing with your friends .
whats important is that you mute anyone who talks more than they should just one call after death should be enough this is important so you can keep focus .
and your gamesense after my opinion will increase way faster if you soloque .
i 'd probably go to the zoo and animal shelters and start opening cages after breaking into home depot to get a generator and a truck for personal use .
cedars are like weeds at least in central texas .

fun fact penguins and polar bears could never meet in the wild .
this is due to the fact that they live at opposite ends of the earth .
penguins live in antarctica at the south pole while polar bears live in the arctic at the north pole .
the main reason i stopped clicking on eqd links here is that it takes so long to load .
usually i 'm upset because i think we can beat any other team in the league but the warriors are flat out better and barring a couple of mistakes we could have taken this game imo .
the thing is we now know this team can play this hard now is the time to do it consistently .
i figured it was something that was small i just could not get right .
i did n't know the positioning in the sources menu meant anything .
the problem is corrected and now i can start streaming soon .
i am 33 and forcibly retired due to disability .
i need something to do with my time and a way to hopefully make a few hundred dollars extra a month .
if i am going to be playing games i might as well stream and make new friends and have a good time .

i grabbed interesting npcs which is great but that is still i feel limited .
i do have a tax deferred tira that i rolled a tiny 1300 401k into .
i also did a back door roth last year .
putting in 5500 nets me just about 80 tax free which is n't perfect but not horrible .
1 if i go to do another back door for 2016 will i again only get 80 tax free ?
when i file my taxes or at the time i moved the money into the roth account ?
if i were to roll over the tira into my current 401k tomorrow could my 2015 be 100 tax free ?
just wanted to say 98 of the time your are 100 right ...
but one fateful camping trip my boy tyler saved the god damn day .
our only package of one pound bacon was in the process of being cooked .
that sizzling combo of bacon fat and protein permeating our nostrils was finally nearing its beautiful completion when some asshat put the pan to the edge of the camp stove to cook some horse shit scrambled eggs and what happens ! ? !
the pan knew it was so god damn important that hungover day that it defied the laws of gravity and decided to fall in slow motion so that the godly hope that some heavenly angel would save the camping day breakfast .
without a hesitation fucking tyler reached his hand out when the pan was at a damn 80 degree angle to the dirty earthly ground .
the gov thinks they know russia was ready to launch some nukes ! ?
the fucking bacon was about to hit the fort .
real life was happening not your bullshit hypothetical end of the time its 1145 on the doomsday block .
that sweet heavenly angel grabbed the handle and precisely used the pans time manipulation to turn said handle catch all the bacon and the delicious liquod bacon flavor in one fell swoop without losing a drop .
this is n't necessarily justification and you make a valid point .
probably the reason an effect like this has never seen print .

yeah i 've been wondering what else i can feed her .
currently i feed her either a snail or a thawed out bloodworm which she 'll nibble on but not enthusiastically eat .
i 've wanted to breed another species of snail for her to eat such as ramshorns but i have n't found any .
i 've heard about culturing freshwater amphipods too but i have no idea where to find them either .

last place i was at had a bunch of enterasys gear in older parts of the campus when i started it became my responsibility to handle all the rmas because those things were dropping like flies .
and handling rmas involved more than just opening a case providing info and waiting .
i had to keep following up repeatedly and once i waited 2 whole months for a replacement unit !
and in that time they sent a product that we did n't even use as the rma replacement .
uhhh yeah sure let me slap this wlc right in where that 48-port switch blade was .
also got several other rma units with physical damage packed in perfect-condition boxes .
i was so happy when we replaced all the enterasys gear with cisco stuff .

i am sure that the devoted fans are also sick of the glitches and have taken a break as well .
but your point about them not touching the game right now could n't ring more true .
the crucible is clearly broken and in desperate need of a fix .
i am also nearing to the point of not touching the game until they fix it .
this kind of feels like counter-strike surf/bhop meets mirrors edge d i 'd play this for sure !
how about you actually help him try to fix the problem ?

my dad 57 as of last week 5'9 '' used to be 5'10 '' mexican a bit fatter than he should be but he 's also a bricklayer 40 years so he 's incredibly strong as well .
he never played any sports in high school but he got in lots of fights well into his 30 's .

round 1 i might have to give it to my dad .
i do n't know what your dad does for a living but my dad 's job requires a fair bit of physical effort .
he 's pretty tough and a bit bigger than your dad .
your dad has some combat training but my dad 's not exactly a novice fighter .
round 2 if we say they were at their peak in their early 20 's i think your dad would have a chance .
they 'd both be in better shape than they are now .
my dad would still have reach but your dad is pretty well-trained and the size difference would n't be enough to negate that .
round 3 my dad 's chess skills suggest he might be smarter than your dad .
your dad went to college though so it 's hard to tell who is smarter .
if your dad is smarter and he can beat anyone smarter than him he gets it 10/10 .
if not i think my dad would win 6/10 .
he 'd just throw something huge at your dad and crush him .

is this true or would my computer be fine ?
i unfortunately do n't know much about pcs so i ca n't really explain what my graphics card etc .
i presume that the game has a story that it follows and i 'd prefer to start on the first game but then again if one of the later ones is superior then should i perhaps get that instead ?
finally is there anything i should know about the game before jumping in gameplay-wise or other ?
i know the game is about as forgiving as a rocket to the face but if you have any tips on how to survive a couple minutes i 'd greatly appreciate it .
thanks in advance for any information you give me !

i was wondering if any of you remember having similar pains ?
i do n't want to be dramatic but i also do n't know when to worry .
i feel like this is just normal stretching of the uterus but this is the furthest i 've gotten in pregnancy before so i have nothing to compare the discomfort to .

washington president barack obama tasked vice president biden to run quot mission control quot on a very personal mission for him a quot moonshot quot to cure cancer which killed biden 039 s son beau earlier this year .
quot last year vice president biden said that with a new moonshot america can cure cancer .
last month he worked with this congress to give scientists at the national institutes of health the strongest resources they 039 ve had in over a decade quot obama said to a bipartisan standing ovation one of the strongest of the night .
quot tonight i 039 m announcing a new national effort to get it done .
and because he 039 s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past forty years i 039 m putting joe in charge of mission control .
for the loved ones we 039 ve all lost for the family we can still save let 039 s make america the country that cures cancer once and for all quot he said to another rousing cheer .
biden 039 s elder son beau the former attorney general of delaware died last spring after a long battle with brain cancer .
but it 039 s also personal for nearly every american and millions of people around the world .
we all know someone who has had cancer or is fighting to beat it .

i just finished a toque and realized i forgot to use a smaller set of needles for the ribbing .
now it 's really loose and it gets looser the more i wear it .
the only way i can think to shrink it is to get it wet and put it in the dryer it 's 80 pure wool .

if the game bugs out saying you 're at max runes when your hero is n't pick some mats and click charge anyway .
it 'll go through and fix the ui issue .
for so long i thought a couple heroes were just permanently stuck and unable to go to 50 lol ...
accessing the rune page after opening other ui is still broken always requires a relog to fix .
i 'm fairly new to pc gaming so please forgive any ignorances or wrong terms i may use .
but i 'm looking for an open world i think that 's the term where you do n't have to collect stuff .
i really like large world games but most of the ones i 've played fallout 4 witcher 3 i felt like i spent half of the game looking at the ground collecting stuff .
gta v and just cause 3 i enjoyed very much as there was n't any of this .
so any games similar to those you could recommend would be great
did n't really think about it but showing that is really interesting .
edit also interesting that swiftness boots is quite popular in game 1 .

i 'd like to use two full hd screens or maybe even 1920x1200 .
and i wonder if the i3 and the intel hd graphics 5500 can handle it .
it would basically need to run a text editor on one screen and a web browser on the other .
i hope someone here tried something like that and i 'd like to know your experience with it .

side-note to future readers i did complete poe 28 before doing the mission as well
it all started with me looking for something in my wall unit when all of the sudden i saw a couple of video tapes that were foreign to me .

along with that there are also a couple of older porn magazines .

1 let 's check if the inequality holds for n=1
2 suppose the inequality holds for some n i.e .
3 let 's prove that if our assumption is true then the following must also be true 2^n+1 n+1 2 2 n+1 2
now we have to prove that 2 n^2 2n+2 n+1 2 2 n+1 2
n is in the interval infinity 1 u 3 infinity
so from this last inequality i got that our statement 2^n n^2 2n+2 is not true for n=2 .
would someone care to explain what 's going on here ?
this is more of a general coding question i guess but after reading a bit i 'm still kind of confused about ides and distros .
i 'm currently looking at 2 things pycharm and python x y .
the way i see it pycharm is where i am able to visualize and write my code but pycharm itself does n't get into the compiling and package business .
and python x y has some libraries/packages/whatever already installed so it does compiling and package business .
but it also does the visualizing and writing code stuff as well .
and if so could i use the compiling and library aspect of python x y but the text editing aspect of pycharm or sublime ?
i 'm asking because i was looking to try out scikit-learn http scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html but i could n't get the regular python installation to install numpy and scipy .
i want to start off by clarifying i do not myself have autism or know anyone directly who does my only knowledge comes from reading stories and articles and a few basic explanations of autism from high school psychology so if this idea is absolutely stupid then please let me know and why so i can better understand .
i came across an idea when i saw some information on microsoft 's project oxford https www.projectoxford.ai/emotion and wondered if it could help people who have trouble interpreting emotions and subtle social queues in others which is meant to be something that occurs with autism .
the basic premise would be that someone who has as can use a piece of technology that is/is similar to google glass with implemented software that picked up on facial patterns/tone of voice/body langue to interpret emotions of other people around them .
microsoft 's software could be used to interpret facial emotions i 'm sure there is similar stuff for voice and body language if not then developing these would be part of this project .
for example of how it could be implemented a colour scale could be used to simplify emotions and a legend could be used so hopefully if the technology worked then an example would be that the top left corner has a circle which changed colour based on the person in focus 's body language angry red blue sad yellow happy etc etc .
obviously the emotional spectrum is a little more complicated but perhaps there could be indicators for more subtle things like sarcasm or encouragement too .
there are some assumptions that i 'm going off and these are
that people who have autism actually do have trouble interpreting these things
whether seeing what emotion others are displaying would actually help understand it
confirming or rejected and commenting on those assumptions would be helpful .
otherwise any feedback on the idea or the premise would be extremely helpful as well .
i 'm not ruling out the idea that i 'm a less-then-stellar streamer but i just lost about 30 followers in the span of five hours dipping my count from 410 to 380 .
i noticed the counter was acting a little wonky earlier too so maybe it 's twitch that 's messing up .
i 'm just curious if anyone else has experienced this issue within the past 24 hours .
if not then maybe my initial claim is n't too far fetched !

starting from about about 1.5 months ago i started crashing in an online game path of exile with an initial error message of visual c runtime error '' and then some personalised error for the game .
however i also started getting these runtime errors in some other games such as ys 1 2 chronicles and revolver360 re actor which leads me to think it 's an issue on my end .
what i have done is uninstall then re-install all of the visual c redistributables found on the microsoft website from 2005 to 2015 in both 32 and 64-bit .
but i am still getting errors every now and then .
i have also done a sfc scannow and chkdsk but nothing has changed my situation .
also since all of these games are on steam i have done a file integrity check but nothing was found .
my specs are windows 7 professional 64-bit intel i7-4790 16gb of ram radeon hd r9 270 graphics realtek hd audio .

i do n't understand everyone is just saying its a business '' in response to any post questioning an oceanic server but so many other games actually have them even small new or even indie companies .
this is my first post on this subreddit and i thought i would share a few things i 've learned about myself this past week and offer help to those that need it .
my name is austen rodgers and i 'm a self-published author and love gaming .
this last weekend i felt more depressed than i have been in a very long time .
over the past month i 've hardly been able to write 2,000 words in that time really low .
this built up to the point of this last weekend where i was right at the precipice of giving up on everything .
i 'm in my last year of my bfa and will have to begin making payments this next year so i 've had this increasing pressure to work at my day job more and begin making payments .
i bought life is feudal and in a matter of three/four days i put in 38 hours of game time gave up even trying to write and decided to myself that i was no longer interested in pushing to begin planning my wedding do n't get me wrong we have no relationship problems we 're just broke and i 'm tired of waiting resulting in my 'give up ' attitude .
i have this one project that i started working on in july right after the release of my first book .
about a month into it i gave up on it feeling that the piece was too complicated for my own skill and i would end up screwing up what i believe to be an amazing story .
so add that feeling of failure on top of everything .
it is completely stupid of me to have ever given up on that story .
i 've heard it time and time again just write it there is always another draft to fix your mistakes . ''
yet i seemed to have forgotten that piece of advice these past months .
knowing full-well that i have incoming student loan debt i decided that i 'm going to go down swinging .
i hate my day job it 's monotonous and boring .
even though the risk of no return for spending this next year working on this book from scratch is so high i refuse to walk down the path of using my degree to get me a job for someone else .
even if it means that i end up being financially screwed .
i 'm now on a good pace to have the first draft completed by the time i graduate and loving this revitalized surge in creativity .
i 'm not stressing myself about following all the industry standards i 'm just writing it how i want to and not panicking myself to oblivion .
we all love being taken away to some fictitious place and away from our problems .
sometimes we need it desperately to get through the day .
i 'd like to offer those of you fighting depression a copy of my book i know it 's not a game .
but hopefully i can give someone some respite in the most personal way that i can .
you can find my novel here https www.goodreads.com/book/show/24598744-the-book-of-a-few and you can pm me your address if you 're interested .
i 've also just began playing some swtor on the jung ma server if anyone is interested in playing with me .
tldr realized that my low self esteem resulted in me holding myself back and spiraling into a heavy gaming binge .
want to help others by giving away copies of my novel .
hey guys im still learning how to program and i 've came up with this simple simulator .
i created this just to see how many tickets it would take to match all 6 numbers in the power ball lottery .
what are some ways i can do to improve it ?
i could n't figure out how to generate numbers without repetition correctly so what i did was load an array with numbers and then shuffled them .
the program works when the while loop matchcounter expression is set to 5 or lower but when it set to 6 it never completes .
maybe cause the probability of getting all 6 is so high ?
cout match all 6 numbers and win 1.5 billion dollars ! ''

it 's not like she wanted to use it anywhere near school .
she was afraid of her skills which she only had showed zoe .
but she seemed very happy about her singing and playing skills .
one way or another zoe 's critique even if greatly appreciated and really important to both her head and her heart was not enough to get a true metric on her progress .
to show the world she could play instead of simply being able to brag about it .
she did n't even believed that such things were to be interpreted as messages .
i used to think that i knew you but now i do n't know anymore
she liked the song but still wondered why that song appeared on her mind .
she found herself in front of the fountain and decided to sit on it .
but she did n't need to use her phone anymore and soon enough everything sounded in key .
she began to pluck the chords quickly matching them to the key of the song she had in her mind .
she began to sing https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=nijwsmymhsm escaping the song trapped in her mind to the world .

they argue that a bottom in prices won 039 t be in place until there is a lot more pessimism and despair among gold-market participants .
consider the average recommended gold-market exposure level among short-term gold timers .
the occasion for this big jump was a rally of over 40 in the price of gold bullion which was enough to persuade long-suffering gold investors that happy days were here again .
as i wrote a month ago when i last devoted a column to gold-market sentiment a more enduring gold-market bottom isn 039 t likely to occur until the gold market timers quot throw in the towel in a big way and then remain stubbornly bearish in the face of the initial rally off a low. quot notwithstanding the past month 039 s volatility of course gold today is virtually unchanged from where it was when i wrote that month-ago column .
they analyzed gold 039 s historical behavior during periods of inflation hyperinflation currency devaluations geopolitical chaos and so forth and found that during those periods gold just as often fell as it rose .
gold traders 039 arguments to the contrary are therefore just more evidence of their eagerness to turn bullish .

i have heard that the cumulative effects of meditation over months are more considerably than what would be the result if one were to meditate sporadically and without consistency .
essentially if you meditate day after day over the long term the more pronounced the effect .
the calm '' or zen '' state you would get that lasts for say 4-8 hours after meditating becomes more of a permanent resting state .
so i would like to know if you have noticed a strong changes when comparing your mental abilities and focus from when you first started meditating till now .
i am posting this in r/nootropics because i am more concerned with the mental enhancement side of meditative practices .

to those who 're not familiar with the paper towel analogy http vitals.lifehacker.com/the-paper-towel-analogy-explains-why-weight-loss-is-a-1733478690
called the paper towel analogy this is a brilliant way to really put the whole process of weight loss in a great and healthier perspective the lesson to be learned is that fat like paper towels comes off in sheets .
and when you are big around that fat is spread over a much larger area just like that outside towel sheet .
the closer you get to the lean you the more each lost pound of fat shows because it is spread over a smaller area .
while the outside sheet may only cover 1 layer of the roll the inside sheet may go around 4 times .
that last sheet looks like it gives you 4 times the results of the first sheet but in reality the results are the same your perception is just different !
after going through my older progress photos i noticed that the analogy holds true for me in a real way .
i still looked rather fat for the first 6 months or so but all of the sudden it looked like i shed most of my weight towards the last few months .
which i know is n't true as my rate of weight loss has been steadily dropping off since i started .
so here is the gif of my 92 lbs lost over 10 months http imgur.com/myk7cin
i 'll be posting new progress pictures once i get to my next goal which should be around the 1 year mark

i have been thinking lately the problem of evil for me is resolved through god 's mercy in the afterlife and triumph in the second coming but what about the problem of hell ?
do humans who commit finite sins really deserve infinite punishment ?
is the existence of hell compatible with the idea of an omnibenevolent god ?
i know some bad people really deserve punishment in the afterlife but should their punishments be eternal ?

i used to be a christian from the age of around 13 to the age of around 22/23 i was a christian .
i am now 26 and have really started to look at things and question things rather than simply having faith .
i think it 's important to intellectually understand things and have a solid grasp on what you believe and why you believe it .
while i do n't think you can get the answer to every question you 'll ever come up with i found the you just have to have faith '' response i got from pastors and other christians a little patronising .
after doing some studying and research i have some huge issues with the trinity for example early believers did n't understand the concept of the trinity and i do n't believe jesus taught about a triune god .
jesus himself professed the jewish shema which says very clearly god is one .
i can understand people stating that the trinity also believes in one god but three in one persons but again from my interpretations of jesus ' teachings he never clearly got at this anywhere .
like i said the trinity was n't a wide spread belief amongst jesus ' followers or early christians .
i also strongly believe god is never changing he remains the same yesterday today and forever .
a reoccurring theme of god 's nature is that he is very clear about things .
he does n't leave confusion for his followers he is n't mystical he has communicated with his creation clearly throughout the whole bible .
i believe if god wanted us to believe he was a triune god he would n't let a detail like this be left open to speculation or debate he 'd make it abundantly clear .
looking at how jesus prayed and asked that the cup he was given be taken away from him how he stated that no one but god is good so why call him good all of these statements and actions clearly tell me that jesus never implied to be god .
i believe in god and i love god i believe in jesus and love jesus but i ca n't not turn my back on the clear evidence that is in front of my eyes the trinity is a huge huge problem for me .
any help advice or words of wisdom would be much appreciated .
when i go into my lys and buy yarn the owner winds it for me .
the ball of yarn is perfect tightly wound stays wound while knitting beautiful .
when i go to my favourite yarn store about an hour away with gorgeous yarns and colours i usually end up winding the yarn myself because the store is so busy .
my yarn ends up being gross stringy twisted parts and pieces everywhere .
i do n't know what i am doing wrong .
the farther away yarn store has given me multiple tutorials .
i 've cut the ties and such off properly under close supervision .
i 've wound at least 25 balls of yarn and they are all quite embarrassing .
therefore my question is ... what techniques lead to a delightfully wound ball of yarn ?

the funniest thing had been how serious they were .
sure i 'd murder someone every month yeah yeah .
and then as the minutes wore by i realized that they were actually serious they meant it .
the funny part this time had been in that they actually took it seriously .
not that it was n't a serious subject but that they were actually worried about being caught .
they were actually worried about some sort of washington post expose with murdergate headlines .
i was part of the 1 of the 1 receiving millions every month on royalties on my patent rights alone .

it was impossible for me to run out of money unless i assigned the task to others it was impossible for me to spend more money than i made .
of course the president wanted to be my best friend every political figure everywhere wanted to be my best friend .
so when they told me that i had to murder someone that there was actually this mystic importance placed on it when they showed me data when they got serious about how important it was that i kill and not get caught or the supernatural don't-break-the-masquerade police would execute me on the spot i could n't stop laughing .
once i got myself under control i placed a few calls and made a few donations .
i now own the largest nonprofit abortion clinics in every state .

i 'm not very good but that 's why i always have a couple surgeons standing around ready to go .
i now get to murder many someones in every state every month .
sure it may not be murder as far as our legal system goes .
the women whose babies i abort actually invite me in and shake my hand afterward thanking me .
but the justicars who police my ever growing capital have n't adjusted with the times and abortion is still technically murder .
they 're also bound by the laws of the land and ca n't execute me on the spot because what i 'm doing is perfectly legal and they are lawful to a t. i do the crime all the time by their rules but never have to do the time by our rules because even when they catch me red-handed i 'm not technically red-handed .
i actually stuck my tongue out at a justicar yesterday .
the young woman asked what i was doing and i made up some pithy thing about sticking it to the imaginary man who wanted to hold her down and not let me do what i was doing .
i wonder how much more fun it 'll be when i get one of those women alone in a closet and strangle the life out of them ?

i do n't mind slow starts but i think most books start a few chapters earlier than they absolutely need to and i often keep a notepad page in books i 've read detailing what chapter i think the book should start at for when i re-read it .

they do n't roll their eyes and say that my music sucks .
they also like diverse types/genres of music and i 'm proud of them for that because they 're not getting themselves locked into a rut of the same ol ' same ol ' .
probably my biggest influence on them as far as musical tastes they 've all developed a taste for a wide range of music .
of course my oldest daughter she 's 28 has much more similar tastes to me than the rest of the kids but i think that 's because she 's been around me longer .

i 'm too broke to go to an appliances store .
we found a dryer in our price range that was listed as being in our town .
we have one fast food restaurant a post office and that 's about it .
my so 's family is all from here originally and they 're pretty well-known .
so my so calls the guy who posted the ad about the dryer .
guy points out that it 's in our town so you 'll have to come get it .
so laughs and says ok because we live here too !
that starts a conversation on who my so is who his family is and where he lives now .
when my so mentions his dad the guy says oh i know him !
suddenly he could deliver the new dryer and agreed to take the old one away for us .
all because he found out my so was a local and had a nice family .
i 'm thinking i may go that route although i have ridden a couple times in one and do have a bit of a 'butt feel ' for how the power and chassis handles i do think it 's possibly a good idea to get used to rwd at the limit with less power .

i feel like i 've been doing this for the past 3 years let alone 3 months ..
to be frugal/broke but also interested in fashion/high quality items ... is a conundrum .
i always use the spinrilla app as you can download most tapes for free and play them without wifi or service but this looks like it works just as well .
does n't lower prices only make things cheaper to make ?
that does n't necessarily translate to lower prices for the typical consumer .
that 's what rob schneider said when he saw her too !
i had a wagyu steak at that killen 's spinoff that i still masturbate to .
today is my ninth or tenth day of keto and so far so good !
diet usually effects my mental health too and it did at the beginning .
for the first three-ish days i felt cranky and hungry and angry .
i think starting about yesterday or the day before though zero anxiety .
well i mean the thoughts are still there but i rationalize them better so they never escalate to unbearable .
and this is coming from someone who has the worst driving anxiety in the world .
even my boyfriend has commented on how well i 'm handling myself lately !
if it feels worse at first drink some broth handle it and push through .
you should find yourself way better than you were even before the diet in five to seven days !
yeah i really think this would be clear to anybody who ever completed the pensacola then played no
i think it exists but i ca n't remember the title .
the 20 off deal was announced yesterday or at least i saw it yesterday and i went ahead and ordered one .
they may have however sold out in the past and restocked .
point taken though i disagree a bit it would just get into a big fat nerdy semantics and this movie did that type thing if i went any deeper
that said i thought light sabers existed so you could do a bunch of aerial cartwheels and spin them around like you 're at a rave ?
a glorious contest to for me to be entering !
they 're starting to turn into that crazy ex-girlfriend no matter how much you try to avoid them they keep following you and asking you to follow them and then when you get to a station just hear me out '' .
a lot of arrested development folks involved and it did have the same feel its even narrarated .
cant get your hopes too far up tho ... its definitely nowhere near as good as ad but worth a watch if your a big fan .
well they did lose a week ago to the st .
even though this track is n't that impressive to me it 's still a breath of fresh air to all those stale pop ballad edm dominated tracks on the chart .
instead of inviting who 's who keep the wedding simple and invite only the extended family members .
instead of having multiple functions try to have all of them on day followed by a simple dinner .
you can buy simple wedding dress sari and suit instead of designer lehanga and sherwani .
yea well using the shell is faster and involves less risk but i know there is multiples ways .
not as many though after i changed it to v3
because some people are n't massive whiny shut ins who 's only source of satisfaction is dicking around on the internet all day every day .
i will be working all over town so proximity to a freeway is more important than actual location .
i 'll have to check out centennial hills though and i 'll pm you when we get closer to moving and/or taking a trip to shop around !
the best way to play beat hazard ultra is on the highest difficulty .
wikipedia is n't shitty when it provides good links .
i 'm not saying that you 're lying when you claim to have somehow read about the genocide quite extensively '' yet somehow missed the part about who did it but well actually that 's precisely what i 'm saying .
you 're lying about one of those things at a minimum .
i read about the genocide long ago but i only learned of a movement called the young turks and their role much more recently .
and i know many middle easterners who are even more ignorant of their history then me .
thus it does n't strike me as wildly implausible that cenk did n't quite realize the young turks role in the genocide until it was too late to rebrand .
the word young turk has always strongly referred to a young insurgent member of some movement or a group .
it has a broader meaning independent of the history of the actual political movement called the young turks .
given this reality i do n't hold it against them if they wish to keep to the name
the fact that you feel the need to immediately embrace the most uncharitable view of cenk tells me that you 're not really worth talking to .
scroll up to the comment that you 're replying to and click the link that i provided there which contains his actual words that say things like again the claims of an armenian genocide are not based on historical facts '' .
i have n't seen anything from cenk that would even remotely suggest that he denies the genocide today .
in fact from what i remember he has changed quite a bit since 1991 including leaving the republican party .
i mean the word young turk does n't appear in his piece from 1991 so i would argue it supports my argument .
can you actually tell someone to call a judge during their match ?
how should a bystander respond to situations like this i heard it 's different for competitive/professional rel
rare supply drops are better so why would you open 20 commons ?
hi myoginightkids this is posted on all fanart submissions so if you 've already done what i 'm about to ask please ignore me !

or i dunno dual azures at the very most ?
he treated all of the other scienctists like children who could n't handle the secrets of the destiny
rush has an ego the size a small planet and it would n't surprise me if he does n't even consider the likes of carter or mckay to be on his level .
he 's a card-carrying genius and a true genius can often have some strange quirks .
sauce i 've known a few smart people that have been rather ... odd .
definitely agree with you on matt and chloe though not completely on tj .
she 's at least able to bring a few decent scenes to the table whereas matt and chloe are just sort of ... there .
and the few times they 're given a reason to be more than just there the actors were n't .
we probably could have gotten as much out of mannequins and just letting them phone it in .
and unlike those two at least tj 's character had a reason for being besides just ... there .
and yeah the other scientists were well-played for the most part .
to be honest top spot on the show for me was a tossup between rush and the team of volker brody .
those two were usually pretty good together and easily believable characters .
the only real reason i ended up going with rush is because i usually enjoy carlyle 's roles when i run across them .
once he got comfortable in the role of rush i think he did fairly well .
at least within the confines of the writing and direction he got .
greer almost always seemed kind of 'meh ' to me .
he was n't a bad character and he does have his good and bad scenes but he never really stood out to me .
everyone knows him he 's on the show regularly and we 're never really given a reason to overly like/dislike him or root for him over anyone else .
i just got off work so my brain 's a bit sleepy .
thank you so so much for this input to process later !
if i win the powerball i 'll give you a stupid sum of money .
e oh yeah i left a trailing 7 where it should n't have been .
well she could 've let them go up for adoption because she realized that much like op she has a dislike of children and had zero plans to ever give up her own life or make the sacrifices necessary to properly raise another human being .
her family likely would 've completely flipped their shit .
it does n't mean this is what she wanted just that she decided not to hurt the children or her family members any further in a time of family crisis .
lots of people are terrible parents but it is n't because they wanted to be it 's because they are human and have weaknesses and flaws and most of them regret it later but ca n't change it .
point blank do n't judge op or his girlfriend .
look at the real world and what could actually happen instead of putting rose-colored glasses on and making broad generalizations about their options .
if some asshole wants to pretend he 's a murderer let him .
in a just world none of those monsters would have returned from the fucking desert .
wait you 're saying it 's not cool to tell people you dated that you did genuinely like them and they mattered to you ?
coming from using the nike running app i agree voice feedback would be nice .
although after my first run i rather appreciate the gentle vibration feedback every 1/2 mile rather than the interruption of my music .
though it would be much better if we could set the intervals for updates like on the nike app .
right now the built in app is superior to any i have found on the play store but i can pretty much assure you nike will update their app soon to support wear and we will have spoken feedback .
they 've already made a compatible app for the apple watch .
i would imagine with the release of the 360 sport nike 's android wear support ca n't be far away .
also check my post above for a possible fix for the audio streaming issue .
as the post said 1900 2200 gmt 1100 1400 est .
if you live somewhere else i can only reccomend using an online time calculator to check what time it is where you are !
also i would like to apologise i had a lot to do last night and in the midle of everything i totally forgot to send you a message on xbone but i havent forgotten about you !
i get about 30 mins free time at lunch so if i get the chance then ill drop you a pm .
for the record we got as far as hm oryx last night and our lowest level friend started at 302 is now 308/309 ll i would like to thank one fo the puggers last night for her outstanding performance !
i wont be posting her name here as i have not asked permission but she was a wonderful puugger !

he filmed a vine of himself pouring milk on his head .
also it was the middle of winter in pennsylvania so the milk was cold and his home was cold .
so to make things better he heated the milk in the microwave and burnt the top of his head .
does the game still rely on crit damage and crit chance ?
i feel like the gearing became tedious because of all the crit items you have gain and roll .
i do n't see any difference in ambient display response .
but i noticed that the screen is taking waaay more time to light up and unlock when i place my finger on the sensor .
as a complete layman when it comes to computers i found this helpful and informative .
some videos i 've watched are just complete borefests to watch but personally i think this was quite good !
definitely helpful for those who do n't have a clue about building a pc .
i have a poor memory and on occasion i completely fail to notice things that nearly everybody else finds obvious for instance if i 'm looking for something not only is there a good chance that i wo n't remember where i last left it but it 's also possible i could spend five minutes searching for it before i realize it was right in front of me .
strangely i have a very good knack for detail otherwise it 's just that i can be what one would call absentminded '' at times .
at the very least he could pose her under a dickenson marine heater or flashing a composting toilet .
i 'd also not be so quick to say she doesny understand it
did you actually read the content of some of the tweets ?
they are so fucking asinine that someone could wholeheartedly support the ira and still find them cringeworthy .
ca n't you just put the mech quirks on the same page as the customization page ?
it would be exponentially more convenient for people making builds
it might just be your hardware configuration does n't agree with the game .
waiting might be one of the best options as frustrating as it sounds .
this is fucking reddit.. people are going to believe you..
it 's kindof like ethan and the other gay guy tho i can not remember his name right now haha .
ethan was in the evil pack but he was nice too .
i do worry a bunch about this control theo has tho .
my so was not at your gf 's level but it was a colossal waste of time all the same .
it bothered me more seeing it everyday so i deleted insty/snapchat and limited use of fb .
then i started to see her actions change a little since i was n't participating .
she started to see the annoying attributes of her friends to which i always made sure i gave my two cents on like yeah why does jane need to let the world know that right now '' or i agree with you who the fuck does megan get to take that picture at the beach if she is alone sun baking ? ? '' .
it 's not great to judge but for the sake of the exercise it worked .
in my opinion drastically change the everyday routine and a change will come about .
kurt warner is one of the best qbs i 've ever watched play .
it is n't about men treating women in male-dominated careers that way .
it 's about people in a position of power using that power over someone who does n't have any .
there are some studies of sexual assault in the military out there .
men and women experience this every day in all branches .
certainly not all men and women but many do .
even samuel l jackson looks like a bad actor in those movies its not just hayden to be honest
but anyone who knows me would tell you i have no shame .
believe it or not no skin of my back .
this comment has been overwritten by a commercial script to show that u/dtxer is a fat cocksucker u/sillymaniac is a cunt and u/scanianmoose is a moose
i do n't know what i can add to that .
wikipedia 's category lists are a bad method of deciding how many of something there are they 're often incomplete .
i 'm willing to bet there were more police officers than that convicted of assault in 2015 .
it sounds like you have n't seen our site .
someone should make a video compilation of these situations .
then clips of people telling them they should n't .
after that clips of the noobs trying again completely disregarding any suggestion of their peers .
and finally what we 've all been waiting for strategic execution style team-killing .
honestly i really hate this whole x person did y that shows they know their campaign 's at risk '' commentary .
we 've seen it many times in both the democratic and republican races .
they might be effective but frankly they seem a bit childish and sanders seems to lose out the most from those comments as the guy who is running on his focus on the issues .
well when you 're in the arena maybe you have to play the game ...
because when a society rabbit-holes down toward a service industry society and those jobs become automated there 's nothing left but the shit-tier service jobs .
you name it it 's been shipped overseas because 'we did n't need it ' .
you advance any concept far enough and the pendulum swings from something realized practical and manufacture-able to the theoretical and there 's only so much theoretical jobs available .
an ivory tower standing alone is not a solid structure when you take away all other foundations .
change the field from manufacturing to software for a moment .
why are there still people who continue to work to maintain kitsch-y small-script code to run say a keurig ?
i mean if we 're gon na mock the mug why not mock a device designed solely for single servings for a mug ?
because people want it people will pay for it and because once we completely eliminate all those nicknack developments we 'll have lost sight once again and look overseas to someone who we commissioned to write keurig 5.0 and realize they 've built something fantastic with the framework .
think of the entire creation of content on bbs and the fact that as a direct result of a number of awkward and ridiculous boards improvements were made in the manner in which content was aggregated and refined more content created heavier content that required a better internet framework created and refined again until rss was created and then reddit exists .
eradicate that level of nicknack-ism and nobody learns the steps to advance to something on the level of reddit .
so i did plain old 5*5 without the accessories that icf adds and my chest got big .
you actually do quite a bit of bench and the weight goes up quickly.i had a large chest and large quads .
i would say i kinda looked like a t-rex .
i would n't worry about it as a beginner .
just try and learn good form for exercises so that good form becomes muscle memory .
active carbon is just carbon with huge surface area .
when ingested it can bind '' not chemically just through contact area a large amount of ingested toxins so that they are not digested .

i just have a feeling that its going to be a let down .
we 've heard ubisoft say how awesome it is for almost three years now i just dont think its going to live up to the hype .
not in this patch but even if it does n't get buffed the maps and meta may cause it to become a problem .
almost every unit has a build that makes it become bullshit at some point .
from what i know the hospital also messed up initially in monitoring it somehow i remember my parents saying something about a technician looking at the wrong ovary during an ultrasound and it grew a lot very quickly and caused the ovary to basically twist itself/the fallopian tube over and cut off blood flow .
i was always so lucky with birth control cause it generally helped the shittiest parts of my period the main one actually being my irregularity but i never really got side effects like weight gain or mood swings .
and the one i 've always been on yaz/yazmin is notorious for giving awful side effects .
i can usually tell when i 've started mine because my cramps do n't begin until the bleeding does .
and i generally do n't really get cramps like that otherwise .
but otherwise i 've noticed no symptoms that indicate my period if coming or there .
i 'll have issues with nauseous/lack of appetite when my stress levels are high but i 've never noticed them to correlate with my period at all .
i have a friend who always had a turbulent time emotionally in high school to the point where she needed to leave school and had to get her ged instead .
it continued for a long time even necessitating an in patient treatment program for her mental health .
we 're 22/23 now and i could tell she 's been doing better over the last couple years i 've been away at college .
when i saw her last she told me that a doctor had figured out that one of her biggest issues was pmdd-induced psychosis and depression and a treatment combination of like ...
maybe even just a certain birth control i ca n't remember and anti-psychotics in the days leading up to and during her period had a major impact and improvement on her quality of life .
hormones are crazy and they have such a profound effect on our bodies at large .
i really wish now i 'd taken an endocrinology course in my time in college .
i finally got the trophy after hours of hopelessly doing shit at sanctuary only for the happiness to drop for whatever reason .

they removed it because they introduced ranked at the same time and the community was much smaller back then so they most likely feared that the community would be too split and queues too long .
now on the other hand they show no such concerns with all the new modes and shit they keep adding meaning if they cut some pointless modes soloqueue could return .
after all having 2 seperate mmr systems is dumb and makes both of them pointless .
because every superpower loves to talk about how their goal is to be a superpower .

as for ammo the upgraded shevia has 210 rounds .
if blast furnace is used properly meaning the entire spawn is trained in a big ball one bullet kills 24 zombies which is the entire spawn .
on solo that appox round 235 you could complete with a full gun .
where is this need of ammo everyone speaks of and why did you waste all of it ?

if it actually worked before and doesnt now then it clearly was n't something that was intended and they fixed it so you should just play it without the bug .
if you are having trouble doing whatever quest it is you were doing without that bug then it just means that you need to change your team and adapt or myabe its just too early for you for that quest .
a lot of guys will go out for a beer or something with friends when shit gets hard but advice and solutions are a big part of the whole thing .
if for example it 's over a break up you 'll get the sympathy man that sucks .
but it 's typically followed up by something like but hey plenty more fish right man ?
you just need to hit the gym get your confidence back up and then next week we 'll go out to that one club and i 'll wingman for you find you a hottie to take your mind off it . ''
note my dialog is extra stereotypical for effect my friends would handle it differently but in the same basic way sympathy then advice .
it 's about fucking time they 're doing something .
steam is a platform for all ages tons of children play cs go gambling has no place here .
my hours at my second job vary moderately minimum 20/week generally closer to 26 but can go higher .
the way my budget spreadsheet is set is for the minimum until i know i 'm working more .
it 's just safer and that way i plan for the important expenses .
but canadians do n't have right of residency in the uk so they 'd have to apply for a residency visa like everyone else outside the eea before they could take advantage of those rights .
us tele-market is weird though and not just because of different bands .
the lack of gsm systems phones that do n't use sim cards for some big providers means you might not be able to us a triband eu phone anyway .
two instances of the game one for multi player and one for single player .
this time last year how was four months away .
you should probably start at around like 2800 and decrease by about 100 calories every 2 weeks .
they make it easy to create a weight decent plan and track your calories accordingly .
your goal is to burn as many calories as you can .
so if you can manage it stick with the 5x5 but also start walking for a mile or two on your off days .

i never claimed that functor7 assigned a dimension to n. i just pointed out that n dimensionless which is true does not imply n integer which is probably false right now not that anybody cares ! but will soon become true .
but in the end if you have good poison immune champions then lc i think is worth despite recoil .
being able to end the fight in what effectively is 30 less hits is incredible .
plus it is hard to forego that sweet pi for arenas .
additionally most of the top tier poison immune champons have very good l3 ultron black bolt hulk to name some .
so you can save your power for l3 and use it as finisher no health lost then or just use it .
it may very well be worth the 5 health anyways especially if it does 10 more damage .
also lately i am not a fan of using l1/l2 against really hard ai such as in map 5 .
they tend to have uncany ability to block and even one mistake can lead to half of your health lost right away .
but this may not be the case for bb/the vision as their l1 is both quick and relatively safe .
also as a last note i was thinking about having 1 rank of de just for heal .
with coagulate maxed and with poison immune champ it will heal you for 10.25 of health on any nonhealblock node e.g .
it can be 1200-1600 health for rank 4 rank 5 hero .
you will be damaged for 7 on any healblock node but again it may be worth it in the end .
if its possible to check ping within other regions and find the best state to play with that would be rather cool .
say i 'm in alabama and i want to play with someone in ny perhaps it would check my ping and ask if i am still willing to play meanwhile suggesting another person with better ping to play with .
even when it comes to comedic combo videos maybe this is just me but honestly styling on really bad players gets old after a while .
i always enjoy videos that include the creators ' fuck ups too i think those can be just as funny if presented right .

this is the reason i never bought a vita .

this one is even more expensive than the games for the damn thing .
then you ca n't claim to be against government subsidies .
you 're talking about 100 completion yet you mentioned you just done a run through twice .

you should add more pally facts i think they 're pretty fascinating .

sex is not the controlling element in our relationship rather the power exchange and the dominance submission is and that premeates the sex .

so send a genuine message but make sure you send lots because the chances are it will get ignored with the lazy messages anyway .
sod that i 'm about 5/6 out of ten and so far better in real life that online .
at least in real life you get the chance to demonstrate some value and are n't immediately dismissed .
because this for the most part is n't true .
part of the reason for relatively high tariff increases in 2009 was to allow for the companies to pay for infrastructure .
i think that you can get bogged down by meta-gaming especially as someone relatively new to the game .
also what people often do n't consider is that their local meta may be different to others .
my advise would be to build a deck that is both strong and you enjoy playing .
stick to that deck and get familiar with it .
meta-gaming is then a natural evolution of your card choices to improve your match-ups against decks you frequently encounter .

you do n't say irish fuck sheep am i right ? '' .
you say stuff like a brit visits ireland and asks patrick is it true that having sex with a sheep feels the same as having sex with a woman ? '' .
patrick thinks for a while and says you should ask seamus he 's fucked a woman . ''

there is generally a post normally through your e-mail but is also sometimes posted on this subreddit that tells you what is new to mu this week ?
or it might be month i 'm not entirely sure .
but as a general rule stuff is put on 6 months after its physical release unless there is some discernible reason for this not to happen .
edit https www.reddit.com/r/marvelunlimited/comments/40jkdt/new_comics_to_marvel_unlimited_january_10_16 here is the most recent post about releases .
as the major world medical and psychiatric organizations agree being trans is a normal human variation best treated via transitioning and acceptance so the short answer is we want to treat our medical problem in the way that centuries of psychiatric and medical research have shown is the only effective ethically responsible way to treat it .
basically and here 's the hard part to understand the sexual dimorphisms of your body develop all wrong .
do n't imagine yourself developing as a woman imagine yourself as the male you are but with a micro-dick and a pear shaped butt and huge moobs .
if that sounds unpleasant if you 'd rather have a bigger penis and a trimmer build and a flatter chest well lots of trans men feel the same way .
contrastingly me as a trans woman i felt so much better when i got testosterone out of my system and better still when my body developed and i became visibly and tangibly female .
touching my skin and feeling how estrogenic and soft it has become it 's hard to imagine how much the body i now have come to accept and cherish used to harm and imprison me .

the macbook pro is complete with its box and other accessories .
i like it for its upgrade-ability ssd and ram but it 's a bit heavy and the battery is n't as good as the air .
the air on the other hand does n't come with its box but still has applecare until may of this year .
it 's portable but it is n't really upgrade-able .
i have a desktop for any really heavy workloads and gaming so that 's not a problem .
the bobblehead stand wo n't sort bobbleheads in alphabetical order but rather in the order you placed them into the stand 's inventory .
thus you can sort the bobbleheads by skill and special and put the special in the correct order by being specific about which order you put them into the stand 's inventory .
so for the easiest way put special in first in the same order you would normally .
except the charisma bobblehead must go in the stand last .
this is because the shelves with the circle in the middle of the 'arrow ' arrangement counts as the last in the order for that shelf .
so it must go s p e i a l c so charisma will take the middle spot .
after that you can just put the rest of the bobbleheads on without any organisation or organised if you so please .
just remember on the shelves that have a spot in the middle that middle spot counts as the last spot in the order items are placed on that particular shelf .
just want somebody to talk to hoping to make a long term connection .

b/o 21 keys looking for really fun knives send me an offer and let 's see !
i am a female 22 year old looking for professional help for my depression .
i 've never been to one so i 'm nervous on finding one that fits me .
if anyone has a recommendation or how i can seek help for this i would be extremely grateful .
but if i was i think i 'd be pretty pissed off at new champ select .
currently games can take ages to find in the current champ select when watching streams they can sometimes be upwards of 30minutes .
and having to now find one for each role will make them even longer i would assume .
the other thing is i 'm guessing when people get matched in the same team as certain people they decide to give up their role for the other person .
for instance if i was matched with dyrus i 'm not high elo just an example i 'd probably give up my toplane for him however i ca n't possibly know that until i 'm matched with him and so selecting it beforehand is impossible .
i feel like the new champ select is going to be great for lower elo players but really bad for high elo .
sometimes i delete something as photos videos or applications but i have not memory .
i use icleaner but it gives me only 500 mb that disappear after 1-2 hours .
if i go to settings i see that i use only 6-7 gb .
it is a jailbreak problem infact i have not games or many applications ?

but i have encountered the strange issue of my rear camera not focusing at all ...
i am currently running cm12 and i have fully restored to cm 12 again hoping maybe that would fix it ...
i still have some warranty period left on the device but that would mean returning to the stock rom ... . blah .
does anyone have any last try suggestions to get my rear camera focusing ?
i have a g710 keyboard and estone gaming mouse .
everyone says just click the up c stick slot '' and move the mouse upwards but that does not register with mouse selected as device .
when i right click and manually input axis y '' that registers but the stick barely moves from the center therefore being worthless since it 's not a full button push .
finally when i enter the game i have to have my keyboard selected as device for those to work it wo n't recognize mouse and keyboard simultaneously .
i am so stoked to play it 's driving me crazy .
so now i have a bit more time to relax and what better way than with some kinky rp ?
lately i 've been in the mood for something a bit more rough than normal but i 'm open to negotiation and whatnot .
i woud also like to start a fantasy type scenario for those interested .
i have quite the selection of prompts to choose from but i 'm always interested in hearing any of your ideas .
kinks i would like to include are bondage domination collars humiliation spanking anal oral orgasm control and denial and would like to do more with mind control .
i 'm open to ageplay and bodymod depending on what you had in mind .
such a pretty little thing young and cheerful but it did n't take me long to realize that you were homeless .
we would chat occasionally and i would occasionally buy you a coffee or some food which you seemed reluctantly grateful for .
as time went by we established a sort of wary friendship and when the streets got too cold i would occasionally let you crash on my couch fix you a meal and let you use my shower .
i never knew how you ended up on the street and you never told me so i let you have your privacy .
there are times when i worry that you 're going to get hurt or freeze or worse .
and every time i offer you a home with me you decline .
and so a thought creeps into my head one that i probably should n't have .
maybe i ought to make sure you stay safe here whether you like it or not ...
when i pulled up with cps i was horrified by what i found .
such a sweet young girl to be treated like that ?
i had n't been with police department for long but even some of the old-timers got disgusted by the case files .
the arrest was quick and brutal and i can still remember the look you got in your eyes when i knelt down and told you that they would n't be hurting you anymore .
we quickly struck up a rapport at the station while waiting for cps to start their process and soon you were whisked away to a foster home .
you kept running away from home after home always trying to find me claiming that i was the only person you felt safe with .
soon enough i was submitting the paperwork for your adoption and shortly afterwards you were living with me finally safe .
i like to think that i was a good father figure stern but fair even if could n't help but spoil you though you never ended up rotten .
we even moved to a more secluded house after you told me the city kept giving you nightmares .
maybe its because you 're almost fully grown now but you 've become quite rebellious frequently disobeying me or talking back over insignificant things almost as though you 're looking to be told off or punished .
when you think i ca n't see i 've noticed odd marks around your wrists usually the night after my handcuffs have gone missing .
and sometimes when i pass by your door late at night i hear muffled moans and something that sounds suspiciously like daddy ... ''
the highway was desolate and empty but that did n't bother me .
i know most people do n't think of the desert like that but i 've always been a bit unusual in that regard .
besides it was still nice and cool in my camper .
i was actually pleased with my work on it .
what started life as an ambulance was now my vehicle to live out one of my life goals visiting all fifty states .
the trip had started out smoothly and so far there had n't been any issues with the car .
as i drove down the road i frowned at the sight of someone out on the side of the road thumb stuck out .
ordinarily i did n't pick up hitchhikers but the digital thermometer said it was easily 115 degrees outside .
not the kind of weather to be stranded on the side of the road .
pulling over i park as i wait for you to hop in ...
the details of how the world ended can be discussed as well as our roles .
have you been stuck in a shelter for years ignorant of what the wasteland is like ?
or have we been watching each other 's backs for a while now ?
‚Ä¢ an alternate universe where slavery is still sanctioned .
i find you at an auction and take pity on you purchasing you to keep you out of the hands of the more sadistic even though i plan on seducing you into my bed and ropes myself .
kinda similar in concept to the post-apocalyptic one except with monsters instead of mutants .
an rp based on the universe of a video game/tv show/movie/book ?
if you had your own ideas i 'd like to hear them too .
i 've always suffered from derealization and depersonalization even as a kid .
usually it would happen once every few months and last about 6 hours more our less .
sometimes i do n't even know if i 'm stressed tbh people just notice changes in me .
as i 've grown it lasts half a day to a few days .
for the past two days i 've been experiencing derealization it 's not as intense as my usual episodes it 's mild .
i do n't really feel here but since it 's not that intense i can function pretty well technically emotionally i 'm detached .
it 's like i 'm trapped inside myself and my feelings and sense of self are buried .
i 've been very stressed with this semester still have n't finished exams .
anyways my main point is i 'd feel alert/normal/awake every now and then like an hour for every 3-4dr hours .
i slept normally last night like before bed i was fine .
thought i was ok. woke up and now it 's happening again .
is it on and off this quickly because it 's pretty mild ?
victims ' advocacy groups are going after bernie sanders for asserting that campus sexual assault‚Äîlike all other kinds of sexual assault‚Äîis best left to law enforcement .
in his comments earlier this week sanders stated explicitly that rape must always be dealt with as a criminal manner rather than as an education issue .
while that might seem like a stridently anti-rape stance it actually puts him at odds with the vast majority of campus advocacy groups who agree that rape is an epidemic and yet believe campus-run show trials that result in mere expulsion are the best way to deal with rapists .

i 'm trying to remember the name of a boardgame i saw a while back .
i think there 's some sort of fantasy war going on and the players play as merchants trying to make the most money they can by selling the opposing sides weapons .
ive scoured through many posts and on the nostalrius website/twitter and i have not found any plans to either do future servers fresh reset after x time etc .
i do realize that this is based in western europe so i am not holding my breath for a u.s. server .
does anyone know if there will be any fresh start within the year ?

when tgt was announced many people were hyped for darnassus aspirant and thought that the consistency and power of druid would increase with its release .
upon release it was put as a two-of in every single druid deck .
however lately since loe people have been cutting 1 or even both of the darnassus aspirants for tech/flex cards such as living roots ancient of war and sludge belcher .
here are a few pros and cons of darnassus aspirant
strong against aggro decks essentially has taunt and has an upside if not immediately removed
gives druid 4 cards that they can consistently play on turn 2
is terrible in the lategame unlike the more consistent wild growth
against control warrior you wa n't threats like sylvanas not 2-drops that die to fiery war axe
i 've played midrange druid with and without darnassus aspirants and my winrates usually stay consistent so this begs the question should darnassus aspirant really be included in druid decks and if so should it be a one-of or a two-of ?
thanks for reading and hope to see your responses and opinions .
i think it would be awesome if we got doombot from avengers a.i .
he was by far my favourite character in that book .
maybe they cn give him a passive that allows him to fight with dr. doom .
the only catch is that his programming kicks in and he wo n't be able to perform any actions on his turns .
all he 'll be able to do is protect the one true doom and follow up on his attacks like a mindless tank .

i mean i should n't have expected top quality for only 70 but even our 10k printers at work are horrid .
i have n't played i am on ps4 since june or so and was about 8 ?
hours in.. wondering if i should restart the game or should i just reread my journal ?
also what are the largest or most important fixes inbetween the patches that i should be aware of..
i came back last week to install my updates and there was probably 25 gigs of patches i have missed which is why i am wondering if there was some huge dlc or a ton of bug fixes ?
does the game run better now i would love to know what cdpr did with all that space on my hdd
it 's absolutely miserable and has driven me to the point of needing counseling .
i live in a somewhat poor area and make about 50k a year it 's very rural so the 50k puts me literally in the top 5 of people around here i can basically buy\do anything i want .
i 'm a manager overnight at a grocery store .
i 'm on a salary which is where i feel i went wrong .
my schedule is 10:30 pm 7:30 am but i almost never get out before 9 am because i 'm salaried .
my job expectations are to unload grocery trucks oversee a stocking crew and to help them stock stuff .
it 's not all that bad it 's just the hours and commitments .
recently my labor has been cut so badly by the upper management that i have to basically stock entire trucks with 1 or 2 people .
they have to be broken down sorted counted and stocked .
i 'm paying 2 car payments internet electric fuel oil food etc .
to sustain my lifestyle i need a job that pays similar to what i have now .
either that or let my cars be taken and have my credit score ruined .
so i 'm stuck in this dumphole of a town where minimum wage is an upper-class job .
i do n't want to sell my house that 's out of the question .
do i accept my miserable fate and just roll over ?
my back already hurts so bad that i 'm getting referred to a specialist .
edit i 've already tried looking for similar paying jobs near to where i live but i 'd need to go to school .
i ca n't physically or mentally sustain going to school while keeping this job i have right now .
i bought this http www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00ivpu7ao ? psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 card .
i plugged it into a card reader and plugged that into my computer .
instead of the usual window that pops up when you plug in a new drive there was an error message that popped up telling me i needed to format the disk first .
at this point i right-clicked the drive and selected properties .
i think the micro sd card was formatted to raw for some reason .
anyway i let microsoft format to fat using the default allocation size but for some reason it would only allow me to format 1mb .
so after the format i did a google search and found a guy with a similar problem http www.makeuseof.com/answers/8gb-microsd-card-16-mb .
i tried doing the diskpart '' thing in command prompt that was suggested in the replies .
that did n't work i ca n't remember why sorry .
then i tried downloading minitool partition wizard also suggested in those replies .
admittedly i did n't read any readme files or guides or anything as soon as that program installed so i probably screwed up here .
using that program i wiped everything on the sd card it literally gave me the option to replace everything on there with 0s .
now nothing else i 've tried in that program can get microsoft to even recognize the drive in mycomputer .
in that program when i click on properties it basically just says the total space is 1mb .
at this point do i just send the thing back to amazon ?
as that one nice guy who mains pub pybro i 'd love to be able to heal buildings even a little in case engie dies .

i think that there is nothing wrong with gender norms .
the truth is there is always a norm in society .
if you get rid of gender norms new ones will form because even when people often think that they are not conforming '' they are really just conforming to a subculture which becomes the new norm .
i think that in general men 's testosterone levels are higher and thus on average the results of that have been men being the leader '' and the go getter . ''
i think women connect more with their children on average .
i like sweet kind innocent submissive women who put effort into their appearance and make me feel like my hard work is worth something and like they want me to ravage them and dominate them .
i like to feel like a protector and i really like to try hard to treat my woman like a beautiful queen or sex goddess .
people started to question this i noticed a few years back like maybe 2008-2009ish but definitely by 2013-2015 and kind of framed this traditional sexual/social preference as oppressive or due to an insecurity i have to want to be manly '' or to seek approval . ''
or that women think i 'm objectifying '' them .
well it 's been a couple of years and after beating myself up i 'm beginning to realize that it is n't due to insecurity at all it 's just a sexual preference that i feel like plenty of men are afraid to admit to for fears of being labeled as oppressive . ''
anything that you find attractive in a person is objectifying '' i am beginning to see you can objectify the mind objectify the body objectify attitudes but you know those are all a part of a person so i am beginning to see that it is n't a bad thing .
i wish i had just gone with it instead of listening to all the baloney people were telling me on tv and online or around campus because the women i interact with like it too !
i am only half way through the episode and i have wanted to hug gary at least 3 times just for being who he is .
gary 's mastery of interactive comedy is astonishing especially considering that he 's an older man .
he is one of the last of his generation of comedy geniuses and great job to pete another comedy genius for stepping back as much as he did .
did anybody notice that the 2 times in the first hour that gs wanted to say something serious he had to prefix it with this is not a joke ? ''
pretty much only gs and jonathan katz are that deeply funny .
usually when a comic is the guest on a podcast i know it 's going to be a dud e.g .
brian reagan on nerdist ... so boring i could n't get past the 20 '' mark .
when i saw gary shandling 's name on my podcast app i knew it would be gold .
do you guys and ladies have a similar comedy boner ?
hey guys we are in desperate need of a goalie for our saturday soccer team .

look i love my dog more then life itself but sometimes she can be such a shithead .
came home today after working a 12 hour shift immediately poured myself bourbon .
i 'm tired as hell but i have enough to get me through the night .
my dog decided to shit on the rug for me to clean up when i got home no big deal i know the dog walkers took her down the street 4 hours ago so i figured she ate shit and is done for the night .
i pour myself a huge drink after cleaning and downing the first one .
i go take a piss and while i 'm in the bathroom she i swear to god purposely knocked the glass over to get my attention that she has to pee .
she 's just standing there grilling me standing all over my beautiful whiskey not giving a shit in the world .
problem is i 'm a sucka and ca n't get mad at her but now i have to watch how many units i drink before the store opens tomorrow cause i want to get some sleep .
the thing is she has been doing this lately to get my attention no shit .
i ca n't put my beer or drink anywhere near where she can reach it or else she will toss it across the room and just smile at me like she just told the best joke ever .
my wife thinks it 's hilarious and i do too until right now .
you ca n't swipe that much whiskey off the table after a long day and expect belly rubs you cute fuck .
i just want to put my drink on the table in peace .
i guess it does say something about how much i drink though .
maybe the dog whisperer will do a special episode for drunken retards like me .
when i joined the community last hiatus most fan art or discussion about lapis centered around her being a precious blue melancholy angel who needed to be protected .
that 's still very popular though blue pearl seems to have absorbed some of it and we 're getting more bitter jerk lapis .
like artwork where she 's running a sword through holo-pearl and then giving real pearl a death glare using the ocean to flip off peridot or smashing the gifts people give her .
i do n't know if it 's any more accurate to the character but it 's rather amusing .

i was recently introduced to commander and currently only have a somewhat stock ezuri deck .

let me know if you guys have any suggested deck lists or cards !
basically i 'm just not convinced by how people keep saying t will make your voice just like a cis males '' like..
i really wish it could but its hard to believe because the larynx wo n't expand like it would if i took t during puberty and some people still get ma'amed on the phone .
basically i feel it may be a deeper voice but it 'll still have a chance it will be a high pitched male voice .
i saw a study that said out of like 20 ftms 3 still did n't pass on the phone .
and this is not to bash anyone but aydian dowling and buck angel 's voices are too high pitched for what i would want .
i saw another guy from my ethnicity he also has a very high pitched voice .
but im new to the game and am worried about conserving ammo .
how often is ammo spawned should i just stick to my bow or is it safe to use the gun ?
the other day i asked the optometrist in an independent store which was more accurate and she said the ruler might be more accurate as the machine might give a false reading if the pupils are n't focusing correctly through the machine when taking the measurement whereas with a ruler the optometrist can see this and get you to re-focus .
i might not be paraphrasing her explanation precisely but that was the general gist i got from it .
however i just got an email from another optometrist who said that the pd measurement that they had given me last year was not precise '' as it was done with a ruler and a precise measurement would require a pupilometer .
is either option better '' or are they equal ?
hey i just killed mythic archimonde tonight and was wondering how i get an invite to legion aplha
i adopted my dog and her history is unknown so her age is just best guess .
she 's probably around or close to 1.5 years now .
i first noticed the popping sounds when she sits a few months back .
i was hoping it would go away but when it did n't i took her to the vet 2 weeks later .
the vet did a check on her hips and did n't have any concerns .
there were no issues with her range of motion and my dog did n't show any signs of pain during the exam .
the vet mentioned that this is just a surface check and if i wanted a more thorough one my dog would need to be sedated .
if my vet had any concerns though i would have gone that route but she did n't so we did n't pursue it .
the vet just said to keep an eye on her and if it got worse to come back .
it 's not getting any worse exactly and she 's still just as active but everytime i hear the cracking when she sits or lays down or gets up i get worried .
i do plan to have her hips x-rayed for hip dysplasia when she reaches 2 ... but i 'm not even sure if the cracking is due to her hips or knees or something else .
i also worry about her getting arthritis early and an x-ray wo n't catch that .
my dog is a gsd and they 're not exactly known to have great joints .
i have already started giving her supplements as well .
sometimes i wonder if i should stop playing fetch and flirt pole with her but i know walks are n't going to be enough either .
she 's a pretty aggressive player in both as in she likes to go hard and pounce on the ball/toy and i can see that putting a lot of stress on her joints .
i give her plenty of breaks while we play so it 's not just like an hour straight more like 5 minutes of play and then 5 minutes or more of rest repeat .
i also make sure to keep everything on the ground so she does n't do a lot of jumping .
and for the flirt pole i avoid any quick direction changes .
our play sessions are also on grassy areas so she 's not running on a hard surface .
should i be concerned or i just being extra paranoid ?
anyone else experience this in their young dogs as well and everything turned out fine ?

i 've been struggling with really bad adult cystic acne recently on my jaws and cheeks 20f and have gotten on antibiotics and birth control in order to try and balance my hormones and i ca n't help but feel that it 's due to excess androgens in my hormone system from i believe overmasturbation do n't kill/pm me i know there are non-believers but i ca n't think of any other cause because i 've cut a lot of sugar/dairy/easy carbs from my diet for a while now .
my question is which supplements of natural remedies have some of you guys found that would help with decreasing androgen levels for a girl ?
i 'm coming to this reddit in sheer desperation as my doctor simply put me on antibiotics and called it a day .
thought this was worthy of its own title in case someone connects the dots down the road .
it 's just one more of those strange unanswered things .
jodi starts to cry around the 11:45 minute mark and relate that she has felt guilt for teresa 's death because steve was supposed to pick her up from jail the day teresa was killed to go to aoda class .
but for some reason one that she still has not ever found out they would not let her out of jail that day .
did steve go there that day to find that they were not letting her out ?
did she call steve to tell him not to come because she could not get out ?
did the jail call him to tell him she was not getting out ?
is there a reason someone wanted to keep steve at home that day ?
recall some other threads were it was theorized that jodi was perhaps put in jail so she could not be an alibi for steve .
sure would be nice to know why she was not allowed out that day .
when she tells the story that she would have been with steve that day for that time period when ever it was .
was on the east side today and this guy was walking all 3 brothers without taking damage for the entire kill for the entire hour ... is there a guide or something i can watching for me to understand how this is done ?
how 's it going to when is it charged ?
i repeat the gates have been summoned into the pearth dimension .
my sony vaio pro 13 's bios does not detect the newly installed ssd i think it 's an ahci/nvme incompatibility problem on arch it shows up as dev/nvme0n1 not dev/sdx however i can boot via usb the windows installer or arch linux and i can detect read and write to the ssd .
however because the bios ca n't detect the ssd the laptop throws up an error about a missing hard drive and refuses to boot from it .
what if i put my boot partition on an external usb and tell it to boot linux/windows on the ssd ?
after i cleared most of the game including most of the late game and getting my ares 90 my satisfactory build i decided to make an alternate character and start from the beginning again .
as i was playing through the beginning parts i found a few useful things i could do early on to really improve my well-being later on so i 'm going to share a few of those things with you right now for those who are just starting out or those who are like me and are starting a new game with previous experience .
i 'm sure most of you have seen this said a few times saying the manual is a required read . ''
though this is true i do n't expect you to read the whole manual in it 's entirety .
only read parts you may be confused or curious about .
the ones i do recommend reading are the ones involving buffs/debuffs character stats data probe features and online features .
having an understanding of these four can really help your overall game experience and make things a bit less confusing .
and for those that are new the manual can help make sense of what is actually being said in this post so read up .
another thing i 'm sure you guys have seen constantly .
plant as many data probes at as many fn sites as you can whenever you can .
the more fn sites you have access to the easier it is to travel from place to place but more importantly this means more credits and miranium you can generate over time .
and when you 're generating 10k credits per tick at only chapter 3 then you should n't have too many money/miranium problems down the road if you continue to improve them .
note that if you ca n't find an fn site after searching all over the hex area then the site could be either be hidden in a cave somewhere in the area or really high up where it can not be reached .
for the ones that ca n't be reached you 'll just have to ignore them until you gain skell flight after chapter 9 .
the most important field skill to increase early on is hands-down the mechanical skill .
this is because data probes require a certain level of mechanical skill in order to place the probe .
the higher the skill 's level the more data probes you can install throughout mira .
not only that most treasure nodes in primordia and a good chunk of nodes in noctilum are accessed via the mechanical skill .
do n't worry if you reach a point where you 're at mechanical lvl 4 and you ca n't access lvl 5 because you ca n't upgrade it anymore .
once you 're at lvl 4 with a skill a basic mission will pop up on the mission board called off the record '' .
if you complete the riddles the mission gives then you will be rewarded with the lvl 5 field skill that mission gives .
however some of the mission objectives require you to be at a considerable point later on in the game so do n't expect to get lvl 5 immediately .
however there are 4 specific enemy variants you should be on the lookout for in the early game .
suids ' drops are almost all very important in the early game .
their drops help improve armor with ranged attack up melee attack up and potential up at the early upgrade levels as well as craft lvl 5 augments for those same effects .
specifically these drops are muscled suid bulge appetizing suid tail and fleecy fur .
break all of the suids ' parts to get the most out of their drops .
as for the other 3 they drop poisonous needles pristine claws and insect jaws respectively which are all required materials for the lvl 20 archtype weapons that can be crafted at the am terminal .
for those that may not know most archtype weapons are your first real '' weapons that can get you through most parts of the game before having to upgrade to the next archtype level or getting a better weapon overall .
for the drops break adseculas ' stingers scirpos ' claws and germivores ' flowers '' to get the drops easier .
all 3 can be found relatively easily out in noctilum but adseculas and scirpos can be found in primordia as well .
after you complete chapter 3 you will unlock access to squad tasks and squad missions .
you can check what enemies to kill or collectibles to collect by holding r1 and pressing l1 to browse through the squad task targets .
orange indicates common enemies red indicates tyrants and blue indicates collectibles .
if you clear a squad task a squad mission will unlock back at the blade barracks .
required levels and rewards vary based on which tasks were completed but the ones that are within your level range always have good rewards so whenever a task is completed go back to the barracks if you have time and check to see if you can do any of the squad missions .
do them with your npc party if you can and get the rewards .
the rewards include reward tickets which you can use to trade in for some enemy drops you may need to complete certain crafting recipes .
while you 're out exploring mira like dora the explorer you 'll come across some unique locations like fn sites base camps or bcs for short scenic locations and unexplored locations .
these locations give more than just experience upon discovery .
just by discovering bcs and fn sites you gain a good amount of bp to upgrade your arts and skills while scenic locations and unexplored locations count as sightseeing spots which allow you to generate more revenue if the relative fn site is using a research probe .
discovering also gives you division points which can give you more blade levels especially if you 're a pathfinder or prospector .
so if you see something cool or unique out in the distance take some time to explore it .
bp is the resource you use to upgrade your arts and skills .
however unlike credits and miranium bp is limited in terms of acquisition outside of support missions which can only be accessed when you beat the game and squad missions which only give 2 per mission .
the other ways you can gain bp are as follows
early on bp will come easily as you explore but later on they will come slower and slower so do n't spend bp needlessly on arts or skills you do n't like or want to use .
instead save your bp for arts and skills you really like and only upgrade then to just lvl 3 .
any higher than lvl 3 and it will be too expensive .
for spending bp i recommend putting points into skills before arts because skills are cross-class whereas arts are unique only to their associated weapon .
put bp into arts for the weapon you think you will stick with for most of the game you will be able to use another class 's weapons after you maxed out their class 's level to the highest amount so do n't worry about abandoning your favorite weapon when you change classes .
there are a ton of items to get in xenoblade x from monster drops to gear to collectables collected from the blue diamonds floating all around .
aside from any gear you may not want to use keep everything you get because it 's bound to be useful at one point in the game either with crafting or mission objectives .
for gear you may not want there 's the treasure deal option on the loot collection screen .
treasure deal lets you offer an unwanted drop to other squad members .
the participating members get a random undisclosed roll on the gear and whoever is the lucky winner gets the gear .
this also works with you as well if you enabled squad notifications so you can get gear from others as well .
treasure deal from what i hear also gives you division points so treasure deal is not a bad idea if you do n't feel like selling it or keeping it .
everyone will say join prospectors it gives the best division spoils '' but division spoils are just half of the benefits you get from joining a certain division .
most activities give you division points which are used to increase your blade level but certain divisions give more division points for certain activities based on what the division represents .
here 's the different divisions and their slant towards player playstyles
interceptors the aggressive questers favoring those who like to kill stuff on missions
harriers the hunters made solely for those who like killing things
reclaimers the treasure hunters for those who like finding treasure nodes and getting good loot drops
curators the collectors people who like to collect things both common and rare
prospectors the fortune collectors emphesizing on making money miranium and anything that makes people feel rich
outfitters the crafters and merchants people who like to improve store wares and crafting equipment and augments
mediators the helpers emphasizing on helping others both npcs and other blades
on top of division spoils and division points divisions also periodically grant special division buffs during battle .
you gain a buff based on which division you belong to but you can gain the division buffs of other divisions at the same time if you request for division support from other blades .
that 's it for what i can think of .
if you guys have any other tips or pieces of advice for others leave a comment .
this took a while to put together so i hope this helps !
i keep refering to party members as npcs but you can actually play as party members .
just put the person you want to play as on the top of the list and put yourself on a lower part of the list .
say you win the powerball or somehow have hundreds of millions and wanted to collect every car in forza .
let 's assume that it 's top tier modern training and he 'd be hitting his peak now in 2016 .
so let 's assume he 's in his late 20s early 30s for this one .
let 's also assume that his trainers are 100 competent healthy and have a good working relationship with mike .
also let 's assume that he does n't run into drug/personal problems along the way .
second round let 's assume that he has a good working relationship with his trainers but his personality causes issues for him along the way .

i almost bought the kross 88 today but then i noticed it has 0 knobs .
the roland juno is nice but it kind of just feels like a really big midi controller and it only has 1 mod wheel .
so do you use the attack/etc knobs enough that you need it on the keyboard or will a midi controller be fine ?
is there any keyboard you 'd recommend over the kross/juno for less than 1000 ?

hey keepers so i started playing soccer as a 16 year old last year .
i fell in love and played on an elite club team during the summer and fall .
and now a year later i have gone from backup jv to starting varsity keeper for my highschool .
we 've played 4 games this season so far and i have attached highlights below .
i have a home server rocking windows 8 today and it hosts about six vms through hyper-v performing various functions .
has anyone with hyper-v vms here done an in-place win8 to win10 upgrade ?
did your vms come right back online no surprises in win10 ?
i am just having a look at the google search console and the bing webmaster page .
would a regular blog-website running on a custom design blogger template be able to get a sitemap ?
also how important is a sitemap to your ranking on search engines ?
edit in the title i meant to ask how easy is it to generate sitemaps to submit to google and bing ? '' .
also to confirm are yahoo and bing search one and the same ?
when i try to submit to the yahoo index it redirects me to bing .
if i am to cut the cord i have to satisfy the watchers in my household .
one such channel fox news does n't seem to be available in an hd real-time feed without a cable subscription .
unfortunately since this is our household 's most-watched channel it has thus far been a deal-breaker .
am i overlooking a package/combo that would let us stream fox news and other such channels live to a tv in some legitimate manner ?
i had read that channel offers a live stream now for cable subscribers but that would defeat the goal of cutting the cord in favor of streaming if a cable tv sub is still required .
first i love women and hers femininity i have no doubt about that .
but i am extremely attracted to the femininity of transvestites 'sissies ' i do n't know how to name it sorry for example .
while the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa man with male physical and psychological characteristics sexually disgust me .
i never had any physical contact with a person with this attributes but i fantasized a lot in my mind and feel attracted when i see one .
i do n't have anyone to talk about it .
after recent events in my life i think i 've come to terms with the fact that i might be crazy .
with 4.0 all operations are now set to level 65 correct ?
the only way anyone under that level would have to complete it through the group finder thanks to the bolster .
that means that people who want to experience the story in it 's entirety http orig00.deviantart.net/005d/f/2015/012/3/f/swtor_story_progression__planets_and_flashpoints_by_dreamingeisha-d6wwupy.jpg that would mean they 'd have to wait x amount of days in order to experience it in chronological order .
by adding something like solo ops that would diminish this game even further from being an mmo .
my idea is to bring back the level and/or item rating requirements and not to add the jesus droid .
adds a good way to get closer to your team after your class story .
the sad thing about this however is that all of the companions would be quiet .
now with the right quirks/modifications i 'm sure operations could become doable with 1 person and 5 ai .
get rid of certain tank swap mechanics and your team would be 1 tank 3 dps 2 heals .
after i play a game in this week 's tavers brawl or every time i loose a game of this tavern brawl not sure everything is slower like the animations drawing cards time minions take to attack .
it 's not slow like when you have a connection problem everything is happening at the time you command them to but it takes more time to finish the animations and stuff .
i 'm interested in upgrading heart of swarm to digital deluxe however they do n't offer it anymore on the blizzard store .
when i click buy now the store tells me i 'm eligible for upgrade at a discounted price of 40usd however it takes me to the digital deluxe for the complete trilogy .
this option does n't make much sense to me as i already have collector 's edition for wings of liberty and legacy of the void .
i 'm from the uk fitness freak very positive attitude so i do post motivation now and then and i often have a 'do n't care ' attitude where i just snap those crazy moments you would n't normally let people see !
i will not be enticed by flirty/nude snaps so do n't waste your time .
first ever post on here so apologises for coming across as a noob
ok so years ago i was looking up a phone number for my dad .
we found intelius online and did the 7 phone check .
at the time we did not know that the whole thing is a scam .
here http o.aolcdn.com/dims-global/dims3/glob/resize/1823x839/quality/80/http tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/intelliusscamn.jpg is the image that popped up after you were done .
as you can see there 's the bright orange 'yes ' and right below is the 'no thanks ' .
being fifteen at the time i looked and saw the top part where it says 'free for 7 days ' to which i assumed meant that it would be just that a trial .
but no it actually enrolls you in a monthly charge for 20 per month .
by now it 's been a little over 1800 .
i read online that apparently this happens a lot and you can file it as fraud with your bank .
so my first step was to send them a request for a refund .
i 'll wait for a reply and if they refuse i 'll try going to my bank but if there is anything else i can do please let me know .
edit forgot to say the email i used back then was one i do n't regularly check anymore .
secondly the charges on my dad 's card were there but because i do n't read them he did n't check them either .
another thing is that the billing address on the intelius for the card is our old address and the 'cardholder name ' is not even his name .
it 's just washington mutual with our old address but the correct card number .

in hardpoint currently you get absolutely no score for staying in the hardpoint .
you get 100 points for initially securing it but after that you get nothing .
i usually get 3:00-3:30of hardpoint time every game and i 'm not in the top 3 while the people who were on the opposite side of the map just going for kills are .
i think you should get 50 points every 5 seconds just like you get 50 points every 5 seconds for escorting the robot in safeguard .
my average time is 165 in hardpoint and i should be rewarded for ptfo'ing not ignored .
my website only scores 48 on moz local and i can not improve it using the free service .

my question is if i do pay for moz local at 85 annual to fix my listings does that affect where i will rank for the same content on google searches ?

i 'm just a bit nervous about it is all but i 'll be okay
i stumbled upon this subreddit while trying to figure out why i could n't find any news reference to a guy who was put to death in pa in the late '90s .
i lived in a neighboring state at the time but remember the news reports because it was a short amount of time by death penalty standards from conviction to execution .
granted it was the early days of the internet so this might not be digital .
he does n't show up on the wiki of executed people in pa https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people_executed_in_pennsylvania which started my digging around .
i do n't care enough to actually visit libraries and research anything in print but i am curious .

looking also at sakura gakuin seems that amuse management is wise let the things flow naturally without stressing them and not pull them for money wich i think it 's the best way .
this is not excluding audience because you just cant make killing or pr0n game for children ... just like no one is legally allowed to sell vodka to children .
the problem is that you must understand what you are actually doing you are not making bones crushing game for children its a game for at least 16 if not just 18 .
obviously if you will make your game for 3 years old children no adult will buy that game for themselves so you have to choose 18 because of the size of the market and the genre of your game .
maybe not for the pl but it is for the bundesliga ligue 1 liga ecc

a couple weeks ago i took the 5 mindfulness trainings which felt right though i did feel a bit like an outsider so maybe i should head up to blue cliff monastery sometime in ny which would not be too far .
at the same time the teacher i listen to most is gil fronsdal of the insight tradition .
though maybe that makes sense since he was ordained zen before becoming a theravadan monastic .
it would be much harder for me to get across the country to california .
either way doubt is easy without a set path and personal relationship with a teacher .
i honestly thought he said it was called the fraud ''

well there was angus scrimm david margulies and now brian bedford .
though maybe they can finally put that silly goku vs superman debate to rest given that superman was clearly the winner .
it really depends on which versions you 're using .
current goku shits on quite a few versions of superman but there are some versions of superman that are ridiculous see thought robot silver age

when i got false positived last summer and banned for cheating '' the only way i got my account back was making a stink here on reddit and getting radar 's attention .
dbg/soe 's support has always been top tier garbage when it comes to this kind of stuff .
i have a couple friends that got caught and mistakenly banned in the recent wave one got it reversed but the others i do n't know yet so it 's well within my interests to see a positive end to this .

iirc some guy from mmo-c forums did the math and crit has a lower value than mastery after reaching the softcap .
the only thing i am not sure of is if it was only for ef builds so i might be wrong on this one .
upon selecting the level you begin holding a before the level actually starts .
the controller is just an interface used for interaction with the game .
what matters is n't the physical pressing of the button but whether the block of code related to pressing the button is executed .
as the level has n't started when a is pressed the press a '' block of code is n't executed .
therefore the commands related to pressing the button were n't used to beat the level .
if anything calling it 0.5 presses is incorrect because there is no execution of pressing a just code related to pressing other buttons and checking if a is being held .
it 's just people ignoring fact and pissing all over each other uselessly .
like for example i could argue that light yagami is the strongest .
or someone like lelouch could just look at saitama and be like kill yourself ''
i really hate these sort of fights because it 's pointless.Ôªø

didnt feel like turning any of my closer friends into animals so i took the opportunity to sketch a black bear in bathrobe http i.imgur.com/3g2nwqc.jpg
u/redakks gave a link to the qanda but it did n't have bernie 's awesome reaction so here you go !
i 'm not saying they should n't publish it .
i 'm saying i 've understood all of their satire and i 've never once thought it was clever or interesting the least bit .
if anything it was distasteful but mostly it was just fucking boring .
it 's pretty likely he is an eagle scout which is honestly a hugely challenging accomplishment .
however as far as i know i only made it to first class rank scouts are n't supposed to advocate political stances in uniform .
this build is pretty great however i see the lack of any charisma as being a bit of an issue .
with the way i play at least all my builds must start at at least 3 cha so i can be within a few levels of local leader which is almost necessary if you ever wan na build settlements and have shops late game plus building workbenches in different areas and all that and building extra power armor stations is pretty nice .
so id recommend a lower starting perception and maybe less luck in order to get higher cha but thats just me .
i know it sounds silly but have you ever tried wearing leggings under your pants ?
i do that when its super windy and it looks normal !
i do n't wear my tiiiightest skinny jeans but they 're still tight .
hardest would be sakuya imo but anubis also has a good case .
hopefully one day i 'll find and land my dream job as well !
i 've never been in that strike where i have n't been the one to do it .
the photo actually only captures about half the garage .
and it 's more like stuff that he happened upon maybe ordered some posters on his bday over 2 years .
that the fish is 'fine ' afterwards is irrelevant this is fucking cruel .
they might have survived if they had n't gone with that name .
in america that name reminds us of the old bin laden videos .
sexual predators often escalate their behaviors and peeing in public is a way to expose one 's self while still having an excuse albeit a shitty one .
so i think someone peeing around children in public should be charged because they could easily find a bathroom .
however my friends ' developmentally disabled uncle caught this charge when he peed at our little league game .
that is a time when this law goes wrong and special circumstances like having the development of a young child should be considered .
none of this matters though because you 're just using a strawman to be condescending to someone who is having some anxiety about sex offenders being allowed near children .
except for the fact humans have lived that way forever .
and revolutions always result in a similar government so do n't give me that arguement .
that 's a great start but you ca n't say you eliminated student loans if they have to pay 60 percent of it back
i mean he should be higher than mad dog and amber at the very least .
i think all of the comments point to one thing you need something extra with bass whether it 's in-ear or an on-stage amp .
on the amp side it does not need to be some huge stack or combo just something that serves as a monitor .
i saw a band recently in a decent-sized club playing this markbass combo http www.markbass.it/product_detail.php ? id=39 .
he was in the foh mix but not in the monitor mix .
for in-ears check out what other bass players think like this thread http www.talkbass.com/threads/bestest-cheapest-in-ear-monitor-system-for-bass.1100112 .
one other possibility is to get a powered monitor like this carvin http www.carvinaudio.com/products/pm15a-molded-active-main-monitor-speaker or a behringer http www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/behringer-eurolive-b115d-2-way-active-pa-speaker ? rntt=behringer 20eurolive index=3 i have an older version of this .
these are under 40 pounds and easy to carry .

it 's ok to see people blown to pieces but people cry when they hear words .
your goal is to shove the wave with malefic visions and your voidlings so that every minion dies with malefic visions on it .
you can generally shove your opponent under tower with just won malefic visions ravaging its way across the wave accelerated by your autos and the occasional q or w to ensure it does n't expire if the minion aggro is n't working with you .
as long as you make sure you 're getting the creeps this will basically always generate a cs lead for you and you can then come back with catalyst/roa/a fuckton of dorans/whatever and work on killing your opponent with a flash combo once you hit six .
or you could just not save history in the first place .
just dont get a contract if its bugging you so much .
this is the first time in almost 3 years that i have gotten to do something so this feels great ! !
usually i just apologize and let them insult me .
this time was different because they were even more belligerent than usual plus the charge back basically amounts to bullying .
they are hoping that if they threaten us that we will give them free stuff or a credit .
lol i thought the title said guldo '' at first like you were gon na set him up with the world or something xd
it looks like this post has some tables that i might be able to parse .
to keep things tidy and not detract from actual discussion of these tables please make your u/roll_one_for_me requests as children to this comment .
you can find details about me at this https www.reddit.com/r/dndbehindthescreen/comments/3rryc9/introducing_a_new_bot_uroll_one_for_me_for_all post .
if it looks like i 've gone off the rails and might be summoning skynet let u/purelyapplied know even though he sees all of these because of the mentions anyway .
i still watch his fight vs moen whenever i wan na watch someone catch a good ol fashioned pummeling .
the match went longer then i thought it would and that is n't a bad thing .
its crazy how we start even with teams then crush the last half
i 've noticed this too same thing with some health components .
maybe they use some parts '' of the component p
unless it all adds up i 'm not going to check that 's a level of caring that i have for very little .
it 's often described as besieged though example https www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/2079/2015/en .
and that 's the only area that can really count which would be large enough .
there 's a few other smaller areas but they would n't amount to 180k .
i 've been fooled once when i asked for a light lager and a got a yuengling light .
i have n't been there myself but some friends of mine were there last week and they never had much complimentary to say .
they liked the atmosphere but said everything else was sorely lacking attentiveness of wait staff speed of service quality of food and so on .
i 'll put it this way they had to ask that several of their plates go back as they were all very cold almost as if they were ready fifteen minutes before they actually made it to the table .
they are free to do whatever they want with the proceeds from the game .
having lost my father to cancer however the story sounds like it would hit a bit too close to home for my liking .
i might pick it up in the future if it 's really cheap more so if there was a statement about at least some of the proceeds being donated to cancer research .
tl dr small chance i might pick it up as is bigger chance i would pick it up if some money went to cancer research .
why would he randomly be training otters to play dead

if your job has a lot of research involved there should will be biostatisticians that you will collaborate with .
kragg has always been a mediocre character that people complain about for the exact same reasons as they do grapplers in other fighting games .
he absolutely dominates mediocre players because of how high the rewards off reads are but if you actually know how to parry he 's trivial .
i 'm not sure why people thought his side b was a problem for instance you parry it and you get a massive punish window .
you take a dynamic character and rather than nerf stuff like his combo game you just take out what makes him interesting .
it destroys the character and even worse it 's a boring solution .
i would have been happy with nerfs as long as the character had remained intact but as it stands i have very little interest in playing forsburn anymore .
by the way if you just boil grinds with water in a pot let it settle and pour off the liquid its called turkish coffee . ''
something interesting to many europeans is that americans by and large shun instant coffee .
it might do in an emergency but not something you consume unless zombies are clawing at your door .
drip machines are very cheap and found in most households .
esspresso and related drinks while commonly consumed are not usually made at home .
many home coffee machines have a timer function so that you set the water and grounds at night the machine turns itself on and the coffee 's made when you wake up .
i 'll just drop lotr as it has n't been said yet more appealing in the sense of glory than violence my favourite being the ride of the rohirrim and theoden 's speech .

holy crap are you really still using a phone on 2.2 ?
when jon did not appear to fetch the old bear 's breakfast from the kitchen they 'd look in his cell and find longclaw on the bed .
it had been hard to abandon it but jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him .
even jorah mormont had not done that when he fled in disgrace .
doubtless lord mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade .
jon felt bad when he thought of the old man .
he knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son 's disgrace .
that seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust but it could n't be helped .
no matter what he did jon felt as though he were betraying someone .
if it does n't do it for you there 's no harm in moving on to hl2 .
save black mesa for last since it does things rather differently from valve 's games .
i never had this problem it seems like more of a hassle to try to listen to music while i 'm out than just to dedicate a bunch of my time at home to listening to music .
i usually am just at home sitting at my desk with my vali athpro700mk2 listen to dubstep anyways .
it 's not the type of music i would want to listen to public the best isolating headphones can do nothing for the insane amount of bass .
i would assume the solution to your problems is to get a portable music player that has a decent amp/dac in it .
my favourite is probably final fantasy fables chocobo tales .
it 's a really charming game with a delightful art style .
i usually go greaves on him it can be quite game winning on him because he can farm fast enough to get them for the early team fights and the regen/armour/dispel is amazing .
i 'll have to try octarine i do n't normally get it because it just seems so expensive .
tbh i use it because i liked his personality .
when i was a kid i wanted to grow up to be as cool as he was .
raiyen i was similar to you knew the present would be late so let them know .
sent it to new address as requested they messaged to say they had got it and it was under the tree .
then nothing i messaged just to ask them to post the gift did n't ask if they 'd like it or anything like that .
i put quite a bit of thought into that gift they had very little on the likes to go on so i did my best and had only joined reddit a month before so i guess they only joined for the gift and i can only assume that my gift was n't good enough .
to add insult to injury i also never got a gift .
this is the 3rd secret santa i 've taken part in and the 2nd i 've not received anything .

to be known as that guy '' for taking out your junk you need to work at a place where taking out your junk is n't normal !
i mean i have never really paid much attention to it but even as a dutch person i would say not greeting someone properly is rather rude .
even if it 's a stranger you meet for the first time you open yourself up to them get some eye contact firm handshake and you say 'pleasure to meet you ' or something along the lines .
now i do know that we dutchies keep to ourselves a lot .
we are generally not too keen on stranger contact especially physical and for greetings we like to keep it short and simple .
i 'm sure they do n't hate you though .
well i think a lot of dutch people do n't like to be super formal about things .
some do of course and it 's best to always start off polite but if you notice somebody is n't making much effort to be formal with you do n't take it too personally .
it usually shows that they 're feeling comfortable around you rather than that they 're disrespecting you .
for the price of one small room with a shared kitchen you could get three rooms someplace else .
i study in amsterdam but i chose to live somewhere else nearby because of the ridiculous prices .
the only thing juice fasts are good for is kick-starting your self discipline .
if you can drink nothing but juice for 7 days more power to ya .
it 's a game that blends great gameplay with great storytelling in a way not many people have seen before .
that 's why its getting the reactions it is people find it new fresh and enjoyable .
if you think people are having the wrong feelings about games and that their feelings should be in line with your feelings then i guess you just do n't get how opinions work .

i saw footage once of a group of pigs on an electrified floor essentially .
the cows though they bolt '' one at a time .
and people do n't choose to work in a slaughterhouse for the love of the animals .
many people choose shelter work precisely for that reason though so all the more heartbreaking .

is the urban myth true can a coin dropped from the top of a skyscraper actually kill someone ?
the short answer says physicist jon butterworth of university college london is no .
it could n't even burn flesh ‚Äì except in certain circumstances .
all dropped objects experience constant acceleration ‚Äì in other words they go faster and faster their speed constantly increasing at a rate of just under 10 metres per second .
but air resistance also increases the further the object has fallen .
when air resistance matches gravity the object will achieve terminal velocity '' ‚Äì maximum speed after which it no longer accelerates .
at a weight of 7.12g a 2p coin would in theory reach terminal velocity at just over 19km an hour hardly fast enough to kill you .

it was someone i did n't know so i just accepted it graciously and said i 'd just eaten but it looked delicious fed it to my boyfriend later .

aotd 1 most obscure is probably shirobon https shirobon.bandcamp.com even though that 's a person and not a band but i do n't listen to many bands .
he makes electronic music as well as in his earlier works some chiptune stuff .
songs like this https shirobon.bandcamp.com/track/regain-control-2 and this https shirobon.bandcamp.com/track/born-survivor are pretty good .
some people say he sort of takes a daft punk turn but i do n't know since i do n't listen to much daft punk .

homosexuality is virtually a death sentence '' is not a fact .
there is nothing about homosexuality which is a sexual orientation that people often describe feeling from birth as in they have no choice over it that is or is the cause of any life threatening illness .
and the statistics that page shows say how many people died from hiv/aids not how many homosexuals died from it .
also more people died from various forms of respiratory diseases and infections which is often caused by cigarettes .
where is your self-righteous crusade against the depraved and perverted cigarette smokers ?
gays can get married in the us and are just becoming more and more culturally accepted as time moves on .
i think it 's pretty cool actually that miserable shits like you do n't have the choice to do anything but sit and suffer about it .
nobody likes your homophobic shit and your pissy attitude hurts yourself more than anybody else .

why would i be called a gender traitor '' because of my support for bernie ?
it would seem some do n't have enough respect or courtesy toward other women who think for themselves and have chosen sanders over clinton .
you 're making the assumption that anyone who chooses clinton over sanders is doing it because of gender .
dude i swear this shit happens to me as well mostly with girls though .
i can have conversations with my fellow-male co-workers most of the time unless they 're obviously in a bad mood or sick otherwise but literally the girls that i work with give me no look of invitation for me to talk to them .
there 's this one girl who 's worked with me in the last 3 years or so and literally every time i ask how was your week ? ''
she usually replies fine.. '' and ... that 's it ?
lol sometimes i wonder why i even care to try anymore..

i can give you a better diagnosis '' on how to climb if you link me you 're op.gg .
there are probably some instances where you win lane and lose game yes .
maybe you could have roamed more or warded better or had better objective control .
however at gold and silver to climb you really just need to work on mechanical fundamentals that will allow you to crush your opponent like csing spacing predicting damage etc .
people in gold and silver frequently make spacing and positional errors that can easily be punished as long as you have stronger fundamentals .
however to really get the fundamentals down you should only be playing a few champions .
i play annie for top mid and support and lucian for adc .
i have never climbed as consistently as i do know because i have a large amount of control on annie and lucian and they feel natural for me .
over time it becomes easier and easier to see what was a mistake because you see it so often and from this you will be able to use that sense on all other champions you play .
but i stress again that you must start with mechanically simple champions first or else it will be very difficult to identify what the correct play is and very difficult to identify what abilities you should be using .
mastering '' only a few of these champs will make you a stronger player in the long run .
you say that you find playing the same champion over and over again boring but it really is a tried and true method .
it does n't have to be udyr or even jungle by the way .
you do n't have to play champ that carries the game by itself '' to climb .
once you climb and get better at the game as a player you can expand your champion pool and use it as one of your strengths .
and you can feel confident in your skill on a champion because you can compare it to your simple champions and how well you know them .
lastshadow is great for someone like you that needs help climbing .
he helps people figure out what champions they should be playing and reviews games with people telling him what they could do better .
his coaching costs a lot but if you go on his youtube channel and watch his videos they are free and so valuable .
i climbed from silver iv to gold i this season by playing games and listening to his advice .
nobody loses their shit at the top of their lungs quite like damion .
i 'd love to hear what he would do with some killstreak lines .

just do your research and if the review is n't extensive enough for you go test ride the bike yourself .

i do n't think you need the subscription to just use the app .
i do say often that bracers are better than armor or robes .
that 's because light armor gets 20 def res but have 20 atk/mag/mnd compared to bracer and 1 atk mag mnd would be of similar value to 2 def res .
however if the said armor have synergy but bracer does not we would be talking about 120 def res 50 vs 20 atk/mag/mnd 10 so synergy light armor wins out in this case .

you do n't heal much if you think the active mitigation design has been wildly successful .
yes for your more skilled players it has had little change but for others it has made healing a major issue .
remember when blizzard stated with wod they were buffing stamina across the board to stop players from having massive damage spikes against them while they nerfed instant healing ?
guess what that only applied to players who know their class and their rotation '' .
if a tank is n't doing is rotation correctly like a dk using not death strike correctly it is now becoming an extreme issue for the healers to keep them up let alone the rest of the group .
also the healer 's job is n't just to heal the tank it is to heal the group .
making tank harder like you want are only going to scare away even more players from doing it making it even harder to people to find groups .

i think you put waaaaaaaaaay too much stock and feeling into an internet page .
how does it feel knowing you can be emotionally influenced and controlled so easily by a web page and people from all over the world ?
just because you might not have the same ideas about what a bad ass strictly is .
i have no doubt there are racists on both sides but like to narrow the scope back down to the original topic disbanding the school of hawaiian knowledge .
you can get a degree in african american studies you can get a degree in latin american studies you can be sure children in norway did n't spend as much time on american history and vice versa .
hawaii has a rich unique and complex history so it makes sense to preserve and add it to the 'sum total knowledge ' not try to erase it .
nothing on that page or in the admissions says non-hawaiians need not apply nor can i follow your logic that it 's establishing a state religion .
a degree in world religion does n't mean you have to believe in vishnu or yahweh similarly you do n't need to believe in papa and wakea just assume the creation story will be on the test .
you brought up coercion by colonial powers as the only reason they had a constitution as if that matters .
that 's like saying the us ca n't be a democracy because the greeks thought it up first .
the ethnicities of the 13 on the other hand is entirely relevant it shows a unilateral decision by outsiders to overthrow the kingdom .

i do n't know where you 're getting this hag terminology from but it reads like it came from a propaganda pamphlet .
you 're drawing connections to things that are n't there and making claims that are n't true .
yes non-natives can get a degree there yes they can challenge their grade it specifically says contact your academic supervisor or department head yes there is an external body reviewing their work no they are n't establishing a state religion what ? !
no you ca n't extrapolate de jurre racism from the word 'our ' .
i see your point of view and believe you have good intentions but i think you 've swung the pendulum too far in the opposite direction .

i do n't know if it was something intentional from the developers or maybe i am just trying too hard to make something out of it .

the situation you 're describing is exactly why pr is good .
a fringe '' party with radical views should be able to use their seats to support a coalition and use that coalition participation to influence what legislation passes and what does n't .
why should n't they have that right as the representatives of some small percentage of the population ?
if i vote say marxist-leninist in the first pr election i 'd expect based on popular votes in previous elections that we 'd get a couple seats .
our representatives would then likely cooperate with other progressive-ish parties like the ndp to pass progressive legislation but if an issue arises on which they differ from the other progressive parties they can use their seats as leverage to perhaps get legislation they table passed with the support of the rest of the coalition .
maybe that means basic income or something like that that the other progressive parties do n't have in their platform but are n't entirely opposed to .
as a canadian citizen i have the right to have ideas like that present in the legislature if enough people agree with me to elect a representative .
again that 's the entire purpose of democratic society and fptp subverts that .

california cabernet is also an end point for many people who enjoy wine .
california cabernets are some of the top rated wines in the us as well .
there are also many cult '' cabernets that can cost 350 per bottle .
this does n't mean that by any means they are the best wines .
many people that really dive into wine become bored of that style and at some point might find it less interesting .
i started with cabernet and now i love romarantin chenin blanc pineau d'aunis riesling and trousseau ... . at one point i loved ipa especially because of the high alcohol another similarity to californa cabernet and i still drink it from time to time .
but now my tastes have changed and i prefer a berliner weisse or any sour beers i can find .
the average macro beer drinker may not know about ipa .
but beer is incredibly more accessible and so much easier to learn about different types without such a monetary commitment .
the guy drinking coors light does n't care to know about what else is out there .
if you are drinking ipa it says you care about that type of thing and it puts you in a different mindset all together .
i 'd say most wine drinkers have already accepted that .
why would you even consider that as a first bike ?
you should try test riding a 600cc sport bike before you go any further .

i have been reviewing solutions to the rifle tapping bursting issue and why its not currently as viable and i have found the solution and made some post and got trolled etc .
from the new players i was making a new video just now and realized a big threat i was made aware of from my recent post .
the threat is that reducing or removing inaccuracy at all will only be a buff to the new players and a major buff as i did not realize players are now using mouse macros pre-programed to counter recoil all with the push of a button .
these players are programming a button to perfectly counter the single spread patterns for the guns and the only thing keeping them from having 100 sprays is the inaccuracy values and is why the majority of people are crying foul about inaccuracy they know it is a buff to spraying and their play style and its not the true solution to tapping and bursting i have shown the true solution and my post get trolled and downvoted by these same individuals because they do not want a buff to tapping/bursting even if it leaves the current spray mechanics alone they want the spray mechanics to be even easier by reducing inaccuracy values ! !
do n't buy into this and stay on the inaccuracy bandwagon it is not the fix to the tapping/bursting issue and never has been the issue is the speed at which you can tap and burst back to back is to slow and that is fixed by changing the weapon_recoil_cooldown time from .55 seconds to .25 seconds test it out and see for yourself i have multiple post and videos you can find from my profile .
please do not be brainwashed into that misconception even pros and pro streamers are confused and on that bandwagon and i was to untill i found the real solution and i see now why there is such a strong push for removing inaccuracy and rng these players want to be able to program mouse macros to be 100 or the best they can be so all they have to do is hold 1 mouse bottom down and play with the best of us .
please spread the word and help dont let these new players which happen to be a large portion of the community ruin the game you have already seen they were able to get stat trak music kits into the game and revert a good patch entirely even though the r8 needed the nerf the pistols were fine and the rifles were fine though could of used some slight tweaks they had the whole thing reverted .
my solution leaves the spray mechanics alone while buffing tapping bursting yet they gets downvoted and trolled left and right and i realize now its because they want to secretly buff spraying even more the reason valve has not made the inaccuracy values better is because of the mouse macros which we did not have to contend with back in the day and they are now an issue but are legal .
this is a serious issue for the game and a lot of people are on the wrong bandwagon as far as inaccuracy values the values are fine its the recoil cooldown time that is the issue. ! !
yeah it was the exact same thing you just used macros as reasoning for why we ca n't have more accurate rifles .

i 've just finished watching railgun and railgun s along with index i busy with index ii and have n't read the novels or manga yet so please no spoilers !
and i have some question regarding the anime-original arcs .
as many people have said the silent party arc is non-canon and after watching it i can completely understand why people consider it to be so .
however my questions are about the big spider and poltergeist arcs .
as far as i know these are also anime-original arcs yet when i was reading the relevant wiki pages i know spoilers abound there but i was just trying to get a small recap/interesting trivia and some differences between the manga/novel and anime it said that these two arcs are considered canon .
now my question is if these arcs are hard canon '' by which i mean either written by the original author confirmed by the original author to be canon or the existence of references to these arcs in the manga or novels to make it retroactively canon or is it soft canon '' meaning that people merely consider it canon because it fits in the timeline and nothing so far has contradicted its existence ?
or is it just on the wiki because someone felt like those were canon and decided to add it there ?
yes i will be reading the novels/manga once i 'm done with the anime and i will be following the schedule proposed by u/jbhutt09 for the book club .
i am using the index i railgun railgun s index ii endymion watch order .
p.p.p.s if you 're wondering where i got al this information about the series when i do n't spoil myself by reading the wiki nor visit this subreddit regularly i 've been reading the r/manga rewatch threads as i go along .
back story with embedded rant skip to next section for question
i began seeing a girl late september/early october and everything between the two of us appeared to flow smoothly .
there was commonality between us conversation flowed well and from what i gauged we were comfortable with each other .
as the budding relationship progressed we learnt a lot about each other and were at a point where we were wishing each other good morning/good night on a fairly regular basis sprinkled with cute '' pet names for each other .
i would like to point out that the pet names were initiated by her and i simply reciprocated as i believed she was comfortable with it .
in summary we were behaving in a manner that i would imagine a majority of relationships would typically behave .
unfortunately i got the all too familiar vibe that something was off during the first week of january .
i figured that she must have been busy preparing for the new school semester and kept the messaging to a minimum in order for her to focus and did n't think much of it .
within the last 24 hours she sent me a text message explaining to what can be summarized as she was thinking lately and realized that she 's not ready to be in a relationship and that the she would feel bad if she had me wait for her while she sorted things out .
also attached was the generic you 're a really nice person '' phrase that i feel that most people say in order to reduce the amount of guilt that they are experiencing because let 's face it if i was that so-called nice person this uncertainty that she was experiencing should n't be an issue .
i understand that 4 months is too soon to think of being in a relationship and i avoided the word relationship '' as well as the word love '' like the plague .
i believe i mentioned the word relationship once in a new year 's message stating that i am excited to see where this relationship brings us in the new year which coincidentally was days before the frequency of messages declined .
since receiving the message i have n't responded and i am contemplating whether or not i should do so .
this threw me off guard and it angers me .
it confuses me how she or anyone else would go out of her way to create a dating profile agree to more than 1 or 2 dates with me grow intimate with me only to tell me that she 's not ready for a relationship .
furthermore she also went out of her way to have a custom made cartoon-like image in a frame of the pet names we called each other that included a message of her feelings towards me for christmas .
i now have this gift sitting on my shelf and i do n't know what to do with it because it pains me to get rid of it due to the sentimental nature of the gift yet i do n't want to have it near me because of the emotions attached to it .
since i have n't messaged her since receiving her break up text not sure if that 's the proper descriptor i do n't know if it is a good idea to message her and tell her how i feel about this .
i realize that what ever i say wo n't have any effect on her decision and i understand that however relationships are a two person entity until the very end and i feel that i should be able to explain my thoughts with this ordeal .
additionally should i message her asking for a specific cause for the second thoughts .
it does not make any sense for her to suddenly not want to be in a relationship even through the months leading up suggested otherwise there has to be a cause to the effect .
at this point i view this relationship-thing as it is over and i am content with that .
what i am not content with is not knowing that there may have been something that i could have done to prevent this .
if i were to ask this and an response is given i can use this information to my advantage to make myself a better person so that when the right person comes around i can be at my best and make her as happy as possible .
is n't that the goal of life itself to live each day learning and experiencing new events and to make ourselves better ?
these 3-4 month dating spurts have been nothing but a common occurrence for me for the past 3 years and it is beginning to become draining .
every budding relationship that i have been in starts out wonderfully only to lead to a sudden decline in communication which subsequently ends with a final message .
i am beginning to feel like a broken record player that is constantly repeating the same segment of a sound track .
4 months in with a girl and she sends me a message stating that she is not ready for a relationship which i feel is an inadequate response .
should i bother messaging her to share my thoughts with regards to this and to determine what the ultimate cause for the outcome ?

i tried vaping a few years back with an ego twist battery and those weird plastic disposable tanks .
recently i have decided to pick it up again .
i 'm a noob but i know the experience i want and a little bit of the technical stuff
i do n't smoke cigs anymore but i do like pipes and cigars .
basically i want shisha-style flavour with pipe/cigar nic rush .
i want a more airy draw than someone looking to replicate cigarettes .
it is important that i not make the huge clouds that some people like .
i could go either way with the more technical hobbyist stuff making wicks and coils at this point .
i 'm not sure if that 's a rabbit hole i want to go down but i do understand the appeal .
i do n't fully understand why people are concerned with wattage/temp/etc .
i get that it changes the experience but i do n't fully understand how it applies to me .
i went to my local vape shop with some questions about kits and an evic mini in mind .
the guy warned me against the supplied tank due to problems with he more vg heavy juice .
i tried the eleaf istick 60 with the milo 2 tank and it was damn near perfect .
however i get the impression from the internet that eleaf quality control is not the best and the usb port on the bottom bugs me .
however the guy at the store seemed to think this was a better idea than getting the evic mini and a separate tank as the cost was lower .
however i can get an evic mini a battery and uwell crown for example not sure if this is right for me for 125 which is reasonable .
he also suggested a smok xcube mini setup for just under 200 including some juices if i wanted to spend more .
it 's a sweet looking setup but the bluetooth/app combo seems like overkill .
evic mini with separate tank have no idea which one .
i am heavily biased towards the evic mini but as i have never used it this is mostly looks though the side usb port is a big factor .
i was trying out a new zdps build that replaces w4 as i see using 4 pieces just to get a 40 damage reduction as wasteful .
instead i decided to give up a passive from a hellfire and use the endless walk set which replaces w4 with a 50 dr while only using 2 slots .
in order to keep band of might and oculus ring however you have to drop orotz .
what i figured was that with enough stacked cr ignore pain can still be up permanently so the only thing that required acceleration from orotz was ground stomp more stomps more globes .
to fix this i thought that the mote 2-piece buff could be utilized .
since we are constantly spinning at 15 fury/sec that 's a 1 second targeted reduction on ground stomp every other second which theoretically should make it as fast and perhaps faster than the orotz-based version .
however i discovered that whirlwind does n't trigger m2 for some reason even though whirlwind is a resource-spending attack that triggers orotz gogok taeguk f/r etc .
is anyone else wary of signing up for a razer id when https does n't work on razerzone.com ?

so i ended in gold iii last season i was actually gold iv but played two days before season end so i could get the iii board because i liked it more xd
the thing is that as it is suppose to be i got my gold iii board and everytime i went into a game that 's the one i got until today .
i queued up for a ranked game and it showed that my board was gold iv ?
it 's not that i really care but i guess it is a bug or something .
i recently got a new phone and bought a tempered glass screen protector .
i watched a few youtube videos to see the best way to apply them and found out that in a steamy room was ideal .
i tuned on my shower to get the bathroom nice and steamy and left it going for about 5 minutes .
now you should know that my shower has a clogged drain and after a little bit the water will build up .
i returned to my shower to find the water over running and going into the floor .
i quickly got some towels to mop it up and hoped that that was the end ...
i went downstairs to find water dripping from the kitchen ceiling and onto the floor uh oh .
tl dr left my shower on and found water dripping from the kitchen ceiling
stumbled upon this term in one of the posts regarding a beta update here .
the link with the explanation https www.reddit.com/r/steam_controller/comments/3pdk01/a_short_list_of_quick_points_for_nonowners_who/cw5ftdk seems like it 's down or does n't exist anymore so i 'm puzzled .

marine ma'am squad leaders are requesting a rally point .
today we discuss commander miranda keyes http www.halopedia.org/miranda_keyes daughter of jacob keyes and catherine halsey .
she was the commanding officerof the in amber clad and forward unto dawn .
what is your favorite moment in this character 's history ?
do you see this character showing up in future media and what role would they play ?
keyes would have had a larger role and a full introduction in the deleted halo 2 level covenant ship in which keyes and a group of odsts would have been aboard a covenant assault carrier alongside john-117 .
additionally miranda was originally going to betray the unsc in halo 2 by forming a deal with the san'shyuum of the covenant as she believed that the unsc was responsible for her father 's death .
in order to get revenge against john whom she believed directly killed her father aboard truth and reconciliation keyes would have strapped a bomb to the master chief 's armor .
notably keyes was born five days after the human-covenant war began and died during its last major battle .
me and my friend neighbour as well have tried a lot of things .

i am muscovy i get a mission to eliminate novograd .
i have to take pretty much all of their provinces .
it will take about 3 wars assuming 100 war score each time .
i finished the first war take the maximum possible provinces .
this weakened novograd to the point where all of their neighbors began eating them .
by the time i can dow again novograd 's territories are now split among many countries .
these missions seem like they take too long to complete and usually just end in me missing a few of the territories .
what is the best strategy accomplish a mission like this ?
i have the tickets in hand and can provide photos upon request .
i bought them when they first went on sale but we are unable to attend this year .
i can ship them anywhere in the us within 2-3 business days or i can overnight them if you are willing to pay the shipping .

what 's the best response when wife turns down sex ?
for context assume sex is happening about once every two weeks and this is the third or fourth refusal in a row .
the worst response i guess is to make a scene or throw a fit .
but should i just take it completely in stride show no reaction at all and proceed with my life ?
or should i withdraw my attention from her and if so for how long ?
i 'm concerned that the first option merely perpetuates the illusion that there 's nothing wrong with her continuing to withhold sex .
but then if i try to impose some sort of consequence by withdrawing attention wont that just look like a different way of making a scene ?
to be honest neither option seems very strong but i 'm at a loss for any other ideas .
to clarify i 'm not asking about the best long-term response .
i realize the whole website is designed to answer that question .
i 'm asking for the best response in the moment .

they 're replacing a set of speakers that had a volume knob on one of the satellite speakers so once i have the jbl 's hooked up i will not have a way to adjust the volume or bass .
im looking for a decently priced preamp that has a volume knob on it i 've been looking at the 'yaqin ms12b ' model but i 'm wondering if there are any other options out there around that price range .
i did n't really think this through when i bought the jbl 's so i 'm kinda frustrated since all i really wanted to do was plug em in and jam tonight .

man i never felt so good dying so much !
i 've managed to reach his final attack but i died on the second-to-last swirl of lasers and only using 3 healing items steak at rounds 14 and 18 and pie at 21 .
could have used another item in the round 22 but nah i 'm stubborn
i 'm still a bit sad that i lost at the very end but that gives me determination .
much like when i first died on the strongest attack that was a really nice surprise filled with determination !
at that moment i knew i was going to need to try a little harder than that .
or when i got assaulted on the menu i do n't know if any other game had anything like this .
i do n't need time to stay calm i fought the whole battle calm i wo n't lose my sanity now !
on the 5th death i thought about search if anyone beat him with no damage and watch a video of it was pretty useful for me .

most people probably realize that mike 's bitcoin is dead '' claim is false but i have n't seen anyone explicitly point out the problems with it so i 'll give it a shot .
the flow of information to investors and users has dried up .
yes it is bad that r/bitcoin and bitcointalk are engaged in censorship but mike makes this a way bigger deal than it is .
there 's some short term pain while these sources of info lose influence and people find other places to discuss things but suggesting that the moderator of a subreddit and forum can actually kill bitcoin with his moderation policies is extremely overblown .
for the first time investors have no obvious way to get a clear picture of what 's going on .
any half-intelligent investor will be able to find information not on r/bitcoin or bitcointalk .
but it quickly became apparent that the bitcoin core developers were hopelessly at loggerheads .
mike talks about how the core developers are part of the reason bitcoin is dead '' because they wo n't approve a block size increase .
mike tried to get the community to switch away from core and failed so now he seems to think that other attempts to bypass core will fail .
what mike does n't acknowledge is that he and gavin did a pretty bad job at building consensus for their hard fork attempt .
part of this was a miscalculation that they should try an aggressive block schedule in the first hard fork .
jon toomim seems to have a better temperament for building consensus and is also employing a better strategy of starting with a small hard fork to get more people on board .
it seems likely that bitcoin will fork to 2 mb on account of the classic project .
i agree with mike that we should raise the block size quickly so that usability remains good as bitcoin grows but mike implies that bitcoin is broken right now .
if you look at the actual state of the network nothing that bad has happened yet .
if you look at statoshi https statoshi.info/dashboard/db/fee-and-priority-estimates you can see that since january 2015 you can always get a tx confirmed quickly by paying 10 cents .
had wildly unpredictable fees that were high and rising fast
fees and confirmations are only unpredictable if you are trying to pay the absolute minimum that you can get away with .
it 's true that if you try paying 0.8 cents for your tx you wo n't be too sure if it 'll confirm in the next block or in 10 blocks but if you pay 10 cents you can be almost certain it will confirm very soon .
you can also see on statoshi that fees are not rising fast '' yet .
the only thing that matters to users is how high their tx fees have to be for their txns to be confirmed within a given time .
looking at the fullness of blocks does imply rising fees in the future but users are not experiencing much pain right now .
mike 's argument is bitcoin is broken now '' but if you look at fees it is n't broken now .
these miners could harm bitcoin in the short term if they wanted but miners are generally very concerned about pr because they know that users hold power in the long run https bitcoindebates.miraheze.org/wiki/power_ultimately_rests_with_users .
users do n't actually have to listen to what miners ' want .
so if we let chinese miners tell us what the blocksize should be it 's because users are voluntarily delegating their power to them not because the miners are in a position of power .
here 's more on why miners have little power http hackingdistributed.com/2016/01/03/time-for-bitcoin-user-voice .

my wife and i need a game where we can play online together and kick some butt against others .
and i know a lot of people will say it depends on your preference '' .
but i think i can decide after i hear what other peoples favorite games are to play online
when i say ben '' i mean ben solo aka kylo ren
first off i 'll preface this by saying that i 've never contributed to wookiepedia and i 've never played any star wars games/do n't know any secrets other than what 's presented in the films ... but i wanted to put this out there to the reddit universe to see the response .
she is definitely not the daughter of leia or luke .
maz had said the belonging you seek is not behind you it is ahead similarly to other key characters i do n't think we 'll know much about who her parents were .
we can only assume she was a child given up in efforts to hide her from the kidnapping of children similar to finn .
i think to say simply that rey is the daughter of leia or luke is way way too simple .
there 's no way it 's going to be that easy .
if they decide that she actually does have a tie to the first or second trilogy at all i would predict that rey is the granddaughter of obi-wan .
there could have been a ben jr. as he was old ben . ''
i mean how reminiscent was her jedi mind trick with the startrooper to obi wan kenobi 's these are not the droids you 're looking for. ben ostrower made a really convincing argument in his medium post rey is a kenobi https medium.com benostrower/rey-is-a-kenobi-362b5af09849 .p3b9j7ojw
2 kylo ren ben solo has the feels for rey
you already know the truth ... whoever you were waiting for on jakku they 're never coming back .
the person coming back for rey is actually kylo-ren coming back to the light for her .
maybe rey is the ray of light he needs so punny to rescue him from the dark side .
there is a theme established in this film unlike the others where characters are now turning back to the light instead of going to the dark side ie .
leia knows that ben is n't lost forever and the force is telling her so .
kylo-ren could have killed rey repeatedly but he did not even to go so far as to offer to be her teacher .
therefore there is still light in kylo ren as leia had predicted .
likewise rey did not kill kylo ren when she could have because to do so would be letting the darkness get the best of her .
not saying that there is going to be this huge love story that 's going to unfold but i do think that there was something more than cousinly love happening there ... just sayin ' .
it would be really refreshing to have a female lead not need a man live by the jedi law and that could still totally happen even if ben falls for her .
tl dr did i overreact when my bf made a joke .
from 12pm to 330pm i do lesson planning after all children are picked up monday through friday .
my boyfriend who claims to be my biggest support when it comes to my job made are comment today i can only assume because he was moody .
i was also moody and felt highly disrespected by what he said .
he had texted me a picture and i laughed at the picture and sent him a kissy face then texted him still working lol '' .
my response was did n't think that was funny ''
his response was who the fuck pissed in your cheerios ''
he kept saying it was a '' fucking joke ''
from there is escalated to a full blown fight and i do n't get it .
i have a imgur stream of the texts i can post link in comment .

also in the queues that it has n't happened someone on the other team has dodged nearly instantly and i 'm assuming they 're facing the same issues as us .

we are a warring/farming clan looking to gain a few new experienced members .
we are currently a level 7 clan and have 43 members .
we are a laid back clan however we take wars seriously .
we are looking for mature loyal and active members .
we war twice a week tue and fri 8pm est and everyone is expected to use both attacks each war .
we are looking for members who make a real effort to do well in wars and take the time to learn and improve .
download the band app and join our group for communication and base calling
try to participate in all wars and use both attacks
if you are going to be unable to participate in a war please let us know in advance and opt out of the war .
we do n't have a troop donation requirement but we ask that if you ask for troops attempt to donate as well .
do not attack a base that has already been called by another member
if this clan sounds like a good fit for you and you meet all the requirements feel free look us up in the clan search .
in the join request mention you found us on reddit .
i 'm currently involved in a arrangement where i take people 's lunch orders and go out to buy their lunch and deliver it back to the workplace .
is there any way they can legally sue me if something goes wrong ?
would my actions be considered buying the food and reselling for the same price or am i only providing a free service and therefore not be applicable to the same legal obligations as a reseller ?
it would cost them some big money and lots of risk but the overall fan base seems to be sick of the ufc politics and greed .
their name kind of sucks and they are n't as immersive as the ufc but they have some decent talent and should build on it starting with benson henderson and aljamain sterling and not stopping there .
from reebok to dmcas ufc is hell bent on controlling the industry and the fighters with an iron fist and it 's really annoying .
i think we all stick around because we have little choice .
we love the sport and the ufc provides the best talent and more frequent and immersive events .
i 'd make the commitment to watch if it were a viable alternative .
hey guys when you delete a character and then transfer that ign or if you feel like re-making your characters appearance was there a delay before the ign was available again after you deleted it or was it instant ?
you woke me up this morning for the fourth time this week with your smoothie blending for five minutes which alright i 'll just turn over and go back to sleep like i have for four months already but then proceeded to play loud music through your phone speakers ruining my chances of falling asleep again .
as this was the fourth time this week alone that your blaring music has prevented me from either sleeping or napping or studying studying is not included in this count i decided to get up and say something .
i opened my door and asked as gently as was possible in my sleep deprived state whether you could please use headphones in the common area especially while i was sleeping i told you i would not complain if you want to listen in your room with the door closed .
after hearing your angry retort i knew coming home tonight would be fun but did n't realize i had hurt your feelings so much that you would need to watch your show on your laptop in the common area with the volume turned all the way up .
but it 's alright i have now learned that you only communicate in passive aggressive actions so i closed myself in my room and turned the music all the way up .
but frankly i 'm still being more considerate than you are .
something reminded me of this in another post and i got to wondering .
i took the train from milan italy to lausanne switzerland and back a few days later .
on the train back to milan at the italian border several italian officials boarded the train and began checking passports .
they were n't stamping them or anything like that they just asked for the passport examined it for a moment and handed it back .
i thought the schengen area was free of passport control ?

trying to figure out what the difference is between the dgx modular valves https www.divegearexpress.com/dgx-premium-modular-valve-right-typical-side 40 vs. the thermo modular valves https www.divegearexpress.com/tv-modular-valve-pro-din-k-notched-typical-side that are twice as expensive 80 .
digging online a bit seems like the dgx ones come in just under 2.5 '' in height while the thermo valves are slightly taller at 3 '' .
is there any significant advantage to having a shorter or taller valve other than perhaps ease of reaching behind you if you are diving backmount ?

i 've recently been playing the steam version of taf because i never finished the psp edition .
while grinding up band levels during the final chapter i 've notice a very cool exploit and i was wondering if anyone else has noticed this .
i 'll use kain rosa and edge for an example .
if you use mirage dive kain and edge at the very end of the animation if timed correctly you can use saint dive rosa and kain instantly with no cast charge and it also looks like the person just finishing the first band in this example kain does not consume mp for the second band .
i could n't find any other forums for this trick and i thought i would share .
the trick does not appear to require frame perfect inputs and can be done very consistently .
i can perform this every time by having the second band pre selected and pressing my select button 2 seconds apart counting out 1 2 in my head button mashing the select button seems to glitch this trick however and cause the 2 or more team members to lose their turns entirely and have to wait for the atb gauge to fill again .
thanks for reading try it for yourself and let me know if it works for you too or if i 'm just dumb and this was already a known thing and i 'm getting really excited for no reason .
after further testing with other combinations of characters i 've found that the glitch works with any combination of bands .
for example you could use twin rush ursula and ceodore which has a very fast cast time and use the instant band glitch with any other party member to cast makeshift cannon ursula ceodore palom porom and luca .
this band can easily clear the damage limit upper 40k damage around level 48-50 team and the trick brings the cast time from a few minutes to a few seconds .
got all those guys but in-game it says need 32 ... for the life of me i ca n't figure it out .

hey guys i just wanted to get some advice about using flashes .
i got a pretty nice canon '' yongnuo speedlite for the holidays and i 'd love if you have an excellent guide to using flashes manually .
i got a diffuser cap for it as well so i 'm ahead of the game .
i 'm using it with my eos 750d t5i if you need context .
i will be taking pictures of my college 's extracurricular activities many of which involve low indoor lighting and very hard lighting from the sun so guides to create more diffused portraiture or group photos would be greatly appreciated .
i 've told the nest that i do n't want the temperature to fall below 18,5 c during the night so far so good usually the temperature does n't fall below so the heating does n't even start during the night .
but i 've also set the schedule manually to 19 degrees celsius at 8 in the morning .
but the system starts pre-heating '' somewhere around 4:20 am that is way way to early .
i want the system to start heating at about 6:30 not earlier .
previously i had it set up to be around 21 c at 8 in the morning but then it also started to pre-heat this early that 's why i lowered it to 19 but it still starts to heat so early .
does anyone what happened between them and soundcloud because they arent on it anymore
started slowly learning japanese back in late spring of 2015 and was getting somewhere however the past month or so i fell to illness that kind of took me out for about two weeks ... along with the holidays and personal stuff in the mix i 've been out of my anki/human japanese studies long enough that it feels like i forgot a lot of things .
any suggestions on how to get back into the swing of things ?
should i start all over or pick up where i had left off hoping things would come back to me ?
i have tested this during the speed gr 70 's that i have done and the result is repeatable for sure .
in large density areas with many mobs the fetishes regardless if you are shooting darts or not will only melee mobs even if re-casted .
now i am not the only one who saw this as i saw people from my friends list say rip darts '' .
if anyone can reproduce this let me know and lets report it .
p.s this only happens in greater rifts and not anything else as far as testing goes .
edit it looks like it affects the carnevil mask in general and the fetishes default to melee from time to time on their own .
on another note sometimes removing and reequipping or re-summoning temporarily fixes the issue .
edit2 looks like blizzard is now aware of the issue here is the blue post

i finally decided i want to roll take mdma .
i already know about taking supplements and testing to make sure i am actually taking mdma .
my question is more about the spacing out of taking it .
i already know the recommended time to space out mdma use is 3 months but if i took it at these dates how much damage would i be doing to myself ?
also if this schedule seems to much i am interested in trying lsd .
i feel like ml and moonrise would be the better environment for trip pin because of the more chill environments .
how could i prepare to trip at a festival or should i just stick to rolling .

do you just leave it as is or trim the rest of your leg hair a bit ?

richardson not good enough for the international stage yet ?
seems as if we have to score more runs and that puts a lot of pressure on the batsman .
back to back 300 is always good but looking at our bowlers we need to score 330 or more .
most of the wides were n't because of swing .
and we bowled wides even with the old ball .
when we were supposed to build pressure we bowled wides .
the morale is up we 'll just have to play a few more shots .
we can be on the receiving end if we lose too many wickets .
we have to go out there and enjoy it .
but looking at everything we have to score 330-plus to make a game out of it .
at the end of the day no matter how much you score .
the wickets are good you always get value for your shots and that 's what i want to do .
once i 'm in i feel good enough to score big .
overall pleased with my form but disappointing not to win .
yeah it was good tonight i think we did well to restrict them to 308 .
marsh and finch did n't panic and allowed us to play freely at the end .
the bowlers did well in the last game they pulled india back at the back end today too .
i 'm sure wade and faulkner will get a hit and do well when the get the chance .
since this subreddit appears to have a pretty active and helpful community i decided to repost this thread of mine from r/mentalhealth .
i can see people here dealing with similar problems of a 'fantasy world ' quite often so i 'd like to ask for your advice .
like i said in the title i 've discovered that my younger brother let 's call him tom 23 y.o. has an obsession over some fictional character .
so tom 's been battling depression for 2 years now having been on a few different meds already .
he currently lives at my place and i take care of him when his depression gets worse like it happened in october .
i 've presumed that 's just because of gloomy weather of fall .
and so did his doctor increasing the dose of his current medications .
the thing is tom 's mood used to swing so suddenly i started being suspicious if the change of a season really was the cause .
he started to completely withdraw from socializing although he made some progress on it during holidays .
i managed to convince him to at least hang-out with me a few times .
he was good with it even when i invited some of my friends .
however that one time when my best friend and his girlfriend joined us i 've noticed that tom was highly irritated to the point of showing some hostility towards the couple .
well a bit ashamed of my brother 's behaviour at our little party i 've confronted him about it afterwards but he just waved it off .
a few days earlier however he confessed to me that he fell in love with some girl but he did n't provide much details .
so after connecting dots i came to realization that he probably meant my best friends ' gf .
he snarkily said to me that he has no interest in this girl or any particular girl i know '' and that i should stop making things up '' .
to be honest i was n't fully convinced by that so i started slowly cross questioning him about that girl .
he was n't much talkative on this topic mostly repeating that he wo n't ever make out with her 'because she 's taken ' .
he also did n't want to show me her/tell me where i can see her saying that 'that 's not gon na happen ' and quickly brushing me off .
however he eventually provided me with a quite detailed description of her personality and her interests but not much about her appearence .
many weeks later i finished work earlier than usually .
i ordered a pizza on the way home as we have planned to have it for a dinner that day .
tom 's was paying as i was almost out of money so i took the money from his wallet as he was under the shower at the moment .
and now a shocker for me i 've found out that he 's been carrying in his wallet the photo of that girl he was all over during these last few months .
a bit creepy i guess but after further examination it ocurred to me that that person was n't even real looking rather like a video game character ...
i got a bit confused but i just left his wallet where it was and paid for a pizza myself .
a few days later i 've finally decided to ask him about what i 've discovered .
i casually started to question him again about his 'beloved ' and he once again happily but also somewhat embitteredly described her to me .
then i asked him if he means 'that girl looking this and that ' based of the photo i 've seen .
the feeling of shock he expressed quickly turned into anger .
since that time he tries his best to avoid speaking with me .
i decided to not touch this topic for now but i must admit that i 'm worried .
if he 's truly obsessed over a fictional character and all these months was so gloomy because of well because he 's not able to connect with his 'love ' that sounds too sick to me to ignore .
and he probably knows what i think about it as he was once trying to convince me that it was 'a silly joke ' and that i should n't tell this to his doc well i doubt he did that himself .
i told him that i wo n't at least not before discussing this matter with him but when he avoids me at all costs ... how should i approach this situation ?
i 've already talked to tom 's doctor i.e .
to my surprise he just introduced us to another doctor just for therapy matter .
anyway my bro 's been appointed on february 14th .
in the meantime i 'm trying to talk with him as much as i can but seeing him in a strong denial i 'm still not entirely sure how to approach it .

i daydream a whole lot and often imagine future scenarios where i 'm successful heroic awesome etc .
i usually would play out situations in my head where i 'm telling really funny jokes and i get standing ovations or where i beat up a bad guy real good .
so today i was imagining a scenario about how some no-gooder was ruffling my hair and being a nuisance to me .
i got in an altercation with him and told him to stop twirling my hair .
so he pulled out a knife what an overreaction ikr .
then he tried to hurt me with his knife and i dodged like to left and then to the right and then backwards a bit .
i then picked the knife off the ground where he left it last and then started running after him !
i snapped out of the daydream and asked myself ... can i really run with knives ?
that 's only stuff kitchen teachers say because kids are idiot .
teachers tell me to not rock chairs or else i snap my neck bones but i do it anyways .
so i go to my laundry room and grab a knife from the rack .
i whip the knife up in front of my face and spin around and then i start to pick up my legs and just as i 'm about to i trip over a basket and slice my thigh .

my favorite hobby is reading i do n't think that 's a waste of time because i did n't create a scarf in my spare time .

if you are painting your face up or creating doilies precisely what impact on the world around you does that have ?
just enjoy your life you 'll be dead before you know it anyways .
if you feel the need to be doing something you label as highly intellectual or creative that 's fine but it 's not inherently right it 's just subjective .
op is n't doing anything wrong he could just as easily tell her that spending money on makeup and x amount of time applying and fixing it throughout the day is a waste .

and yes the bigger companies with actual revenue are doing better than the rest with the exception of apple which is down about 8 from one year ago .
the problem with your argument is that facebook employs 10,000 apple employs 16,000 google employs 20,000 and netflix employs 2,000 .
those 4 companies among the top-performing companies in the area are a drop in the bucket .

i believe he is stupid enough to believe that he could rape murder dismember and incinerate teresa without anyone accusing him simply because of the huge controversy surrounding his original false conviction and imprisonment .
i think he truly believed he could deny his involvement in her disappearance and that the investigators would n't want to implicate him in any way to avoid backlash from the community or falsely accuse him again .
steven avery is not the victim here teresa is the victim and this man believed that he could get away with her murder because he 's not intelligent and he figured that nobody would try to accuse him again after he was exonerated he probably was n't aware that his dna was in her vehicle nor was he aware that her remains were still identifiable .
he 's a sloppy criminal who was wrongfully accused and convicted of a rape many years ago but he also had a chip on his shoulder from being wrongfully punished for a crime he did n't commit and i think he figured investigators would n't try to convict him of a crime again so as to avoid a shitstorm of controversy from the community that he was being falsely accused once again .
why is it so hard to believe that he murdered her ?
there is no reason why the county would want more negative attention after his initial false conviction and negative attention is all they 've received since convicting steve avery .
it 's not some vast conspiracy against this guy he is just an imbecile who is obviously so delusional that he genuinely thought he 'd get away with murder .

i agree but the problem with it is that no two people share the exact same axioms from which to build a critique .
as such each critique will be built on a set of different premises unique to the critic .
the premises can vary slightly between critics or there can be an entire gulf between them depending on aesthetic predilections .
critique from myriad perspectives is a very helpful thing .
it can illuminate inform even occasionally inspire but it is always important to keep in mind that it is a series of logical steps that stem from evaluative premises that may well be different from your own .

so the absolute fastest way for you to get to level 100 would be to buy wow 20 warlords of draenor 20 comes with a level 90 boost and pre-order legion 50 comes with a level 100 640 ilvl boost .
if you 're willing to wait a little more time you can start the free version level up a toon like 10 levels takes an hour or less iirc log off and wait a while not sure how long no more than a day i think and then when you log in you get an offer to get wow 50 off for 10 .
you can then get warlords of draenor and level and gear your character the old fashioned way from level 90 .
so if you 're willing to take another couple weeks or less depending on how much you play you can bring the cost down to 30 .
if you know you love wow and know you want to get legion you can also use that method and then just pre-order legion anyway which just brings the total cost down to around 80+tax instead of 90 .

from what i 've read in a few resources jurek 's eat and run and powell 's relentless forward progress you want your recovery time to be about half the time of your fast pace if you 're doing intervals or about half the distance if you 're doing a fartlek .
so for example if you ran 5 minutes fast then you 'd want to rest for 2.5 minutes and then do your next rep .
in terms of duration you 'd rather do something between 30-60 minutes long with a suitable warm up .
for example some of the intervals and fartleks that i have done during my marathon training schedule
there are many many more examples of intervals and fartleks you can find online to help you out .

yamaha acoustics are good value in general in my opinion so i will recommend them first and foremost .
the bigger question is how much you are willing to spend .
admittedly i think that cheap instruments do n't inspire people to continue playing .
like she says pretty much everyone on both sides of the issue dislikes abortion .
and we all agree that in an ideal world no one would get one .
and we all even agree that much of the cause of abortion are various societal issues that she raises .
the problem is it seems that her solution is to ban abortions and the other problems will fix themselves .
unfortunately that wo n't happen overnight and she seems to be ignoring all the collateral damage that will happen in the meantime .
the abortion issue is complicated and i am happy to see that her position is a lot more nuanced than most pro-lifers but it still fails to address the reality of the issue for women .
deep down i know i 'm being unreasonable and i would n't want to potentially ruin my boyfriend 's friendship with emma hence my hesitation in bringing it up with him .

just because you do n't scratch his eyes out trying to get away does n't mean it is not rape .
the second he keeps going after you say no or stop it 's rape .
it does n't matter than he 's your boyfriend and not a stranger who has dragged you into the alley .
it does n't matter that you love him or that you willing had sex with him already .
when you say no or stop that 's it .
you do n't owe him you are not obligated to complete whatever sex act just because you started .

a woman accidentally caught in a dark deal turns the tables on her captors and transforms into a merciless warrior evolved beyond human logic .
there 's only one thing that bothers me and that 's the hard cut-scene where kal-el and lois are in the interrogation room after he talks through the double-sided mirror .
then in the next scene the two are outside facing each other .
the fluidity and pacing seems off which makes this continuity cut '' feel like it was rushed .
it looks like something we would see in a wes anderson film .
but that 's just me being really really picky .
otherwise i feel that the film did its job and it will be seen as a better film once we see how the other films interconnect .
i like to read that it 's someone 's favorite film .

but i just wonder how did the doctor know when will her powers manifest just by looking at her ?
why was he not shocked that erika gave birth to his daughter and he did n't even tell him ?
does the test only work if the powers already manifested ?

may i introduce u to a world of peace and serenity
a realm in which there is no place for anger hatred or jealousy
may i introduce to u the path of the monk
it 's a beautifull concept in which the peace and calm of being a monk thrives while every sliver of hatred get 's whiped out by fire or doom .
the main ingredi√´nts for such a calm and contemplating life style are fairly easy to achieve
all creatures besides monks are inferior in life and battle .
hence only monks can enter your deck as they improve greatly by learning all these spells .
even all tokens must be a representative of our glorious peace loving culture
all creatures besides monks are incapable of our higher goal .
therefore they must be wiped out from existence through the use of wraths .
the use of spells that burn all creatures to death is advised .
we believe in the power of reincarnation and therefore are indestructible .
use this wisdom in the form of cheap spells to make sure your monks know how to survive your own wraths .
cleans the bord stay alive and punch hard with a thousand fists .
disclaimer the combination of wraths protection is not guaranteed .
disclaimer although your monks are in the trusted hands of our dalai lama narset great be here name she may occasionally decide to exile some of your monks .
maybe in a next life they will serve u better .
ps your chances of succeeding might improve by manipulation your library through scrying brainstorming or similar .

both stepper motors on the z axis are tied together in the software and hardware and receive the same signal .
they both stop when the x carriage closes the micro switch at the bottom of travel .
raise the x carriage back up and then lower it again but this time find the micro switch and manually depress before the x carriage reaches the bed this should cause both z screws to stop .
if so then your micro switch is not getting activated by the x carriage when it reaches the bottom .
if pressing the switch does not stop the x carriage then the switch or the wiring for that switch is bad and will need to be checked out further .
if one z screw stops and the other keeps moving then that would be something i have not encountered and could not explain knowing what i know of how the printers are wired and the software inside them works .
rd uses whatever bandwidth available to show the desktop of a remote computer using something similar to video streaming .
mouse moves and clicks and the video stream will show your actions in real time on the remote computer .
when you have a high bandwidth it 's normally indistinguishable from actually being logged on locally to a desktop .
however when the bandwidth is low rd can be very slow to update the changes on the screen and to see the actions of your mouse clicks .
now if there were several remote desktop sessions chained together uugggh ... makes me annoyed just thinking about it it would be an incredibly slow way of doing anything and yes the target computer at the end of the chain would have the slowest input lag poorest video stream back to the hackers computer .
coreutils is a gnu project while util-linux more a loose collection of of tools to help with linux kernel components from various sources and under various licenses .
gnu projects always come with a manual in the info format info coreutils will give you the manual op linked locally and a short description for commands in the man format .
but outside of gnu projects that is not very common ... and they only use man-pages .
the whole point of the serious tag should be that incase the question stem is equivocal about the seriousness of op 's intention then the tag makes it clear .

if you look at the big picture paleness is relatively in fashion right now too .
i think it goes along with 90s grunge revival thing that 's been happening .
i 've been around long enough to see lots of trends come and go and extreme paleness seems more popular than it 's been in awhile .
i think trends are actually going to start moving away from it though as the grunge thing kind of dies out so it 'll be interesting to see how people react to that .
personally i go through phases where i like playing up my paleness and then sometimes i feel like doing something different for awhile and go for a sunkissed '' look but it has nothing to do with suddenly thinking paleness is a bad thing i just like to switch things up because i think more than one look can be attractive .

sure he does motivate people with his sad videos and speeches .
it 's been well over at least a year since he said he would lose weight .
believe me i want him to get thinner and healtier i really do .
but when you see him in one video talking about how depression makes him want to give up then the next week he is sipping from a 2l soda bottle like its a 500ml water bottle he literally is working against himself .
and he says hes on a diet and says his buddy '' is helping him get an excersize plan .
but you know what he is the poster boy for why you should't tell the world about your goals https www.reddit.com/r/lifeprotips/comments/32w9rm/lpt_when_you_have_a_goal_dont_tell_people_about_it .
he makes a video gets a tonne of positive feedback that makes him feel good and he feels like hes already done it .
so sure he can make videos that help and inspire people but you know what the people he helps and inspires actually go and do not sit around and say they will do .
i would n't say hes a scum bag i ca n't say for sure if he just says hes going to do it for sympathy views but as a guy with depression myself i do n't buy his oh i am too depressed to even move '' .
so am i i barely even walk around but i also do n't stuff my face with garbage food and do n't drink pop like its water .
he literally does n't even need to excersize all he has to do is not eat the same amount of calories and he will slowly lose weight .
eat less and work out and he will lose weight faster .
do nothing and he will remain as fat or get fatter which he is after years of saying he will try .

personally i think grrm 's decision was more based on his belief he could keep up a two-year gap between books pace he was doing .
i 'm sure he thought well let 's just skip the gap and if i need to go beyond 7 because i have to add a lot of filler now so be it .
grrm was probably as shocked as we were at how slow his writing pace would get .
dissenting opinion cancer awareness is also a worthwhile cause .
i spoke just today at a cancer awareness event with a group called early recognition is critical e.r.i.c .
http www.earlyrecognitioniscritical.org we spoke with hundreds of kids today and will have seen thousands of kids throughout this week .
these kids are mostly middle schoolers in grades 6-8 who can be self conscious about their bodies and may not feel comfortable speaking up if they notice something amiss like a lump or other symptoms .
's mission is to spread awareness about cancer not in the oh hai guys cancer exists '' kind of way but in a pragmatic way that teaches kids what to look for and gives them the confidence to speak up to a parent or loved one if something is wrong .
we teach kids about a healthy lifestyle and about how to pay attention to their bodies and to be an advocate for themselves and their own health .
obviously cancer research is important but so is cancer awareness .

it 's used when people doubt the legitimacy of the electoral system such as when there are allegations of fraud that have gone un-investigated or when a minority group knows it will be outvoted by a majority and abstains to protest the legitimacy of a majority decision that binds both parties .

now i do agree that pekoms is for sure going to be an ally https www.reddit.com/r/onepiece/comments/412wrf/ms_theory_the_next_possible_straw_hat_member_is/cyz558n but dude you got ta stop hating on people that do n't agree .
yeah cause right now it is basically a game with 2 modes crucible or kings fall .
hillary is the most moderate candidates in this race on either side and believed she had the nomination in the bag .
the logical move is go right position yourself better to pick up independents in the general and coast past the primary
always have to make a new team because we 're missing someone and ca n't invite .
perhaps like a flashdrive you have a capacity to store songs that you like and the older you get the less room you have add .
also i find it interesting that they decided to build it out of glass .
makes total sense not like we do n't get 300 days of bright ass sunshine .
so they had to cover it with giant grey hefty bag looking things to reflect all the sunlight .
it would have to be a mega offer as i 'm pretty set on keeping the pick
the issue with having done keto multiple times is you compare them every time is different .
you just lost more water this time for whatever reason nothing to worry too much about
the helmets i 've infused up the most are my iron banner helmets because they 're well-rounded and have perks that benefit both pvp and pve .
facebook apple and google all got away with their monopolist power grabs because they do n't have any 's 's in their names for critics to snarkily replace with ' 's .
his wife was not played as some laudable character she was an asinine harpy .
i have no idea why people think that was some depiction of a shitty man and a great woman it was not .
i would make sure not to drink when i knew i had to drive somewhere usually to pick up my teenager who is n't driving yet herself .
i 've started to notice a bit of resentment when i was asked for a ride or a pickup on a night that i was planning on enjoying '' some wine .
so my daughter has become my main reason to get this under control and finally stop .
i want to be fully present for her but also for myself .
and even as i type this there is a little voice in my head whispering yeah stop for a while but you can drink again when she 's got her license .
intellectually i know i need to stop but in my bones i 'm still plotting the next drink .
i 'm hoping the support here will help me through .
you are not alone in this struggle and sharing your story has helped me articulate what i 'm going through too .
reinstall directx9c and make sure you got the right version for your system and/or no other version of directx interacts with the game or is running in the background .
a good idea but read '' would still be a necessary right ?
do n't drive on the lower deck of 35 .
if you 've used the store code the game should be listed in your steam games library .
you should be able to right-click the game in your library and select the pre-load option i think it was at the top of the menu .
this then walks you through the standard installation choose location shortcuts etc .
for every great play i make i 'll make a couple of boneheaded ones .
at some point i will see myself in a posted video and hang my head in shame .
'' 8 years in the protectorate and we know nothing about him ? ''
but i would have put them in the lille fight anyways .
also it just seems suspicious that tenjirou had activated his shikai but never showed it 's power yet .
tell your mother that instead of being productive you looked through 3onk 's comment history .
mitis is superb as always the others range from good to slightly painful to listen to .
i 've never used creed so i do n't know how close it is .
i see mixed impressions of how close insurrection ii pure is to it .
but most everyone seems to agree it 's a good fragrance in its own right .
and i think it 's great to talk about clones or more inexpensive fragrances for those of us not made of money .
100 of people who have seen/shared/participated in this so far has been overwhelmingly supportive .
she has to walk with a cain and she walks with a cain
also someone should tell her that scientific studies have proven that prayer has no effect whatsoever on bone-spurs and she should seek further medical assistance .
i 've been trying out other masteries and feel like fervor is better on him because of how his q works atm but i can only imagine how good ezreal would be in long term fights with dft .
its so funny to see hardcore mls fans flip their lids when they hear/read this kind of stuff they simply cant admit that mls will always and forever be a retirement league for stars past their prime .
as much as they dont want to admit mls owners will never turn down a player like torres or drogba no matter how much their fans kick and scream .
basically looks to me that he 's just cleaned up my edit since i made it pretty quick .
only reason i say this is because it has the same dimensions as my edit and it would n't make sense for him to do that if he was just going to have it pasted on top of the original background .
your point rings true but your list is a bit apples and oranges '' .
the copts are a religious minority christian egyptians while the bedouins and sudanese are ethnic/cultural minorities muslim arabs africans .
its definitely not the overall goal of being healthy .
i agree with that but it should be one of the puzzle pieces that leads to being healthy .
they should n't brush it under a rug immediately .
i only need one more flampy but i do n't think i 'll clear level 8 .
do n't get me wrong i understand why it 's a paid album .
money is key in business which is what his music is .
i do n't have an issue paging for an album i 've bought every other one of his and pretty much everything else reach records has put out from artists and compilations .
entitling it cc3 just does n't seem right when the basis of church clothes was that they were free mix tapes .
i 'm all for new crae music and for him to build his business to reach more people .
i just think he could 've been wiser with the title choice .
why do you claim that the detection of gravity waves would support gr as opposed to any of the others ?
but gr has other evidence to back it up .
any other competing theory would need to match the already supported predictions of gr .
one can think the captured federal tax code needs reform while at the same time understanding a local economic issue on its own merits .
it probably decreases the chances of everything slightly as you might expect from an expanding pool but that also includes non-godfest pulls .
if you 're asking how the word of god could write the word of god '' i think you may be conflating the big w '' version with the bible which is actually a misconception .
when word '' is used as a title it 's referring to a preexisting concept in greek philosophy which greek-speaking christians saw fulfilled in jesus not the bible .
christ is the logos the principle of order and knowledge begotten of god the father before creation but the bible is the word of god '' a collection of divinely inspired texts by human authors which did n't exist until someone put ink to parchment .
the distinction is often ignored by hardcore biblical literalists looking to use bible verses to prove that the bible ca n't have errors or be open to interpretation and of course it 's confusing if you mostly hear word '' and word '' spoken rather than written since you can only tell the difference if it 's directly explained or you already understand the context .
i got a garrison and a tarantella from engrams back-to-back .
true but other launch vehicles gslv for example https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/geosynchronous_satellite_launch_vehicle use a solid first stage .
bpd npd hpd and apd are all cluster b disorders on a 'grade ' lower than schizoid and psychotic episodes .
i 'm fortunate enough that i pretty much always have three friends to play with .
the point is that if fatshark would implement support for dedicated servers cheaters would n't be able ruin the game for anyone playing on those .

in front of the gazes of millions this is where i return !
to make a long story short last year i domed at a school about 4 hours from my house college c i wanted to transfer to a certain school last year lets call it college a but i did n't get in .
due to me not getting in i went to a community college lets call this college b this past semester fall 2015 .
i applied again for the college a to go there for the spring 2016 semester but i got denied for it today .
classes for college a would have started january 29th so i thought i had time .
due to me getting denied today i had to quickly register for classes at college b for the spring 2016 semester .
i then saw that classes for college b start on tuesday so i have to register for classes and also pay the bill by tuesday .
my dad currently pays for my school so i had to text him and tell him that my college bill was due tuesday and i needed 2500 .
i thought all was good but he texted me this i got this semester ... your gon na have to apply for student loan moving forward starting with fall semester . ''
i 'm currently unemployed and have been applying to jobs here and there for about 4 months .
every time i see or hear of something popping up near me i apply .
i 've had a few interviews but none turned into jobs .
i 'm also currently just over 6k in debt from college c where i dormed last year .
now with this news i have an income of 0 with about 500 in my bank account and after this semester i 'm going to need to pay for a school that is about 3,500 a semester .
im just super stressed out at the moment so much has been piled on so fast my head is spinning .
i 'm really just looking for any advice on how to limit my student loans as much as possible so i do n't graduate with too much debt because i 've heard sooo many horror stories of people who are crippled by debt from their student loans .
tl dr my dad said that he wo n't be paying for me to go to school anymore and i 'll have to take out some student loans need advice on what to do how to plan for it .
the ak 's really clean and the ibp katowice 2014 sticker is on the wood best spot
i had some beers 4 over 2 hours not that many for me .
woke up a little bit latter throwing up cleaner .
no memory of drinking it or wanting to attempt .
really had to look around the house to figure out what it was i was ingested .
i ate some pretty basic and bland food today .
i can still taste the cleaner despite brushing my teeth a few times .
emotionally i am a wreck today because of it .
already struggling with si with intent and to think i could off myself in my sleep disturbs me a great deal .
ok so i 'm going to university and i met this girl last year and i got her number and we texted and hung out a fair amount .
later on in the year i told her i have feelings for her and she said she was n't at that point in her life right now .
anyway fast forward a year later and we still keep in touch and are still friends .
so i 'm gon na ask about a specific situation because i 'm getting mixed signals here .
keep in mind when we have n't talked in a while she 'll text me saying she misses me and that we need to hangout soon .
i see her the next night at a party and she acts as if nothing happened but we had a good time regardless .
the next day she texts me a picture of us and says how she had a good time last night we did n't hook up or anything .
so i 'm just wondering do you think it 's still worth my time to have feelings for this girl ?
some days she 'll text me and seem really into it and other days she just wo n't respond .
this is a mass-response to all open tickets that may have had their reported issues resolved with recent updates .
let me first apologize for the extended wait time for a response to your oculus support ticket .
we had a few issues that affected a number of people and resulted in a significant bump in support contacts in the first few days of launch .
the oculus support team has been working around the clock to respond to these tickets in the order they 've come in .
our engineering teams have been working diligently on solutions to all of the reported problems and i 'd like to provide you with an update .
as we get closer to shipping launch we will update orders with more granular shipping estimates .
we do not display estimated shipping month on the order history page https shop.oculus.com/history as we did not apply that date to your specific order .
the displayed month was an estimate at the time your order completed .
the month displayed at the order success page when you preordered should be accurate but our agents do not have access to what was displayed to you .
they will be unable to assist if this information is requested .
thank you for your patience while we work to assign a more granular estimated shipping date to your specific order .
we 're happy to announce that as of today we 've launched the self-service confirmation email request tool for our customers .
you can now navigate to the order verification page https shop.oculus.com/en-us/order-verification and request a resend of your confirmation email by entering in the email address used on your order .
once you receive your confirmation email you 'll notice that the order number is also included .
if you used the guest flow to preorder your oculus rift you can enter your order number and email on the order history page https shop.oculus.com/history to receive an email that will allow you access to view the status of your order and edit shipping/billing information .
if you used your oculus id or the logged-in flow you can simply use your oculus id credentials on the order history page to view the status of your order and edit the information .
if you used an incorrect email address or made a mistake while entering it please just respond to this email and we 'll see what can be done .
if you preordered an oculus rift you were automatically opted-in for your reservation for oculus touch preordering .
we understand that some people received errors when checking out in the early hours of the preorder launch .
as of today we released an update that allows you visibility into your status for your oculus touch preorder reservation checkbox as well as the awesome offers that our hardware partners are offering to oculus rift preorders .
all you need to do is access your order history https shop.oculus.com/history and scroll down to the bottom of the page to select the options that are of interest to you .
in the early hours of preorder launch our system was unable to calculate taxes properly and therefore was unable to display a total price .
this issue has been resolved and you should be able to see your total price without issue via your order history page https shop.oculus.com/history .
we 're going to set the tickets that are receiving this message to solved but please if you are still having issues or this mass-response did not answer all of the questions that you may have feel free to respond directly to this message and it will automatically open the ticket and assign it back to our agents .
you will also retain your oculus support ticket 's original place in the queue .
thank for hanging in there with us while we worked to resolve the outstanding issues and again we sincerely apologize for the delay in responding to you regarding these specific problems .
at that point they did n't know theresa 's fate .
edit also should n't the aunt be saying i did n't find teresa .
what with all the what do i do now ? ''
apologies in advance this is going to be a long rant i just need to get my emotions out and hopefully get some clarity from you lovely people .
my ex and i had a pretty turbulent relationship from the get go .
we met on an online dating site this past summer and i instantly fell so hard .
i 've never experienced such intense emotions for someone else before .
the good bits did n't last long because shortly i found out some rumours in regards to him seeing other girls which caused us to end it .
we went nc for over two months during which i felt absolutely horrible .
he asked to meet and to apologize for the way things went down .
i was hesitant about this but thought if he was truly sorry and really missed me we should take things slow .
i mean after all if he did n't miss me why would he be back all of the sudden ?
why now when i was just starting to get over him ? ?
we have been texting a lot recently and i 've been warming up to the idea of having him in my life again but tonight saw that he is still cruising around on dating websites .
how can somebody who cares about me and wants to work things out also be keeping his options open and talking to other people ?
i feel that my friends are right and letting him back in is a big mistake..
but the chemistry we had makes me feel like i will never find that with anyone else .
i 'm feeling so lost not sure how to proceed .
should i attempt to be friends with him just to keep him in my life and hope that one day he will realize that i am the only person he wants ?
ex has been texting me and stringing me along .
just found out that he is simultaneously on dating websites .
i personally think masked will be he just got unbanned and clerkie even said congrats to him xd
i 'm assuming 1k is the profit after paying management companies and insurance .
i rent out a home of that value and pull in about 1200 a month .
after 28 years the 45 billion would be made back assuming a 39.6 tax rate .
i have my lm317 voltage regulator which is reciving 6v from a 4 aa battery pack but i need it to output around 3.0v out .
so i put a 5 ohm resistor across the middle pin and the output pin will i need to put a variable resistor with the 5 ohm if so how ?
i can not just put a variable resistor since if it reaches 0 ohms bye bye laser diode .
i just had 2 fizz mains fight over who should pick him
my goal of this post is to maybe catch the eye of someone smarter then me who has a few minutes and either knows the answer or can point me in the right direction .
another option is if someone knows an alternative to this tool .
when launching onenotejournal it immediately crashes and closes with no popup or indication as to why .
for years i have been using a tool called onenotejournal made by a guy matthew k in 2011 .
this was a single click .net application that is still hosted at
what this application did was create a system shortcut of win+j that would open onenote to a page with today 's date in a section titled by the month that is bundled by the year .
the application would auto create any necessary tab page bundle when you hit win+j to get you to a page with today 's date .
first of the year bundle last years create new month create day page open to day page .
first of the month create new month create day page open to day page .
day in month create day page open day page .
this tool worked great until somewhere in windows 10 land .
i believe a coworker had it working before the 1511 november update but i jumped from 8.1 to windows 10 november .
i have used it on office 2010 2013 and 2016 without any issues as well so i know its not an issue with the version of office .
whats odd is the app its self things all things are dandy .
it spits out a log in appdata/local/microsoft/winodws/inetcache/ie stringofletters .log that states
i also ran procmon and reviewed the process starting and crashing .
i admit that at this point i 'm starting to get over my head .
i do see some lines that say denied or bufferoverflow but its does n't crash right after any of those .
in fact there are hundres of success messages before werfault launches .
i have opened the wer report file and at least to me its not being very help full .
event viewer at least has some error output but not helpful to me
description the process was terminated due to an unhandled exception .
if anyone can help or has any ideas i would be eternally grateful .
everyone at my office uses this and win+j is now just muscle memory to all of us .
the closest replacement i have been able to find is onenote gem favorites which will create the page if you click a button but no quick access to that page via a shortcut .
been talk in global and around about the devs wiping the servers in march .
i now have at least 36000000 experience points in the firemaking skill .
seeing as how it 's his signature move it 'd be interesting to see if it is somehow implemented into the storyline or perhaps even the final stage of the raid series .
selling this amazing looking karambit crimson web w 0.155 float !
so lately a lot of my league games have been ending midgame from instability issues .
just now i was in a game that 55 minutes long and then it ended from this issue .
it is making me kind of not wanting to play ranked right now .
when you are an engineer everything happening seem to be logical .
it 's easier to deal with things one step at a time following plans and procedures without much emotions getting in the way .
just over an year ago my 50 yo wife had a stroke and left her left side weak .
a few months later she had to have a hysterectomy because her doctor thought the bleeding from her fibroid was too much for her to deal with .
we then went on 6 rounds of chemo taxol carboplatin 3 weeks at a time .
things were finally looking better ct scan show some minor tissues left so we went on a lighter dosage of maintenance chemo 4 weeks apart .
after 3 rounds her ag 125 is climbing back up .
we just did another ct scan and found the soft tissues growing again .
we have decided to switch off chemo and try letrozole instead ...
during our last visit with the doctor while we were discussing the different treatments possible the doctor brought up the idea that we should keep in mind that at some point quality-of-life is also important not doing any treatment is also an option .
to me everything seems to suggest the inevitable negative outcome .
partly due to the stroke my wife still ca n't process all these information as well .
i have hinted her to get more serious about her todo list .
i do n't really want to be blunt and destroy her hope .
i am feeling a little numb taking everything a day at a time .
or should we just accept the inevitable and deal with it head on ?
got other things going on in life and 2016 is looking a bit gloomy .
so i 've been playing loads of single player recently just to get myself familiar with how the game works before i get into the multiplayer complicated part .
a few days ago i had trouble with the zombies much less other players .
but as i 'm getting better in single player i 've noticed that unturned as good as it is has a bit of a lack in content you can find plenty of guns food and build a decent base in a couple of hours .
i know that multiplayer is probably not like this since other players are a nuisance but if you ever get to the point where you have a good base a large arsenal and more food than you 'll ever need ... what do you do ?
they 'll think that is just a red herring and ignore it .
just curious on thoughts about transferring as an easytech tech to a cpc associate .
looking to get away from all shit rolling down on us .
if fixing and selling computers is n't enough its also back up cashier furniture department carry outs endless amounts of ink and lock boxes kiosk orders plus the rewards more accounts and digital receipts .
now i know cpc still puts up with a lot of crap and does a lot of cashering as well at least here but they never have to leave their department they have no aisles to maintain nothing to restock no pretending we do n't have the laptop because you 're not buying services crap .
so to me it seems like less work for the same pay .
plus i already know tech and graphic design so i just need trained on the specific equipment .
now that you 've read all that hopefully you did anyone ever done this ?
i get it on eugene i 'm not sure if it 's in portland .
it 's really weird watching him definitely enjoying it though !
in this patch http euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-56-notes patch-items the cost of chalice of harmony got reduced to 900 .
i found this rather usefull because it allowed you to go back 100g earlier to get your defensive manaregen item .
now i 've looked through every other patch and never noticed that the pricing got reverted .
these are the patches in which chalice gets mentioned 5.22 ap itemization changes http euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-513-notes patch-athenes-unholy-grail and 5.22 preseason patch http euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-522-notes patch-athenes-unholy-grail
you might notice that in patch 5.13 chalice still costs 900 with the new path fiendish 820 chalice 900 amp tome 435 545 2700 which was the price of athene 's at that point .
in patch 5.22 several things got changed and the change was probably deemed so minor that it was n't even mentioned but suddenly chalice costs 1000 again with the cost increase of the athene 's chalice 1000 fiendish 800 amp tome 435 565 gold
for all the people saying rito does n't revert changes they do but when they do they do n't tell us
yes all that searching and math just for this conclusion i 'll be going then ...

i need some help on getting a new motherboard for my computer .
my computer has been down for almost 3 weeks now and i 've been without work since christmas because of weather .
my wife makes enough to pay the bills and put food on the table but we really do n't have the extra money to get a new motherboard .
i 've setup a gofundme account to accept donations .
i have all of our pictures and i also write computer programs on it as well as playing games on it from time to time .
been training with these title gloves for over a year .
weighed them the other day and these things were god damn 22oz .
last time i 'll be ordering anything from title probably .
so a little background story i 'm a junior in high school and i live in rochester ny where most people are bills fans .
and so a friend of mines father passed away back in october and yesterday he and his mom went through all the boxes from his dad 's house and in there he found out that his grandfather mortimer liebel spent a training camp with the packers in the 60 's during the lombardi years .
there was a letter from lombardi and a stock of the team that he bought in the 90 's .
but anyway my friend told me that his grandfather was beat out of a roster spot by dave robinson .
i just found all of that cool considering we 've been friends for 5 years and it never came up .
spider crawled into a corner while i was pooping and pulled a houdini and disappeared .
my husband works as a server in a family-style restaurant in texas .
when i asked him how his day was at work he told me he was upset because almost 50 was stolen from his server book .
according to him he had turned his back to do something and his book was gone .
he has reported it to his bosses who told him they 'd check the cameras although they did n't specify when .
my concern is that the boss in question does n't like him very much and may not be of much help .
what i do know is that he can be fired for mishandling his money by leaving it unattended .
my question is can they make him pay for that money even if it was stolen ?
are they obligated to check the cameras to find out who it was ?
have you read the sidebar and rules http www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules ?
he does play some games mostly league and a few games off steam such as l4d2 and such
if gaming what kind of performance are you looking for ?
lookin at 1080p and solid 45-60fps at anywhere from medium to high settings .
i am hoping to purchase used parts as i can looking to spend 400-500 tops less is better though .
post a draft of your potential build here specific parts please .
http www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp do n't ask to be spoonfed a build read the rules !
for now i might pick up the 16gb 2x8 hyperx ram off of the tigerdirect deal right now
aside from that it seems like the asrock b85 mobo could fit into my price range nicely as well .
what i am really unsure about right now is what cpu/gpu combo i can put together as in best bang for my buck .
i do n't like the ultra vortex lights but really want the socks because they project leds really well and want you use my flow lights in umoja heads for them !
if not i plan to make a custom housing for my lights to protect them and make them fit !
edit they wo n't i found the dimensions looks like im buying pod shells
ca n't find this tab anywhere online someone has to have it .

how does the company exists and is able to construct the project and bear the branding and such if it was elon musk who came up with the idea and name ?
308 warlock with experience up to oryx with tom .
my server is in version 15w51b my friend is on a laptop and i do n't know exactly the problem but when he joins his game crashes .
but this does n't happen in older versions like 1.8 .
so basically what i 'd like to know is are there digimon that give a specific star color when converted to stars ? ?
that way we would n't have to convert stars to other colors hence wasting half the stars ... it 'd really make getting megas much faster p
i created my youtube channel back in 2011 named steaithiess .
note that i replaced every l '' with a capital i .
ever since youtube allowed people to change their channel names via google back in 2014 ?
i properly renamed my channel stealthless both lowercase l this time .
i put a significant amount of time and effort into my content and have 545 uploads on the channel .
i 'm not pleased with where i currently am right now as i have 15,000 subscribers .
i have the feeling that the username steaithiess '' limits my channel 's exposure because normally people would type in stealthless both ls and not capital i ''
so my question is did my initially selected username screwed me over for the first few years ?
edit if you do n't know what i 'm talking about here 's my socialblade link look at the username http socialblade.com/youtube/user/steaithiess

or had the ship already sailed on that no way to forgive luke no matter what ?

edit i use a vpn usually before going on it for some safety if that is any lol
i 've been thinking lately about leaving the glorious murderous empire in favor of joining the terrorist militia brave rebellion .
i came to this conclusion after witnessing the justified execution mindless slaughter of some filthy peasants honorable townsfolk on a recent mission .
i think i 'd like to fly a pile of scavenged scrap well built x-wing or perhaps fire a glorified slingshot exotic bowcaster at loyal heroes palpatine 's henchmen .

so i just adopted my lil guy today tony is a beautiful blue male rose petal .
i have a 1.3 gallon bowl for him obviously i need to get him a new one when i get the money to do so .
anyway i asked the woman at the store if i needed a heater and she told me i do n't need a heater for him '' which i 'm now learning is very wrong .
so until then i 've been keeping my heating pad turned on next to his bowl and i put his bowl close to the heating duct in my house .
also i bought these plants that are more spiny '' so i took them out and replaced them with a small mug so he has a hiding spot .
i 'm just kind of freaking out here i want him to have the best home possible .
so i got a used stereo that was cheap worth it if it work but not a big loss either if it doesnt it is a sony cdx-gt20w .
my car has an after market radio and so the connetor fits and and i check the wiring to make sure the sure go where they need to .
i turn on the car it turns on but no radio it has letter on the screen that just cycle on the screen like fm aux sand what ever .
i then get the idea to put a cd in .
i do and it plays it just fine on all speakers .
i then try the old stereo and it work fine with radio .
one thing i did notice is that when i but a cd in the automatic antenna it goes up
i decided to walk to a restaurant in denver wearing a steelers sweatshirt tonight .
less than a minute into my walk someone yelled out of their car hey faggot fuck you ! ''
i do n't really know what i expected but this kinda surprised me for some reason .
i 've never really gotten to the point where i can solo rifts past 30 by myself i just ca n't seem to figure out good combo for gear and build to really help me i have firebirds and can do at most 33 mill frits but thats it could really use some pointers or maybe some friends to play with to help learn me some knowledge to help get me better
so when we first upgraded if you 'd run speed test on a laptop wireless you 'd get about 7mbps .
we could steam netflix but if one person was streaming you 'd have to use 4g or no internet at all because nothing would load .
when the laptop is directly plugged into the modem i 'd get about 15mbps .
not nearly what was promised seeing as the up to 150mps '' has a minimum words of comcast rep of 120mbps wired 80mbps wireless .
so we took the modem into comcast to get it swapped out for a new one at they said that might be the issue .
get home plug in the new modem switch out to the new cable going to the wall and switch out the cat cable to our wifi router .
and once again if one person streams or downloads peak download speed on steam was 1.2mbps then the internet for everyone else gets cut essentually .
so today i pick up a new belkin dual band router n450 i believe .
plug it in direct connect still around 100mbps wireless ... .15mbps .
once again 2.8mbps speed peak on steam downloads and when downloading at that speed on steam speedtest gives me a 1.2mbps download speed and that if i can even get the site to load .
so we upgraded so we could have more than one person use netflix at once and gaming be possible however i ca n't play a slight game of battlefield 4 without mass lag due to slow speeds .
so ... seeing as were paying like twice as much now for this internet ... that is only better when directly plugged in defeating the purpose of streaming netflix in a family of 4 when our devices ca n't do it ... and already dropped money on a new router that does n't seem to make a differnece anyway..
sorry if this all seems like a jumbled mess just pretty agitated at all this and not sure what to do anymore .
i 'm very interested in buying a duck viper preferably silver but any color will do and a tmk alps pcb plate to go with it .

i tried multiple times on windows 10 to login to the my trezor web wallet and it did n't work .
this experience gave me a real shock and i am not impressed at all really .
there was a subtle difference and i was sometimes entering my pin correctly and sometimes i was n't ...
after the war sengoku resigned because he thought that the wg 's way of covering up the truth was wrong .
do you think that in the future there will be a coup d'etat in the marines ?
the reason for a coup d'etat is the marines are under direct control of the wg since the wg is so corrupted there will be marines who want to fight for real justice .
also do you think the revolutionary army will be a part of this coup d'etat ?
the revolutionaries are against the wg so if there are a group of marines who are also against the wg wouldnt they team up ?
it is stated that the revolutionary army has already taken some kingdoms already so maybe the marines stationed there have made a deal with the revolutionary army ?
i know i 'm stupid for taking loans out but did n't we all fall into the same trap ?

britain uses this opportunity to say we are reducing our stockpile of nuclear weapons in this venture and we implore our nuclear-weapon-furnished peers to follow our lead and gradually reduce humanity 's capability of destroying itself utterly .

i 've been sitting through a website for almost six months now .
today i had a family drop off their dog before traveling overseas for two weeks .
i have done two in-home visits with this dog before due to the fact he has n't been around cats and i own two of them .
everything went fine in the visits he paid no mind to the cats and they do their little hiss and retreat until they can scope out the situation so they feel comfortable .
well now that he 's here without his family it 's another story .
if he so much as hears the cats he starts barking .
we 're in a studio apartment so there 's not much extra noise and the cats are stuck on their loft we call it kitty paradise but even if he hears them he goes nuts .
it 's 3am and i 've had no sleep does anyone have any advice to help ease this tension he feels ?
so i am in this other power 's system and i took at look at power contacts cus i am bored and found some stuff i am asked to deliver to any system in hudson 's control .

i have been thinking about moving to ireland for quite some time i 'm just curious about pursuing my career choice .
i have done a little bit of searching but just find websites with unload able links .
i heard players can glitch certain objects to travel through your faction .
if i want to go through my factions chunks which item should i use doors or trapdoors or what setup prevents players from glitching through .
i do n't want to have to break walls and replace them just to move through my base .
i remember people used to argue about it a lot before and after elections .
i looked it up in padguide but i 'm not seeing it .
i hit for a 9 combo x81 multiplier using my a. sakuya team he dropped down to a sliver and turned around and hit with his 32k attack for being below 30 .

while yes the division is a rpg a lot of people dislike that it takes so many bullets to take down an enemy of the same level ?
in my opinion marksman rifles and shotguns are fine although assault rifles smgs and pistols need a dps boost .
nobody is going to use an assault rifle when it takes 2-3 clips to kill a normal enemy while shotguns and marksman rifles can do the same in 2-3 shots .
other than that i have no complaints on actual health of the enemies
remember seeing this around here somewhere but do no remember exactly where .

hi everyone i 'm just writing this wondering if maybe anyone else has dealt with this .
i 've been in a relationship with my bf for almost 2 years .
we 've never really had any big arguments and when we do have problems we talk about them and find our solutions .
i enjoy spending time with him and he 's the type of guy i feel proud brining over to family events .
but we are not an overly lovey dovey couple .
he has never written me letters nor expresses feelings towards how he feels about me .
as in he has never told me he loves me .
never said anything along the lines of i 'm so happy when i 'm around you '' .
some may find this corny but i at least wanted to hear this a once .
i guess for me i enjoy words of affirmation .
he is affectionate he 'll cuddle with me and we give 3 kisses before i have to leave corny i know haha .
he never minds picking me up and dropping me off everyday we live 30 min from each other and he is always trying to make me laugh .
but my problem is sometimes i get this feeling i should end our relationship .
i just sort of feel empty when i think of our relationship .
but this feeling does n't last long max 2 days .
and the other days i love him to the moon and back .
it 's not something that has recently started happening it 's been this way since we started dating .
he does n't know this as when i am feeling empty/indifferent i try to be normal .
does everyone get ups and downs in their feelings towards their so ?
i am currently working my way through silverglen and hiberheim and one thing i havent really being paying attention my gear .
what sort of gear should i be wearing around level 11 or 12 ?
i dont really know whats a good level of armour and buff i should have and how much damage my weapons should be putting out .
i know this is a very open question but i just wondered what everyone else is doing around that level .
it would be good to/know if i have missed any good items .
a lot of people have been referring to bernie sanders supporters as 'berniebros ' and i think we need to come up with a new term that is more inclusive and reflective of our demographic .
my specific problem with it is the 'bros ' part .
first it is kind of insulting as it gives to the illusion that we are just dumb college kids rather than intelligent informed voters .
secondly it implies that most bernie supporters are men a terrible implication as it may encourage female voters to support hillary despite bernie 's amazing track record in supporting pay equity and female reproductive rights .
after all bernie has a 20 lead among women ages 18-34 over hillary http www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/01/14/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-women-millennials/78810110 .
so not only may it disparage undecided female voters but it also misrepresents the demographics of bernie supporters .
i know this all seems trivial as it is just a name that a few people are referring to us as but if it snowballs it could become a significant obstacle in convincing people of the legitimacy of the sanders campaign and in getting the female vote .
we may not use the term but a lot of outsiders use it as there really does n't seem to be another expression .
as far as replacing the term there are many options .
whatever we may choose we 'll have to use it often to reinforce it to the general public so they use it instead of 'berniebros ' .

update 01/15/2015 so once again we come back to this .
sadly the community has been kinda slow lately with the release of catalyst coming later this year but i figure that seeing as i found at least a couple more maps it 'd be worthwhile to put them up and let people go at it .
also a bonus is i 'm including some links below for people to learn how to make your own maps d
here i 'm posting links to several maps made by the community a few years back .
some come directly from the sources others i 've had to reupload because their original site no longer exists .
these custom maps have been amazing to play through and others should enjoy them too .
i 'll be updating the post as i find more and more of them .
if i have time i also may upload them all as zips rather than a mixture of rars and zips .
anyway here 's the current list of probably the best ones i 've found so far
white city https db.tt/0sx6cmii fyi this map is huge .
enjoy the movement 2.0 https mega.nz ! xzy1wbgd ! rdufchmrt72jte6xnof4e3ws2fc_aijzigpwphl2cae updated this one
speedx https dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64316150/speedx.exe this map is a bit odd .
it 's not really a story map but neat .
troubles in the skyscraper https mega.nz ! jnzertyy ! ipi6tlewc17stnevkrcfc7uy4fvv0udnyqc4gylygea moddb http www.moddb.com/games/mirrors-edge/addons/troubles-in-the-skyscraper revisiting the shard .
this one is pretty large but well thought out .
red edge http mirrors-edge2.ru/files/maps/red_edge.rar there 's a lot of red .
pure time trials for steam http www.moddb.com/games/mirrors-edge/addons/pure-time-trail-map-pack-steam-players1 some clever person got this working .
your left is now your right and your right is your left .
props to nulaft over on med.db for this one .
mod menu screen http www.moddb.com/mods/mirrors-edge-mod-menu/downloads/mirrors-edge-mod-menu-101 new this mod was made by u/abincyp and is designed to be able to load your custom maps alongside the normal story ones .
unreal edge wiki http unrealedge.wikia.com/wiki/setting_up_the_editor while this is a pretty good starter source it has n't been updated in a while .
unreal edge wiki starter http unrealedge.wikia.com/wiki/setting_up_the_editor i 'm linking this so people do n't skip over it as the information here is crucial to making maps .
required editor files https mega.nz ! nzjrqdsq ! ldissaevgrb1ry8dc5adtjzgxmlx_fzhk5crgxd-uuw you 'll understand what to do with these after reading the above tutorials .
sadly a lot of the tools and information for mapping were lost with the shutdown of the on-mirrors-edge.com forum .
to install the maps go to your c users/yourusername/documents/ea games/mirror 's edge
replace yourusername '' with whatever your username on your computer is .
if you have a manual install then usually you just have to delete the file you put in this folder .
the game is designed so anything put in here will take precedence over the original file .
as soon as you delete the custom map from this folder though it will act like normal .
from there drop the tdgame folder in each rar or zip into the mirror 's edge folder .
the time trial maps will replace the first time trial map so back that up .
remember that these maps probably do n't have the necessary triggers at the end to send you to the next chapter or level .
that means you need to backup the prologue or original tt if you want to play story mode normally again .
paste the audio_dlc folder and the dlcmaterials/dlcprops files into steam\steamapps\common\mirrorsedge\tdgame\cookedpc '' .
keep the contents of the maps\sp00 '' folder elsewhere if you paste them in with the game data you 'll get errors on startup .
make a back-up copy of the file tt_tutoriala01_p.me1 '' from steam\steamapps\common\mirrorsedge\tdgame\cookedpcmaps\sp00 '' .
to play a given map paste its version of tt_tutoriala01_p.me1 into the directory above start the game and play the playground one '' time trial level .
do n't play online or you 'll screw up your leaderboards .
i 've not included separate links for the mods because the moddb pages often offer insight into them and instructions on how to use them .
it 's a lot of time for me to write individual instructions when they 're all right there .
also to u/mustangwolf1997 the mod here for merc seems to be fixed where the crashing is concerned .
give it a try and figure out what your problem was before .
some of the files i have linked are .exe files i should note that these are just convenient auto installers for the maps .
some maps come with a lot of custom content ie .
it makes it easier than trying to find the right folder for a couple dozen files .
just make sure it 's set to the mirror 's edge directory shown above .
some of the .rar files might have installers in them too .
none of these are harmful and i can guarantee every map i 've posted has been run on my computer .
if there 's a complaint let me know and i 'll have the map removed .
on a final note if you have any requests let me know and i 'll add it to the list .
and if you find a broken link i 'll make sure the map gets reuploaded for you all .

hi i am a 21 year old female and i just had some questions about thyroid nodules .
i have had a nodule for about four years .
when i first discovered it i got a fine needle aspiration done but the doctor only did one pass with the needle .
he also did it right in the middle of the thyroid when most of the nodule is located on the side .
i know he 's the doctor and obviously knows what he 's doing but it seemed like he was in a rush and just wanted to get it done quick .
the results came back that it was normal and noncancerous .
that was four years ago and since then the nodule stayed pretty much the same size until about four months ago it just started growing rapidly and now it 's located solely on one side .
my lymph nodes have been swollen for about the same amount of time that i 've had the nodule .
also all of my thyroid tests have come back normal over the years .
basically what i am wondering is if it 's worth it to get another fna ?
is it possible that the first one could have missed something ?

it absolutely is tolerated and in fact encouraged in large portions of north africa and the middle east .
the quran contains the instructions for a whole political system and because muhammad claims to be the final and last prophet and all others afterwards are liars there 's no chance of reform like what judaism and christianity underwent .

he 's also one of the most exciting scorers and ball handlers in the league and as a result one of the most popular players in the league but obviously you would n't mention that

i 'm not surprised you 've never heard of them .

so not sure what this has to do with it but sure let 's say that the ancient hebrews meant the physical universe when they said god .
so do you mean the universe or just the physical parts ?
surely our subjective experiences are part of the universe but not all that physical ?
i have a rather big problem with the word universe altogether .
i really prefer to avoid it when the going gets rough .
i am under the impression that ancient hebrews and chinese and greeks and indians all felt that the physical world around us is just one layer of reality and it exists because of a deeper reality .
in trying to solve the measurement problem in quantum mechanics even modern physicists post some multiverse .
i agree but even the linked chart might be interpreted in a misleading fashion .
what we are really interested in is the percent cost change over time .
because inflation compounds this change the slope of the curve will appear steeper and steeper even if the rate is constant .
this data http trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/tuition-and-fees-and-room-and-board-over-time-1975-76-2015-16-selected-years shows that the real rate adjusted for inflation has been high as far back as 1980 .
keep in mind that capitol hill has several different parts and is actually a pretty large neighborhood .
there 's the more well known parts which are down near where pike and pine run into broadway .
that 's where all the bars restaurants and quirky shops are .
there 's a mostly residential area around volunteer park that has had very expensive homes condos and apartments for a very long time about a century which is practically forever on the west coast .

i 've read the pentagon 's report on climate change .
populations will be forced to move inland droughts conflict and new viruses are some of the things they predicted .
they also forecast it will take several decades for the effects of climate change to be felt .
more over politicians and corporations know it 's coming .
climate change will not be like the day after tomorrow were suddenly everything is destroyed .
climate change will put pressure on nations and economies but there will be no sudden collapse .

the last 5 years by tony award winning composer and lyricist jason robert brown is a musical deconstruction of a love affair and a marriage taking place over a five year period .
jamie wellerstein is a young talented up and coming jewish novelist who falls in love with cathy hiatt a shiksa goddess struggling actress .
their story is told almost entirely through songs using an intercutting time line device all of cathy 's songs begin at the end of their marriage and move backwards in time to the beginning of their love affair while jamie 's songs start at the beginning of their affair and move forward to the end of their marriage .
the last five years received mixed reviews from critics .
anna kendrick 's performance was met with widespread critical acclaim with many citing it as the best performance of her career .
the review aggregator website rotten tomatoes reported a 60 approval rating based on 84 reviews with an average rating of 6\.2\/10 .
the site 's critical consensus states the last five years hits a few awkward notes in its transition from stage to screen but its freshness and sincere charm and well-matched stars offer their own rewards . ''
metacritic which assigns a weighted average score calculated an average score of 60 out of 100 based on 28 critics indicating mixed or average reviews '' .

a storm raged outside that battered the manor with howling winds unrepentant rain and explosive thunder .
all the while he could n't help but hear the cold booms from murderous guns and the pleas for mercy from the helpless victims .
a fire burned in his hearth as he sipped his scotch and he dared not look at the windows for fear of seeing the slain 's tears sliding down the transparent hereafter .
very well sir i will take my leave of you and see you in the morning . ''
this ... '' he looked around the dark room that danced red from the firelight of his hearth and was contorted with shadows from the lightning ... this has to end . ''
alfred gave way to silence as he let his young master brood in his unending torment .
a thunder shook the manor yet he felt that the game of cat and mouse that his friend had played for far too long was finally undoing him .
ever the care giver he filled his cup with a bit more scotch and said yes it does need to end as all things need to when their time comes . ''
he knew alfred would be diplomatic as he knew he would have to take drastic measures to bring his pain to an end .
after alfred filled his cup he emptied it and pointed a gun at him .
alfred was worried about his young charge even though the man was old enough to be considered middle aged yet he had never seen him take up a gun .
pointing a gun at me after you 've fired me is a terrible pun master wayne '' he said .
thunder lightning rain wind whiskey hearth smoke and anger alfred 's ear was shot off .
after alfred stumbled down onto the ground he got up and emptied the six shooter around his head .
once the gun was empty of the promise that he so longed for he pressed the hot barrel against alfred 's head go back to britain .
live your last days with your old family . ''
he got up dusted himself off and considered the child that he raised as his own son .
he walked over to the clock pulled the lever and said but i will always be at your leave . ''
as the secret opening revealed itself alfred left his young master to brood in his drunken stupor .
it began to hail outside but with an umbrella and a prayer he walked to his car and took one last look at the empty house of wayne .

dp has always been a mmr machine at sub 2k because new players dont know how to deal with pushing or ratting
it also put zerg on a timer and at no point were they cost efficient in the match up .
zerg 's were trying to trade anything for a couple of key units while expanding harassing with mutas where possible and getting every possible upgrade while the terran sat back built the deathball on three bases .
it was n't a good match up to watch or play .
for extra amusement the function gets repurposed to use a function variable through external calls and then everything breaks because the crazy halfass bug fix is specific to the original usage .
i remember the first time i ever went to a concert without either of my parents but instead with my sister we went to go see incubus on the morning view tour or shortly after .
and then incubus got like two songs were playing nice to know you and then all the fucking people up front with my sister and i in the nosebleeds fucking brought down the barricade in front of the stage they stopped the concert and then no music for like an hour .
and when i tell this story sometimes people do n't believe me because who the fuck moshes down a barricade at an incubus concert ?

quick question why would they make something split screen if it was with ai characters ?
they wouldnt they would just put the ai character in the main screen .
there is no doubt they are doing split screen online multiplayer .
if they included dlc and got on some sort of release schedule for additional games i would be onboard .
i was also there.. he was a bit different and he sat a great deal of the time ...

i 'm a photoshop user myself so i could n't tell you anything specific but it essentially comes down to just using the software regularly to get used to it 's capabilities .
i 'd highly suggest trying to learn keyboard shortcuts as they drastically cut down on your time spent in your workflow simply switching tool .
think if you had to move to a different room to use a new tool in real life .
having efficient keyboard shortcut usage is the equivalent of placing that tool down on your desk and picking a new one up .
so that 's how i would start to use a new program by learning the keyboard shortcuts .
possibly a stock image used by the woman selling it .
a balanced mix of single-core and total processor power with both being as fast as you can get .
the official minimum spec is a 4590 and that 's not going to produce huge bottlenecks .
but you should really aim for the slightly faster 4690k and overclock overclocked 4790k is better overclocked skylake 6700k best .
skylake is n't that much faster at stock but is overclocking somewhat farther than devil 's canyon on average due to the die shrink .
your mileage may vary consult a doctor before using product .
the thing about bad players is that they win about 50 of their games .
so if you do something really bad and stupid like bounty hunter carry with 5 battlefury you will 50 .
the games they get to 5 battlefury they think omg this is so strong i am so pro '' the other 50 they blame their team .

you do need pro to import other people 's komponents but all other features are present in the free version .
the kustom live wallpaper is only really needed when you want to use some super special animations .

until then posts involving him will stay unless any of the other mods disagree .
until he is charged with a crime this sub will continue to support whatever porn the majority of women like .

at some point you will have to realise abandoning human liberty to embracing the state as a means to solve problems only offsets risk in a manner that compounds it in the hands of those with the strongest record of literal democidal megadeath both terms who 's existence is owed to the nessesity of describing the type and scale of murder only achieveable by the state .
the progeny of those that embrace it are at greater risk than than those that by degree recognise it 's inherent and immutable danger .
these cowboys dim sense of what is happening to them is lightyears beyond the typical neolib and in that regard their minarchism is something i can appreciate more than your poor attempt to reflect my own words back on me .
those men have mixed their labour with lands that the federal government has attempted to steal on more than a few occassions from more than a few people .
having actually worked their own lands represents a far more legitimate property claim than the real estate frauds the state has foisted on its subjects by claiming all allodial title to itself .
accepting such foundational fraud as normative makes you more of a slave on the outside than they will ever be a prisoner on the inside .
these people recognizing that the state does not honor its own terms is at least something .
the selective enforcement against backburns represents clear corruption especially considering the government prosecuting them has determined such actually improved the value of those plots the federal government claims was damaged in the defensive burn .
in the cases the feds do the same their own men go completely unpunished for the exact same or far worse acts even it it burns down houses and property .

nypd is currently testing a few different systems and styles of body cameras they have one that mounts to oakleys one mounted to a should and one mounted to the chest .
they are trying to evaluate what will work best across the entire department .
lets say 5 years from now hypothetical date after they 've picked their body cam provider created policies and made the necessary deals on the retrieval end this will either be free probably just for those directly involved or cost a much more objectively reasonable fee to news sources .
if we extremely low balled the daily workforce to 8,000 uniformed patrol officers and limited body cams to them only and the policy was to film at all times on patrol that would end up being roughly 22 years of footage per day .
so that could also be a reason for this being so costly especially in these early stages .

ukraine as all bad for cutting power to crimea but when russia cuts the gas to ukraine they say it is well done and nobody cares for the elder and the children .
just because russia pays for the electricity does n't mean ukraine wants to keep supplying it .
in fact lots of electricity in ukraine is generated by gas so since ukraine is reducing dependence on russian gas that russia likes to use as political weapon it is wise to save on electricity .
and i ca n't see the existence of a brain behind the idea that ukraine is punishing crimea when it is doing what it is in the right to do .
but russia intervention in ukraine is just a legitimate defense of its interest and not a punishment on ukrainians for wanting to turn west .

lovies philosophy is what caused the scheme to fail .
carolina and seattle run a much more aggressive philosophy .
i 'd say that r/diyelectronics strives to be a little more amateur-friendly and fun '' than r/electronics .
in particular i 'm noticing a lot of people that are already doing diy stuff but want to integrate electronic components into their projects .
with arduino and raspberry pi becoming popular the barrier of entry for digital electronics is lower than ever and i 'd like for r/diyelectronics to cater to that audience .
obviously r/diyelectronics welcomes advanced professionals as well but for them we 'll have a focus on monthly challenges and side projects rather than the q a threads we see over at r/electronics .
i 'm working with a number of people to run some of the more advanced challenges .
i 'll be sure to add this to the faq backlog .

japan has had a long history of relations with taiwan and that is not a fact that will change .
we have de-facto recognition of taiwan but as you know we do not have de-jure recognition for complicated reasons .

the halo franchise while there were plans and apparently even a steve jobs press announcement about the game at something called macworld i think the article said it was talked about at about halo nothing from halo was released until after microsoft scooped up bungie.. so they got to keep their engine but microsoft got the halo ip ... which is what it really wanted ... microsoft could always have their own people code a new engine ... but i think they did both if i remember right ...
i think they licensed the existing halo engine back from bungie and made changes to it or working in the background on a new halo engine while using the old one ... i forget now .
still despite all the hostility ... they seem to still have a good working relationship ... they ended up still releasing destiny on xbox consoles when it was going to be a ps and ps4 exclusive at one point and a lot of bungie people work at 343 now either staying behind or going back there after the split bungie was contracted to help 343 ship halo reach because they werent ready to take over fully yet..
and apparently 343 is just the new name of that studio ... apparently it began life as bungie west '' but only released one fairly unsuccessful game and got renamed to 343 and just worked in the background doing extra work for the halo franchise .
let me know if im missing some errors or if this is fine or anything .
ive taken into consideration what you told me so all my plans are put into ths one thread .
or just run a 1/4 cup white vinegar with your regular laundry .
a lot of what they will be doing is gathering resources and assets .
they got ta procure money ammunition armaments bases and equipment .
finding a decent base good take a chapter while a lot of those other things could be acquired during raids your characters undertake also taking up a chapter .
then you get to the more interesting type of assets .
you have to find wealthy sponsors of the cause you have to have specialists in virtually every field and having moles in the enemy camp is always nice .
a lot of chapters will be focused on these things while others will be about a series of escalating strikes .
it is always nice to have moments where the reader and character can relax .
show the camaraderie between your characters show them being friends show us their relationships .
at the same time suspense is a nice thing to instill .
maybe there is a traitor amongst them maybe one of their strikes has some civilians caught in the crossfire .
make them question their crusade even if only for a moment .

free range means nearly nothing as this photo shows .

so no you still have intensively confined debeaked animals who are killed at less than a quarter of their lives .
and the females are still laying a painful amount of eggs 20x their wild ancestors and their most common cause of death is related issues .
so no you do n't care about these animals or their welfare if you buy humane organic free range '' eggs .

and and i told don too because they 've moved my desk four times already this year and i used to be over by the window and i could see the squirrels and they were merry married but then they switched from the swingline to the boston stapler but i kept my swingline stapler because it did n't bind up as much and i kept the staples for the swingline stapler and it 's not okay because if they take my stapler then i 'll set the building on fire ...

i think even nissan spent a fortune building battery factories on 3 different continents and then said they can get a better deal just buying from http insideevs.com/nissan-ceo-best-battery-maker-lg-chem lg http insideevs.com/lg-chem-looks-clinch-battery-contract-next-gen-nissan-leaf .
in relation to how much of the car lg chem is responsible for i found this http www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2015/10/20/gm-credits-lg-chem-creating-much-chevy-bolt/74278562
in a break with the past general motors acknowledged today that lg chem did n't only supply batteries for the 2017 chevrolet bolt but another arm of the south korean supplier co-developed the electric car 's climate controls electric-drive motor power electronics and dashboard displays and infotainment system .
i saw some interviews where some of the top/chief engineers at chevy were asked about the car and they talked about things like the way the door sils were notched or how much trunk room there was and they basically talked about the frame and/or the challenges of working with people from all over the world namely seoul .
i do n't think i saw exec chief engineer pam fletcher or chief engineer josh tavel say much about the technology involved .
when someone builds something and then gets asked questions about their creation it 's pretty easy to tell how involved they were and i could tell from their answers something was off .
i have no problem with lg co-developing the car i love lg but now i understand why i got that vibe from the gm employee interviews .
it 's totally unrelated to ev but this guy https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ma7rr3fzy-a put a v8 in an exocent kit and is selling it .
watching him talk about the car he knows every single detail of the car watching gm engineers talk about the bolt felt a little like people with the level of familiarity with the vehicle that a sales guy would have with it .
this is already too long but that was bothering me and now i know why .

four college girls hold up a restaurant in order to fund their spring break vacation .
while partying/drinking/taking drugs they are arrested only to be bailed out by a drug and arms dealer .
from what i can gather people thought the show became pretentious .
season six even though it has a handful of really big plot developments is closer to some kind of abstract mood piece than the story-filled season five .
people did n't think moynihan 's philosophical ruminations had any place in a show called adventure time and the fact that the other storyboarders followed suit only exacerbated things .
when you go back and look at the season there are comparatively very few episodes which could be described as adventurous '' even leaving out moynihan 's strangeness .
not everybody was on board for so much experimentation it 's one thing to introduce some ongoing plot and some emotional drama into a geeky cartoon and another to introduce melancholy ambiguous existentialism .
all that to say it 's my favorite season to date .
but i can understand why it was n't for everybody .
that 's a big part of why i admire it so much it was very risky to not only have so much seriousness but to mix in less and less silliness so that the ideas they were talking about had the gravity they deserved .
they risked alienating a huge portion of their fanbase and unfortunately they did .
it paid off in one of he most extraordinary seasons of television in recent memory but it whittled down its audience to the people who like fantasy cartoons and james joyce which is perhaps a smaller demographic than it should be .
thx for this post as everytime i think pay 2x more for a surfacebook gawd do i really want a windows 10 only device and the virus protection that entails or maybe a pretty much same price dell chromebook 13 touchscreen chromebook ends up same price almost as a pixel2 when maxed out and now razer come up with actually best competitor a touchscreen qhd or 4k ultrabook at 999 1500 with an additional usb-c video card that can power multiple 4k monitors yes pls.. all 3 of these portables have me lusting.. but none more than pixel2 ls.. as for couple years my primary portable device outside a maxed apple desktop is a c720 i3 4gb and also a asus chromebox 8gb ram.. both of which are so damn fast.. prob a 3.5-4secs bootup and they just fly so fast.. while the pixel2 ls would not just fly but hammer fast .
and then u have the real industrial design not like my plasticky acer.. plus having used a surface pro 3 i want the touchscreen.. and to me laptops around 12 inch the perfect size.. so this post makes me want the pixel 2 again ... but a 4k razer ultrabook and desktop video card calls too.. but the razer they fkd up and only went to 8gb ram tho everything else spec wise is spot on and price is tight ... btw what is your preferred email program on pixel2 ls ?
and any other extensions/apps/programs u use and how is the touchscreen compared to not having one etc ?
i would assume that one would be for reverse polarity protection .
the other two are probably for buck and boost functions .
it may be negative voltage because nfets tend to have a lower rds on than pfets .
yeah i will try my hardest now in school and hopefully everything recovers .

most seem to be frustrated about the fact that the game was n't what they expected .
most saw a sandbox mmo with tons of possibilities when it turned out to be a huge grindfest i personally do n't mind the grind but i get why some people do .
personally i think its their fault for falling for the hype and their own misconceptions .
granted the game somewhat advertised itself as something that i believe is only slightly to what it offered .
but the objects of most of the complaints namely the combat and the grind could have been figured out with a simple google search .
blowing those all those chance to come away with crap and probably a first/second round loss at the aussie now that you 've expended yourself ?
i think it must be a us thing i 've never heard of anyone having one in the uk and even if i had i do n't want one i do n't feel like we need one and i feel like it would be one more thing to worry about .
it 's quite a new and alien concept to me .
quite ok with doing paper invites and just answering people 's questions if they have them .
i also feel like a lot of our friends/family either would n't understand the idea and would just rsvp via phone or mail or in person anyway as is the done thing here and the whole website would be a waste of time .
edit to add also we are n't having a registry or any kind of info that people will need that wo n't be on the invites fairly small wedding everyone who is staying over at the wedding venue has already booked in etc .

sommige jongeren vervelen zich nu ook op straat en gaan het criminele pad op .
heb liever dat ze zich leren te vervelen bij defensie daar in de fout gaan en flink worden bestraft dan dat het op straat gebeurt .
sommige hebben daarbij nogal wat hiaten in hun opvoeding een ongezond gebrek aan respect voor autoriteit en de samenleving .
het leger zou daar wellicht nog wat in kunnen veranderen want de straffen straatcoaches en het knuffelen wil niet echt helpen .
maar aan de andere kant is het ook weer gevaarlijk deze groep jongeren wapenkennis te geven ... een echt dilemma .
maar dat is sowieso voor een beperkte groep voor mensen die willen studeren is het slechts een vervelende vertraging .

i think it does if it works the way i think it takes the median value for every pixel between all the pictures .
this means it will take the color that repeats most often among all the pictures .
as long as no one in the picture was standing still for more than half the time you where taking pictures the median value would be the background .

there is game with really not much blood being spileld but this can be explained by teams not knowing exactly when to pick fights .
also drake and rift herald are not that big anymore so no bloobath or exiting fights happening there .
give it more time it 's gon na get interesting again if they give back those objectives some importance and teams knowing themselves more and more willing to pick fights .
that will depend on what you both are into .
for me a threesome with another woman is completely out of the question .
i 've never been into women and thus the idea is a total sexual turnoff .
we both have zero interest to be in a sexual situation with the same sex .
but if your girlfriend is generally fine with that and jealousy is the actual problem then maybe you could agree on a script '' for the whole encounter who does what to whom what are total no-gos etc. so nothing that happens will cause feelings of jealousy for her .
a bit of sifting reveals that j-list has a few of them .
the ones that remove notes and cancel bpm changes will make a score false .
ah yes back then i thought it was gon na be some shitty furry fanservice .

i 'm not sure the dalai lama ever met an isis suicide bomber .
yeah any info would be great it would be a pretty awesome find if there is one out in the wild .
i did have a thought that it was maybe part or a promotional press kit so there must be at least a few around .
what is interesting is that acclaim had a history of coloured cartridges with the turok series and some of their sports titles .
i can only assume that nintendo were not happy with an adult game being promoted with a brightly coloured cartridge but that 's just a theory i think i 've spent more time thinking about this than its worth .
interesting find with the oot prototype would make a great post if you find out any more info .
something i 've also learnt over the years is its not what you know it 's who you know .

copying android 's notification bar is n't the bad part here .
it 's an extremely convenient thing and really improves the user experience on any platform .
it 's the suing android device makers '' that was pedantic greedy and stupid on behalf of apple .
you either do n't copy features from others and do n't let them copy yours or copy from them and do n't throw a hissy fit when they do the same .
the end result of mutual copying is beneficial for the user base the one that pays you money .
they do n't need to just take away the excess before it 's baked and mix it in with some other unbaked dough .
you do n't need anyone else to be impressed because you 're impressed enough for everyone !

the regen ability means that suntide kills hailstone when attacking first 100 of the time assuming generals do n't interfere .
3 attack is decent because most early minions have 3 health .
there is some benefit to not having to attack with your hero to kill rejuvenators but consider the fact that suntide maiden is virtually infinite value as long as the enemy has no way to clear it .
suntide is better against lots of smaller units golem is better against medium creatures .
suntide gives you a ton of value if not dealt with the golem is just there .
it 's 3 free damage in most cases and then it gets removed .
personally i believe that if the meta was slower and general health less important suntides would be run in all lyonar decks .

military ships are usually substantially smaller than commercial ships so what you are doing with you shipyards is pretty normal i would say .

so with the texans probably dropping foster which running backs on the roster do you think we 'll retain and which ones would you guys like to see us pick up in the upcoming draft ?
my take if i had to pick two backs i 'd keep on the roster i 'd probably end up with grimes and hunt then drop the rest .
grimes because i think he performed better for the allotted time on field than blue or polk did .
i 'd keep hunt around because he showed some pretty decent flashes over this season .
i 'd like to see more before i write him off .
as for the draft i 'd love to see the texans draft deandre washington texas tech university because i think he 'd work well in the shotgun heavy scheme of bob .
he catches well and runs very well in open spaces my concerns about him though are pass blocking and how he does in a semi zone blocking scheme .
lost two hours of progress due to the affinity chart bug a bug which people had a month or so already .
18f here that struggles severely from seasonal affective disorder .
i was diagnosed 5-6 years ago with it and ever since have been trying to analyze my emotions and figure out if there is a pattern .
i thought i had it pretty figured out because usually i would start being impacted at the mid-end of december i 'd start experiencing feelings of apathy that would gradually become more continuous and noticeable .
then by the end of january i 'd start to feel depressed just lose a general interest in practically everything .
it is january 17th and i have been experiencing suicidal thoughts all week .
i honestly had n't thought i had even started to feel depressed yet but it hit me like a wave and i feel extreme worthlessness hopelessness laziness sadness guilt etc .
i also have been having troubles falling asleep and staying asleep for about 1.5 weeks now .
i thought it was from stress or something but even if i have no responsibilities for the following day i will lay in bed tossing and turning for about 5-6 hours .
often once i fall asleep i will wake up multiple times and have difficulties falling back asleep .
i feel as though i have no one to talk to because i do not have many friends and the ones i do have are not as understanding as i would hope them to be which i feel rude for saying but they just think i can snap out of these feelings which i really try to do but it is a process .
i try to use my special lamp as much as i can i have been exercising trying to improve my diet and going to bed at earlier times which obviously has been failing .
on top of all this i had my first panic attack since i was 10 in november now both that attack and the one i had when i was 10 were from traumatic situations but recently the whole month of january i have been experiencing attacks that are about 15mins long and involve a lot of hyperventilating sweats hot flashes sharp pains in my chest and shaking .
i looked them up online and every article seemed to mention that they tend to cause people to create a fear of things and they start to avoid certain situations in fear of having another attack so i have been trying to fight that but i will say when i first had one i stopped seeing my mom for 2 weeks because even thinking about her due to traumatic experience that involved both of us made me feel extreme anxiety which made me feel nauseated .
i also have noticed that drinking coffee which i have always drank has been causing my anxiety to skyrocket so i have been avoiding it as much as i can .
now i 'm not asking for a mental evaluation although if you can offer that or suggest anywhere i can go to get help for this i would greatly appreciate it .
but over all i am really just looking for someone to talk to as a friend .

i just had a game where my opponent was afk the entire game but ... i was still raging my pants off .
i have a hunter deck with 17 attack '' cards 14 minions 3 weps and 13 spells
i just drew until i had 8 spell cards in my hand initial hand before reroll also had 3 spell cards so i had this i bet he will come back and freaking win '' idea at the back of my mind the entire game .
how on earth can you miss over half your deck for so long .
should i sacrifice a goat or a cat or something to make my luck turn ?
got offered this karambit i think it 's one of the worst fire ice right ?

they had sent rockets to destroy the asteroid before it collided but it ended up multiplying the number of collisions .
the end involves going back in time and convincing the people in charge of that decision to not send the rockets .
before the end stuff happens in a desert and in some sort of scientific station .
i think one of the main characters belongs to the station the other to the desert .

first off i just want to apologize because i have little memory of this game.i think this game was played on the play station platform ps1 maybe .
i had it near the same time that i got the first jak and daxter .
i really only remember that there was a jet pack mission and a mission where you are on a train .
i also believe he had dreadlocks or maybe cornrows he might have had orange hair ? ? ?
i know this is extremely vague and i apologize once again .
so everyone says that when a studio or production company buys a script they buy the entire concept and the unlimited rights to use it forever in all ways .
this is always the case ever since fox bought star wars but did n't buy everything .
let 's say i write both novels and screenplays .
i wrote a novel and hayhouse is publishing it .
i also wrote a script version of the same story and disney is buying it .
i 've already sold the publishing rights to hayhouse .
if disney wants to make the movie they can only buy the film rights as i do n't have the book publishing rights anymore .
i know production companies always buy everything but what if this this the case ?
i ca n't decide what are the pros and cons of each champion and what do you prefer personally ?
i was thinking about how naruto is being continued by boruto now .
but i would have very much preferred if there was a time skip of around a 100 years in which now naruto and sasuke were the legendary ninjas just how hashirama was during naruto 's days .
would n't that have made a more better plotline and maybe we could have had flashbacks to show how naruto as a hokage inspired the whole ninja world .
and different sets of villains because the time has overly changed ?
i just want someone to save me from this misery .
i 'm exhausted all teh time but have to keep working and getting up and doing things every single day .
i do n't even get a single day of just sleep and relaxation and even if i did i do n't think i could relax knowing that i have to yet again go to work .
i honestly do n't think that life is good .
i 'm not going to kill myself but ido n't really have any hope for the future either .
life just seems like this crushing mass of responsibility .
the thing is that i do n't even work that much 30 hours per week but its minimum wage as a busboy .
i have a degree and everything but life is just so excruciatingly difficult .
i wish that i was like a logical robot that could just do tasks like phone 20 places for new jobs but instead i 'm this weak squishy thing that finds it difficult to even go to the grocery store or get a haircut .
it 's like i just want to lie down and not wake back up .
i look around me and i do n't think that i 'm ever really going to be happy .
i 'll have bits and moments but i do n't think i can afford to not work anymore or even any less than i do now as i am just barely scraping by .
i feel extremely grateful to live in a first world country but its almost like teasing me with the notion of being comfortable .
or even work 1 week and get 2 off or something .
i 'm happy and healthy when i do n't work .
last time i did n't work and was unemployed i was in the best shape of my life but i ca n't go to the gym after being on my feet for 7 hours .
i know people want to offer solutions as if there is some neat way to tie up this package but i think i just might be in a shitty situaton as most of us are .
there 's no solution here and i 'm giving up or have almost completely given up on any optimism i had for my own future .
i did some research online and have n't been able to find anyone posting pics of the results of this before so figured although it 's a pretty minor thing it might be useful for brewing noobs like me .
i have brewed two 5 gallon batches both extract only the first was an ipa kit the second was john palmer 's cincinnati pale ale .
i carbonated both using cooper 's carbonation drops because this seemed to be the easiest way to do it with least risk of messing up .
problem was i have 500ml bottles whereas cooper 's carbonation drops are designed for 330ml bottles their instructions say to use 2 drops for 750ml bottles so for a 500ml bottle i figured the ideal dose would be 1.5 per bottle .
rather than mess around trying to cut drops in half i decided to make it into a little experiment .
for the first batch i was cautious and used 1 drop per bottle .
it turned out a little flat only a slight fizz to it .
for the second batch i went for 2 drops per bottle .
it was much more fizzy closer to what you 'd expect when opening a bottle of lager so perhaps too gassy for some ale styles but it seemed to me to work well with the pale ale style .
hopefully this will be a useful point of reference for anyone else encountering the dilemma i had .
i am pleased to report that both batches were highly drinkable and am currently hungover after a night of guzzling the second batch ...

hi all i just finished playing through oxenfree a fantastic atmospheric horror game focused around a group of teenagers .
i 've been inspired and have all kinds of ideas bubbling around about how to run a game in that style .
however i ca n't seem to find a good system that fits my needs .
pc 's should be average teenagers with the potential to develop supernatural powers .
the game should be set in the modern era within the past 20-30 years or so .
the game should be focused more around exploration and puzzle-solving with room for the characters to enter combat with horrors .

whenever i do a job interview i do a lot of research to try to figure out who would be my supervisor in that position .
i then print out a picture of them i find from social media and i masturbate onto the picture immediately prior to the job interview .
masturbating onto a picture of somebody has a good psychological trick of making you feel dominant and confident over them which is very helpful in an interview .
you can do this same thing to the picture of anyone for any situation in which you want to feel less nervous .
it 's also hard to take somebody seriously as a threat when you know you ejaculated all over their photo and they have no idea .
i do it right before an interview and do not wash my hands .
at the holiday party i got a bit tipsy and i told my boss about my strategy .
he became very puzzled and asked me if i had masturbated onto his picture .
he seemed concerned so i told him it was n't a gay thing it was n't sexual it was just a psychological trick for interviews .
i told him i also masturbate on his picture prior to any performance review meeting .
anyways i have some sort of meeting with hr on monday .
yes i 'm going to masturbate onto a picture of the hr manager beforehand but no i wo n't bring it up in the meeting .
i am ashamed i told him about this though .
it 's a solid interview strategy and nothing will ever stop me from doing it or make me even consider not doing it but i will never tell anyone about it again .
tl dr told by boss i ejaculate on his picture .
i 'm 105 but when i got to 100 it basically prestiged me .

we are now playing around with excel to turn this into some beautiful graphs for y'all .
after 2015 's survey was skipped this old habit is returning 2016 's survey has arrived and it takes about 5 minutes to fill out all the questions .
if this survey gets as many responses as the previous ones i am confident we 'll get quite some interesting data from it .
i have some ideas of what statistics to expect but i 'm sure there will also be some surprising results in there .
in a while once we have a high number of responses i will use some excel qlikview magic to turn this data into comprehensible charts for everyone to see .
page 4 questions for people who started as a regular relationship then became long-distance .
page 5 and 6 about how you closed the distance if you have closed it !
people who have already closed the distance please answer with how things were when you were still in long distance .
a little shout-out to u/ellybethe u/zqom and u/catsterrr for the help with compiling the questions and making the survey look good and to u/professorshanks for letting me take this over from him .
to address some issues i 've added a page for questions aimed towards people who started as close-distance and became long-distance .
the original survey had pretty much no focus on this kind of situations but it should be better now .
update one week after posting the surveys 815 people have submitted their responses !
that 's a really nice number to start working with .
i will be analyzing the results and trying to create some nice statistics from them .
meanwhile the survey remains open for everyone to respond to .
the results should be ready in a couple of weeks .
thank you all so much for responding to the survey !
i 've got 5 adafruit cc3000 wifi shields on a closed local network hosted by an apple airport express that are attempting to communicate over mqtt to a local broker .
it seems that i am unable to have more than one cc3000 on my network at a time .
i 've tested this by running two arduinos with external power with the adafruit cc3000 library buildtest '' example https github.com/adafruit/adafruit_cc3000_library/blob/master/examples/buildtest/buildtest.ino and only one will reach the stage where it is on the network and pingable .
i 've configured the network to 802.11/b/g from 802.11/n because the datasheet mentions that it supports b or g but not n. i 've also assigned each cc3000 with a static ip address on the network based off their mac addresses on the router .
i also upgraded the firmware of the boards but that caused mqtt to behave erratically .
does anyone have any idea why more than one cc3000 can not reliably connect to a network at a time ?
just tried make an unsecured guest network '' on the airport express and connecting the devices through that to my broker .
the result was different the two units could connect to the network but one the mqtt streams stopped .
in the pings which makes me think that for some reason the router thinks the two devices are the same one .
i 'm one of the many people who were inspired to run after reading born to run .
i started my journey in late 2014 and since then i 've lost over 80 pounds .
as far as running exprience is concerned i have 3 half-marathons and one marathon under my belt .
i plan on doing 4 more half marathons and one marathon this year .
keep in mind that i can finish the distance but just not very fast .
my half marathon time is around 2:20 and finished my marathon in 5:3-something .
i plan on doing the same marathon race in october this year and would like to complete a 50k that will take place two weeks after .
do you guys think this is possible for me ?
i 've researched several training programs which are similar to marathon programs .

while the personal computer business overall contracted another 8 to 11 in 2015 apple continued to grow shipments of its mac line one of only two manufacturers in the top five to do so throughout the year according to estimates from researchers idc and gartner .
mac shipments in 2015 increased by about 6 compared to the year before idc and gartner both concluded .
the only other oem to boost sales last year was asus which according to idc grew its shipments by 1 .
apple will disclose its fourth-quarter mac sales figures on jan. 26 when it holds its next earnings call with wall street .
if idc 039 s and gartner 039 s projections for the cupertino calif. company 039 s mac shipments are accurate apple will have set a fourth-quarter record for computer sales .
apple will need to beat the idc and gartner estimates to establish a new single-quarter record for mac sales as both firms 039 forecasts for the fourth quarter are below the current record of 5.7 million macs sold in the september 2015 quarter .
mac shipments bucked the industry 039 s trend even though their prices remain significantly higher than the average .

i 've recently ran into problems with my gpu ending in it pretty much not working .
long story short booting my computer in anything but safe mode leads to a bsod as soon as the graphics card kicks in right after trying to load the windows logo .
ergo i 'm replacing my old graphics card with a long overdue fresh part .
the psu should be able to handle it the 970 uses 5 less watts
the 560 uses pci-express 2.0 x16 with 2x peg6 the 970 uses pci-express 3.0 x16 with 2x peg8 .
the 970 is a little over 2 '' longer than the 560 .
the 970 outperforms the 560 in every aspect as expected .
i 've only ever build my current pc and i did that with massive help of a seasoned vet .
this would be my first build even if it 's just replacing a part that i would do all by myself .
my old graphics card was connected to the pcu using 2 pci-express cables with peg8 on one end going into the psu and peg6+2 on the other end the 6 going into the gpu .
i 've been told i need to uninstall current graphics drivers to avoid conflicts before installing the new card .
from what i 've read the 970 has great performance and good bang-for-your-buck .
from what i understand this is safe and should not cause any problems .
but since i 've never overclocked anything.. is this correct ?
are there any other things i need to keep in mind ?
i 've already removed the old card reinstalled and removed it again as practice .
i 'm catching up on hillary 's superpac health records demand debacle and wondering if this is a ploy to have mud thrown as an opportunity to roll in tonight with some extended olive branch .

i went vegan in the new year so it 's been two and half weeks .
i really do n't want it to be the change in my diet but nothing else in my life has changed other than i 've cut down significantly on cigarettes .
i was vegetarian for ten years before 2016 and slowly fased out a lot of eggs and egg products over the years so the change to my diet has n't been radical all i 've really done is drop dairy .
the strangest part is my so is getting back into body building but doing it vegan this time so he 's counting all his carbs proteins fats fibre etc and because we cook for each other/have the same meals by proxy i am also counting mine and i know i 'm getting enough of everything .
today i got out of bed at about 10:30 am had baked beans two vegan sausages two hash browns and a black coffee with one sugar for breakfast .
by 12:30 pm i 'm falling asleep on the sofa .
i struggle with depression and whatnot and i know what that tiredness feels like .
while there 's still a physical aspect to it a lot of it is emotional and mental lethargy .
this is n't that it 's not boredom either .
my eyes are heavy my legs are weak i 'm yawning i have no energy i 'm tired !
if it is my diet change is it just my body getting used to it or is there something i am doing wrong/missing/not getting enough of ?
if it 's not my diet what is it !
hi guys friday i 'm going to spend the day in london .
i 'm really excited because there are almost no vegan restaurant in my town .
however i 'm only going two or three meals including breakfast .
london offers so many options i just wanted to know which one are the best .

i just arrived in dublin for the week and was wondering if there was anything going on this evening sunday the 17th that some dubliners would recommend ?
i wandered around the city for the past few hours and am now at jw sweetman 's for lunch .
i believe very strongly in buddhism but there is a lot i take on faith particularly rebirth and karma .
i went in learning about buddhism very skeptically from an open-minded atheist standpoint and there 's still stuff i do n't really accept like devas and the many realms .
for much of my life i 've been very depressed and self-harming with a worldview that i 'm not better off alive .
i 've acted on those convictions several times and through chance survived those events .
buddhism has helped me very much in moving away from that worldview but i have wavered in my faith in rebirth and one of the aforementioned events stemmed from that .
in my view buddhism without karma and rebirth leads to a strong affirming of my old belief that i 'm better off dead .
what brought this up is that my therapist tried to get me to promise 3 months of me not killing myself and i ended up promising 2 weeks .
because i 'm not sure i can keep up my conviction that buddhism really is true and does n't just have some good ideas to lure you in then when you 're invested buttresses them with unsupported claims .
i need something to help me keep my faith that the buddha 's words were n't twisted or that he was wrong in some way or maybe even that the buddha was never really enlightened .

one is a construction company i 'll call company a .
then i have another company called company b. i own both companies but company a is building a building for company b ... .ok ... so
when i need funding for the building in company a i create an invoice and put it under company b 's job name within company a .
then i send the invoice from company a to the bank and they deposit the funds in company b 's checking account .
i create a journal entry in company b to reflect the deposit .
so now i have the funds i need and i need to transfer those funds to company a .
then i write a check from company b to company a for the amount .
then i deposit the check into company a 's account and goto the invoice and receive payment .

the d3300 http www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00hq4w1qe/ref=s9_ri_bw_g421_i1 ? pf_rd_m=atvpdkikx0der pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-9 pf_rd_r=1zfsetgfwpd6sdvcj9e0 pf_rd_t=101 pf_rd_p=1973731842 pf_rd_i=3017941 or the d3200 http www.bestbuy.com/site/nikon-d3200-dslr-camera-with-18-55mm-vr-ii-and-55-200mm-vr-ii-lenses-black/4449701.p ? id=1219748972958 skuid=4449701 .
the 3200 comes with the 55-200mm lens for the same price as the 3300 that only comes with the 18-55mm lens .
can anyone try to persuade me which is a better deal ?
i am hoping not to spend over 400 so that is why i am deciding between these two .
i saw the stickers go insanely up in price and then go down .
do you think they will steady out at a price or continue to rise in price ?
as many of you know the playoff recap challenge event rttp is back tomorrow for the divisional round .

this is my first map ever so i would appreciate any input or suggestions !
thought about this tonight ... jeff janis had 101 receiving yards on a single drive not even counting his 15-yard kickoff return !
has it ever happened that a rusher or receiver has gone over 100 yards in a single drive ?
we of course know teams do happens several times a year .
qb 's prolly do on passing yards fairly often too .
i think sam bradford might have have two 100 yard passing drives in a single game this year needs verification .
but before tonight ... has a rusher or receiver ever done that in a verifiable manner ?
quick dirty research on the internet 5 minutes is n't coming up with much .

this has happened to me for two winters in a row !
ive found the only way i can make it better is by consuming large amounts of anti-oxidant drinks like jasmine tea rooibos tea and the occasional kombucha

i 'm lately having alot of problems with my diabetes in the gym .
i start my workout with around 170 if you use a different scale 80-120 is normal and over the course of lifting i would go down enough to start feeling low .
one time i even almost passed out before i could reach my drink which is in the locker room .
post-workout and when i get home i 'll usually be around 250 because i drank alot which just makes everything complicated..
i use an insulin pump and i take 1.2 unit every hour .
should i disconnect my pump say two hours before the workout and then i wo n't be low when working out ?
what do you guys do to avoid getting low ?
i have a nexus 6 with the google now launcher .
i typed an address like facebook.com and it opened chrome and went there .
the title says it all i want to get better so i can win more tournaments but i do n't know what to do and i often get punished for trying to do things that do n't work .
i had a guy friend recently make a joke that he wanted to go to a party just to see boobs and butts .
i think it bothers me help me find the words/response to explain why this bothers me .
hello everyone it 's been a while since my posted videos of being salty while also being banned from eic .
but i want to say it has been a week since the shit hit the fan and now i want to ask you guys something .
i had joined many groups after the deal with catnip an eic .
so after a couple days off playing elite dangerous with people in sdc and working i was given this picture http imgur.com/6h557tb
supposedly i 'm a stream sniper and have killed members of this group .
with catnip giving me the idea i mean sure it is elite dangerous after all .
all i want to say is because i joined sdc i 'm supposedly all these things .
if anyone who is new to this line of work an were thinking of joining a group just remember this stuff is not so much role play but mostly drama .
all right people of the comment section let the posting begin !
filling up my blood echos so i can buy a lot of stuff before i move onto the shadows .
just finished 11/22/63 planning on finishing it early february around when the show comes out but could n't put it down .
so far i 'd say it the stand and 11/22/63 are my 3 favorites .
mines is 4k but i already reached 4k then i said let me reach 3.5k
not sure if this pertains only to bo3 because it 's the only multiplayer game i own but i ca n't hear anyone in game even though i see the chat speaker appear .
but it seems like i can talk in chat but not sure if other people can hear me .
i 've tried resetting my xbox but and there do n't seem to be any controller updates so i 'm not really sure how to fix this

message me here or on kik under same name .
i 'm a 30 player looking for others to play with on regular basis i 'm located on us westcoast .
over the years i 've asked a few times which framework are the best '' .
this question never fails to stir up a lot of opinionated though experienced feedback and i 'm never sold on one framework .
it seems especially for the small scale of my projects that almost any will do .
it seems that all that matters at least for my scale of projects is whether or not the community or owners of the frameworks are continuing to move forward and which framework i already have a decent understanding of in terms of concepts .
for example i 've become a mediocre magento developer over the last year which has vaguely familiarized me with zend .
if i 'm already rolling down the zend path why detour ?
for some reason foc is completely fading out when the music stops for even a small second and it looks very strange .
there does n't seem to be a setting in the setup window that will fix it so is there any ini file i can edit that would help ?
sorry for the terrible gif not used to editing and rendering in blender .
i was watching some informative videos on how to smoke certain spots in dust 2 https gyazo.com/99e3c89ff7abebad9debf8d0a1b0371d and i noticed that my shadows appear to be really light https gyazo.com/203fa5b149d51ea3d278720c649fc637 compared to the video .
both the video and the game was seen on the same monitor .
i already tried changing some in-game color settings/options but sadly none of the settings did not seem change the overall darkness of the shadow .
i 've been wanting to find a good animated web series to watch besides rwby .
if anyone would like to exchange friend codes for the safari add me .
also if anyone would be kind enough to tell me what i have in mine it would be much appreciated thanks .
i 've put in a ticket with support but it being saturday and de 's support being m-f just need to vent a little and see if anyone has any ideas on the likelihood of my account being unbanned .
today i was playing as i normally do grinding up some ranks on my new rhino prime and jat kittag awesome weapon and did a little bit of trading .
i bought 2 mods today from 2 different users .
i have never used a cheat program alongside warframe i 've only bought plat from steam .
i do have cheat engine installed for use on sp games but i 've not even ran the exe of it since september at which time i 'd not been playing warframe at all .
to the best of my knowledge i 've not been running any other programs that could 've caused their detection system to go off .
i do wonder if my account was compromised as i have not set up two-step verification .
basically just ranting a bit and freaking out a touch .
anyone who has been banned by a false detection feel free to let me know how your support ticket went and what i can expect .
the game is pretty dead since wolay do n't update the game but it still fun to play .
come play on zircon servers it 's really fun !
and for the briefest moment i had a panicked series of thoughts one right after the other
the waiter had gotten out drink order mixed up with another table .
yeah because an unsweetened iced tea looks exactly like a margarita .
interesting article but i do n't think this subreddit is the right place for it .
god not this fucking corey is a transexual '' cancerous scum
it looked to me like he just screwed up a laser .
so actually it should be even less possible to connect criminality with religion since it ca n't even be geographically placed .
without his goals last season they would have gone down
obie returned home early this morning thank you so much for offering to look for him !
my husband and i spend every single night together eat dinner and breakfast together and only do work related things apart we also regularly use each other 's phones and share an office at home .
if he were cheating it would n't be an anonymous message that would tip me off .
if i got such a message i would immediately dismiss it as a troll show it to him and we would both laugh about it .
my plan was to wait until verde comes up but i pulled him yesterday .
so for ovarall progress i 'm still lacking an immunity buffer but on the other hand i want a speed dragons team galleon .
yeah i agree about creating an effective representarive democracy .
i guess im trying to point out the although effective it was constructed with little input from the people who form the democracy .
our founding fathers were flawed like all men and held different idealogies and view points .
it 's inspiring that they were able to create a social democracy especially because it was a relatively new idea of the time .
im just poking a few holes through the inconsistency of their ideals and the way they governed .
such as everyone having inalienable rights but owning slaves .
they set the path to abolishment but were themselves guilty of some things that they condemned .
the system they creates benefited pretty much everyone in the nation but especially themselves .
a bit unrelated but also got ta say john marshall was a baws .
i 'm also lvl 24 and mobs are just melting for me .
what i do is i rush in lmb until i have full focus then i use my blindside q to enter draw stance and just rmb the mobs down and try to finish them with flash step to recover my focus .
usually mobs die before i run out of focus .
of course it probably helps that i 've upgraded my weapon to stage 5 of the second form but it 's still a lot of damage just from those skills .
i 'd suggest going to the viridian valor stone vendor in jadestone village and buying the viridian valor soul shield set there gives loads of hp and defenses .
edit also i 'm just specced into the focus recovery stuff on rush and raid lifesteal on breeze first point in honed slash and the life regen talent on block .
the life recovery stuff is just for sustain in case i pull too much and get low on life .
your call i 'm okay in trails but kinda handicapped with this character .
i kinda want to get the lead belly perk for immersion sake because i doubt my character would eat mole rat stew or whatever and he 'd rather eat some suger bombs to remind him of pre war life hell i 'd fucking do it .

assume the sensible rational argument is the one people will believe .
you want to get people to believe something else you need more than just that .
it takes a lot of evidence to prove what you allege .
its a possiblity but no more than that as far as we can see .
do n't get tinfoil ... or do n't reveal your power level without evidence to damn them all to hell .
haahahaah you need profit that badly ahahahahahahah nice try homie but this comment made me laugh xd
kanada sucht sich in den fl√ºchtlingscamps die fl√ºchtlinge aus die es aufnehmen m√∂chte die durchlaufen ebenso einen selektionsprozess und sicherheits√ºberpr√ºfungen .
es sind auch nicht nur ein paar 1000 sondern 50000 .
die zahl wird sich auch noch erh√∂hen denn kanada ist auf einwanderung angewiesen .
und der unterschied in der willkommenskultur liegt eher darin dass unsere illegalen das als l√§stige pflicht sehen w√§hrend handselektierte kanadische einwanderer wissen dass sie dem aufnahmeland was schuldig sind .
yeah and a gender equal society would be broke as fuck too because obviously we 've evolved for men to be dominant over women .
i am 44 watch my team mostly be a joke early on in life ... 85-2001 .
i honestly did not think this team would ever win ...
hbo had a show 1st and 10 '' and the rolling joke was .

i think my experience as a fan is far more fulfilling than some kid that has only known winning .

he is doing you guys a disservice at this point .
btw i have a question i 'm lvl 25 valk but i lvl up flash sword by mistake ?
ahh and when i sold my items to trading house i got half the price ? ? ? ?
1 more question should i keep changing weps or just keep 1 and lvl it up ?
we used to do this all the time as well .
i 'm pretty sure after a couple years the staff caught onto the fact we were doing this but since we went to the snack bars they did n't say anything .
i was hoping it would sound like polish but it does not .
i 'm pleasantly surprised no one 's complaining about the use of the term zero gravity '' .
sure it 's a thing it 's not that bikes are only a hobby .
some people do n't have other means of transport .
snow is n't actually that bad of a surface to ride on it 's like mud and people ride dirtroads all the time .
so it 's not really a problem as long as you have some nobby tires .
ice however well that 's another category ice is evil especially black ice https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=efiw2k8gasm .
the article 's tone reminds me of a communist '' friend except he uses money and as such i typically refer to him a socialist whom agrees with marx 's money principals those being that because with money it is possible for some people to extract profit as middlemen such as with banking services and wall st services via market fluctuations ... it makes sense not to use money ... yet use of money spontaneously comes into existence repeatedly in human history despite service fees because i believe it is wholly beneficial due to the drastic increase in potential trade .
coming from the corporate world my assumption is that purely economically wall st and banks ought to have functional net profit approaching zero as they are infinitely competitive industries modifiers/multiples and barriers to entry such as min fed apr licensing and sec rules aside .
my retort to my marxist friend is that if he ever is hungry and regarding his principal refusal of usd i 'll happily mail him a box of potatoes ... and if a box of potatoes is not convenient or he matures i 'll suffer whatever taxes and fractional bank fees in order to send him a currency other than potatoes ... haha
regarding his point and mmt specifically please correct me if you believe the following is wrong
the governments ' or any entities ' abilities to change the value of it 's currency considering currencies purely as trade mechanisms lies within the laws yes the laws set dictating the degree to which that entity can induce relative change in the currency though i also disagree with the article statement like you that these laws are not explicitly the definition of capitalism they perhaps can be considered existing as result of the degree of state currency insurances and/or degree of socialism via taxes ... a good example of this is min fed apr and though quite positively the government 's economic policy is in the best interest of the land and equity owners of entities residing within the government resulting in policies intending the stabilization of extreme growth or recession .
however if the government gets crazy with it 's policies regarding it 's dollar people will suffer the fees in transacting in a competing currency or ultimately move their business to another country .
thus the power of the entity to manipulate currency via borrowing internationally from citizens taxes tariffs lending rates etc .
can be represented simply as it 's delta in safety language geography etc .
in this way mmt is simply functional reality of currency competition and certainly the power of value change is not infinite .

we 're supposed to just call the police except recently i heard that their telling us that we 're allowed to go as far as following them outside and taking a picture of their license plate if we 've already alerted someone else to call the police .
yes it is called global position '' right now however the mapsharing feature seems to be broken .
because you win the first toss and then under protest of the losers of the toss its tossed again without talking about it with anyone and you then lose ?
you do understand that all i said was that 2 billion dollars is not enough to set up a production chain on par with that of established hardware giants and especially so within the limited timeframe do you ?
i 'm not sure why you 're getting so upset over someone pointing such a fact out that you feel inclined to insult them .
haha nope it 's been a lot of fun to see you and simon compete .
i find it so cool that people take them time to master any of my levels like that and it 's an honor to have that kind of talent competing in there .
he has set the bar ridiculously high with his 21.894 second run .
and at least the game has been smart enough to keep the difficulty showing as medium .
the clear rate is now 11 but at one point it was 8 which is pretty crazy for this kind of level lol .
yeah but i do n't agree with your comment with would n't wait so i wanted to make it blatant .
someone that wants a 390 or 970 would appreciate these cards more then anyone if they are truly latest cores .

you eat only as much as your body needs nothing excess .
yes your gains might suffer a bit but is that more important than ending this habit ?
in fact with all the excess calories you gain you loose much more after pmoing .
so if you control your diet nafs and pmo you 'll actually gain more/feel and look healthy .

i think what op is saying is that he was approaching a green light noticed a cop waiting to turn to go in the same direction .
he slowed down to allow the cop to go first .
idk if it 's overtly illegal enough for a moving violation but it is a very strange thing to do .
a car slowing down at a green light especially in the presence of a cop could indicate an impaired driver .

why are you sucking up to us and the warriors ?
i definitely saw a lack of confidence going into the turn .
so i guess that combined with the physical factors may have contributed .
to me that means you were thinking too hard about your current move .
one thing i 've learned is that if you 're thinking about what you 're doing right now you 're doing something wrong .
need to always think ahead and let your instincts handle the present .

you 'll be fine that sounds perfect for the type of interview you 're going to .
if your skin in general is getting better but your break out zone has gotten significantly worse then i do n't think it 's a product sensitivity issue or what some people are saying that your benton stuff has spoiled people like to say this a lot as if it 's the only possible explanation .
otherwise it would n't be just your forehead which is already your usual breakout zone .
depending on how often you 're using the stridex it could be that .
i would n't recommend a ph adjusting toner as you 're not using one at the moment and the stridex is already being effective and potent perhaps too effective lol as it is if your breakouts are coming out more .
ph adjusting toners lowers your skin ph to a more optimal level for the acids so they can be more effective .
it can still be purging but that depends on how long you 've been experiencing it .
if this has been happening for a few months i 'd probably lower the usage on the stridex especially if it 's daily and see how things are .
but if this is just your first month of using stridex then i 'm inclined to think it 's purging .
also sometimes using vit c which is pretty potent along with an aha and then a tea tree essence as well causes skin to be too drying and thus itchy .
so if this has been going on for a while i 'd probably fiddle with the number of times i use in a week for those or maybe separate them in application like vit c one day stridex the next .
ca n't believe we even had to challenge this in the first place ...
i think we 're still friends on your other fc from when i was active like a year ago ...

the animation to bring the weapon up only takes time away from firing .

i 've only been on one cruise and it 's gon na stay that way .
i 'm prone to really bad motion sickness so i was taking anti-motion sickness medication made sure the room was on the lowest floor of the ship and closest to the middle and i brought along every non-medical preventative measure i could find on cruise boards such as green apples dry crackers ginger gum etc .
i was even taking the medication ahead of time so that it would be in my system .
first day on the boat i take a pill around 7 am board the ship around noon and everything 's fine and dandy for the few hours before we set sail .
it 's october and the waters are really rough so around 5 pm i start reaaaaaaaaalllyy feeling the motion of the boat and pretty much run down to my room to lay down .
i realized my pills were n't going to get me through the cruise so my sister goes to the infirmary with the hope that their pills work better .
you 're supposed to take them every 12 hours .
i was around hour 11 by this point so i take the new pills ... and regret it almost immediately .
not only was i dizzy and nauseated beyond belief now thanks to the pills i felt like i was legitimately going to die .
i was lapsing in and out of consciousness for about 5 hours .
during that time i would cycle between shivering so badly my entire body was violently shaking to about 2 minutes later not exaggerating i would be drenched in so much sweat it felt like someone had poured water on me repeat .
my heart was racing and my limbs kept going completely numb ... like not asleep .
i mean they honestly felt dead as if they were n't there anymore .
i felt pretty rotten for most of the next day but the following 2 days were shockingly fine .
still though it was terrifying and i never want to experience anything like that again .
err lem me see if my y even has one .
lem me finish this trade and i 'll check should be only 3-4 mins .
ok im not really complaining about the trailers since they do n't seem to ruin the movie and show off what it is .
im complaining about the posters that look fucking stupid .
they have ones of shots of his ass ones of his junk one thats all emojis and ironically one where they advertise it as a romantic comedy
people who do n't know deadpool do n't know what the hell this is .
alot of people are turned off because it just looks like a dumb movie .

even if ncsoft releases it 3 times as fast that 's still a year 's worth before we catch up .
what they are good for is releasing the game in english so many more people can play and with decent ping .
honestly i feel you 're just finding things to complain about .
if this was n't an mmo and a stand-alone single player game would you complain about the lack of content ?
rejection sucks especially if it 's from people who are close to you .
but if they 're only accepting part of you and are n't willing to accept the rest that says more about them then it does about you .
you 're not my patient so i ca n't really speak on your gender dysphoria diagnosis .
if you felt eager at one point it at least means that there 's something you 're compelled to explore and that you 're looking to become whole .
there 's a lot of people who worry about that .
they worry about if they 'll be able to have sex if they go on hormone therapy .
they worry if they 'll be able to have sex if they have bottom surgery .
they worry if they 'll still be able to achieve orgasm .
all of those things are legitimate thoughts so do n't feel like you have to downplay them .
fetishization of something usually revolves around sexual objectification of a thing .
so if your only pull towards this is sexual gratification it 's possible .
but it does n't sound like that 's the case .
for me being non-gender identified non-binary genderqueer or whatever you want to call it ... it is n't a problem .

you should always strive to help people in need but with that said denmark is a small country with an already high cost to just support the current inhabitants so i do not see it as a plausible solution that we take in as many refugees as we can .
once they are actually in denmark or any other northern european country they would of course have to conform to the rules laws and norms of said country and if they are incapable of doing so repetitive offenders etc .

i can see that you have a couple figures that could be from sets from the adventurers theme the egypt subtheme specifically based on johnny thunder and slyboots .
i also see director cameraman and stuntman figures which are from the studios '' theme .
the green arctic '' guy is probably from 6626 6577 or another arctic '' set .
the guys with the red masks are islanders from the islanders '' subtheme .
they were part of the 90s pirates '' theme .
the ones you have could be from 6262 although that 's just a guess .
some of your pirates could be from those sets too .
brickpedia is a great place to look at some of themes and figure out exactly what sets you have .

if we set this precedent of no offtopic content say goodbye to historical pics discussion and videos because they are not wows content .
this is not your sub and it is not against the rules to post off topic things in the comments .
stop being passive aggressive and simply do n't click on it if you do n't like it .
you do n't step in a pile of shit on purpose then start to complain that your foot has shit on it and it smells .
another off topic video that is not wows content but i bet you 're not going to go yell at that guy are you ?
you should have shouted something more appropriate like aaaawwww butts ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ''

i said that that would increase the chance of a type-1 error without proper correction .
i should have indicated instead of the expected number of type-1 errors the probability of any type-1 error 1 0.95^n where n is the number of tests performed .

i 'm sorry for the long delay i was pretty sure i 'd be done by now .
i assume you want to make a music pack not a sound pack ?
if you want to make a full sound pack first off ew .
third good luck since if you have trouble with pm itself then you 're going to have a lot of trouble with this .
you can convert any song from mp3 or wav format to brstm the brawl music format using some programs .
if you want to ask others for help with that part you can go to r/brstm or smashboards both of which let you request brstms and others will help you make them .
the smashboards thread is called the giant brstm thread or something its under custom content in the pm forums .
you can also grab things off of brawlcustommusic.com or ask other people to send you their music packs and cannibalize the parts you want .
as for actually turning those files into a music pack there 's a lovely program called brawl song manager which you can find here http www.lakora.us/brawl/songmanager
i think its pretty self-explanatory but just in case i 'll try and explain what you do with it .
i strongly recommend you make a copy of your pm stuff and do all of this on your computer not directly on the sd card .
now you can go through and select any song in the game on the left .
its name should appear on the top right which you can edit .
now drag whatever brstm file you want to use into the box on the right and it should fill with data .
also the name of the song slot on the left should now have an asterisk next to it to indicate there 's a custom song there .
when you 're done go to tools update menumain and when you exit tell it to save .
now deleted everything from your sd card and copy your build wholesale over to your sd card .

he did n't call fair catch and blocked the player from catching/downing the ball in order to gain field advantage .
absolutely but this is pro football not backyard football .
the other guy should have situational awareness enough to know that getting slammed is an option .
in my opinion that 's what makes pro athletes what they are .
making a split second decision on whether to guard or catch and knowing when it is appropriate in that second .
depends on your definition of egregious there were certainly calls that were missed but watching it live as a warriors fan it was more of a wow how do you not call that '' while the warriors went for a are you fucking serious wtf is wrong with you blind ass ref bitch ''

since people are probably going to ask ... you can buy it over the counter in the u.s. at walgreens walmart cvs etc .
just go to the pharmacy and ask for it .
one human study used novolin r so that 's probably a good one to start with .
you can put it in a nasal spray bottle or just use a needless syringe lean your head back put some in your nose and sniff .
there has actually been a fair amount of human testing .
also it seems to have very little effect if any on blood insulin levels .
most of the research shows zero effect on blood levels in humans .
it absorbs into the cerebrospinal fluid and then interacts with the massive numbers of insulin receptors spread throughout the brain .
it does have peripheral effects as well it improves peripheral insulin resistance through the hypothalamus .
i 'll echo the others and say to swap the 32gb ram for 16gb and up the gfx card to a 970 .
there may be the grumblings about the last 500mb of vram but a faster card is a faster card .
well in his last three fight hendricks kept trying to take him down and succeeded at times rory got stuffed on his attempts and condit really does n't do that much .
he has fought plenty of guys during his most recent run who have/tried to take him down but to lawler 's credit his takedown defense has gotten really good and he 's able to keep the fight more where he wants it rather than his opponents just throwing their plans out the window .
ah thats too bad but i think not enough to turn me off from the purchase .
have audio technica ath-m50 's now and the foam padding has gotten a lot worse over the time ive owned it and the ears rubbing on the driver gets annoying but wouldnt be a change for me
i posted in the first match thread about how i want kohli 's wrists to do dirty things to me i stand by that comment .
i wear wife beaters under my regular dress shirts for work .
just because not wearing an undershirt under a dress shirt seems weird .
but before i was professional and shit i had a lot of white trailer trash friends due to our similar socioeconomic status and most of them frequently wore wife beaters without a dress shirt overtop .
it was sort of a cultural or proud to be this status '' thingy .
blue jeans or dickies pants are sort of in there as well .
it 's sort of like proudly saying this is who i am .
white trash and proud or just i do n't give a fuck enough to put on more than my undershirt when i walk out the house actually trailer is more likely .

i 've been actually considering adopting a shepard my room mate 's corgi needs a playmate and we 've got the space for one .
i 've actually got accommodations for a larger dog in storage as well .
so if you are unable to locate the owner i can offer a loving rehome .
this has been national news for about two days now it 's a little too early to say that the governor knowingly poisoned people ... unless there 's some legit source out there i have n't seen this article certainly is n't it .
it 's been like that for a while now .
they were n't allowed to cuss when i went through almost 6 years ago .
hard to say but with that many saves there is a decent chance he was playing perm goalie which would explain why the other team got so many shots on goal because there was no rotation .
obviously i do n't know but he does also not have 1 shot on goal of his own .
vanessa could be carrie fisher 's daughter and she 's not playing leia ?

there 's a kendrick reference track where kendrick just kinda plays with flows and words and kanye uses some of them .

really a hud should be simple to just have a scaling option for that would be nice .

the ability to customize the appearance of the overlay would be invaluable .

coming from a die hard hawks fan crosby is the clear cut no doubt face of the nhl .
to be fair indians love to stare even at their own people .
i have been living in japan for the past two years and when i made my trip back to delhi i was shocked to see how much oggling goes on day to day .
the idiots would stare at anything that looks out of place .
naoki urasawa 's manga often involve a death of a mc and the story continuing to unfold from another charater 's perspective .
makes me wonder why the fuck adams was playng in front of him for so fucking long .
when it showed up my mom thought i ordered a microwave oven ahaha !
anyways i just posted a thread of my build in this case !
man this fooled a lot of kids back in the day .
i never fell for it but i also had no idea how trimmed armour was found .
i do n't think this would ever work now since i would say most old school players have been playing rs1/rs2 for years
i 'm fairly certain it 's the case fan .
when i ordered the pc build i specifically stated i wanted a proper fan for cooling as my last pc lived a rather short five year life and died on me due to heat sink issues .
so when i bought the new one i was somewhat paranoid and ordered the extra cooling .
at this point the damn thing is turning on for 10 seconds stopping for 10 seconds and repeating that over and over .
it 's going from being annoying to making me want to tear the fan out .
also i would rather have the layout of the original wii classic controller but i 'm not a fan having the cord coming out of the top .
until they explained it was raptors in a scene that they deleted for god knows why in jurassic park lost world when the boat gets to the dock ... the crew on it were killed/eaten so anyone who paid attention would surely wonder what killed the crew because it sure as hell was n't the t-rex that was trapped inside the boat
this just like some well off brats like to steal stuff for the thrill '' there are some psycho 's that are there play cop and robbers for the thrill too .
i know a couple of guys who did a minimum wage shift for a grocery store and some punk walked and tried to walk out with stuff expecting them to not get in a fight over a couple dollars of stuff .
well what he did n't expect was that these were the kind of guys that would use any excuse to get in a fight and they used that excuse to get the full advantage of his ass .
they stayed at that place not for the wages but the chance to beat up more snot nosed shoplifters .
thank you guys i shaved it will give it a chance later in life .
it was difficult decision because i want to hear does it look ok or it will be ok because of job and profession right now it seems that it 's not ok
i would suggest a close up render also or like set the camera up just above the ...
string tightening knobs lol and then aim it toward the base .
or even put the camera super close between 2 strings you could get a pretty sweet macro effect with some depth of field .
i would suggest a obsdian cello next if you need ideas
what method did you use to make the installer stick ?
i think they 're very similar except the bottom image seems to be a mish-mash of an elephant combined with the original clover monster or the dilophosaurus from jurassic park .
but the other emotions would have ruined the core memories .
when sadness touched the first one it was 'infected ' and ruined it anyways .

looks like tomorrow we will be sitting all of my day off on the toilet potty since the boy seems to think it is okay to take his diaper off .
he has done it twice today with each poop .
i am excited to finally see deadpool hit the big screen however none of the trailers make the movie seem all that funny especially deadpool himself .
he comes off as more annoying/omg i 'm so random/daniel way garbage .
some will say deadpool is supposed to be annoying and it 's just a tactic he uses during battle to distract his enemies but they totally could 've made it funny .
i will admit tj miller 's lines from the trailers have been great .
as an aside tj is definitely not who i would have pictured as weasel
we 're a couple looking for new friends to join us on our camping and hiking adventures around victoria .
we are based in the melbourne metro area and set off on our adventures from here .
we 've been camping every weekend for the past 4 months and we 're looking for interesting people to join us in our adventures .
originally i had thought about creating a meetup group in order to recruit a few people but that seemed like overkill and i did n't want to spend too much time administering the group .
we do have a few requirements for people who want to join us
able to source your own equipment as we do n't have any spares .
a 4wd is nice but not necessary as most of our camping trips are to 2wd accessible locations
comfortable or willing to rough it out in the bush most locations do not have facilities like toilets or showers .
do n't mind days where we will literally sit around and watch the time pass by hours on end .
if this sounds like fun to you drop me a line or reply to this post and i 'll contact you when i can !

i built a parallel box that worked great single 3034 mosfet pptc fuses .
problem was it sometimes would either refuse to cease firing unless i unsnapped lid .
rebuilt and it was wonky would only fire for a second or two .
so i pulled box completely down and started from scratch .
went with dual 3034 's and the requisite fuses and all now it 's acting like the fuses are tripping .
i 've been back through it checked resistance on atty .26 ohms on a 3.8 v batteries .
i ca n't see any pinches or exposed wiring or anything that could possibly be shorting out .
tomorrow after work i will replace the pptc fuses again and see but any direction or course of action that i should try beforehand will be accepted .

platform s ps2 may also have been ps1 but i 'm pretty sure it was ps2
i remember you could kind of see where the displacement lines were on the ground so you could see the triangles .
you could choose any place to go you wanted .
i remember one place had a load of bats that were absolutely deadly .
game was perma-death no saving no passwords this may have been due to the fact it was a demo .
it had a home world of sorts except you just walked out with no loading times .
there were villagers that you could buy things from like a sword .
other details this game appeared on a demo disk .
unfortunately i 'm not sure which because i had about 4 that came with my system .
it shared a disc with one or more of the following .
this game went on for 5 minutes before it ended .
this was a platformer chaser you just had to go down and the screen catches you death .
there was a purple man and a green man .
this was basically worms 3d but not nearly as good .
seemed to run at about 10 frames on the demo .
recently released on ps4 so you should know this one .
game may have been called the adventure game but this returns no results due to adventure and game being such common words .
unfortunately i 've not got a lot to go on since i was about 6 when i got this and it was a demo but i hope somewhere out there is a 'demo expert ' because i 'd love to play the full release .
solved someone i know hooked me up with info when i told him i 'd posted it on reddit .
apparently sony released a dev kit anyone could buy called the net yaroze .
the official playstation magazine then held some kind of contest which ended up with loads of these ny games on demo disks .
these games were indeed for the ps1 i was wrong .
interestingly the guy who made it went on to work for sony .
i 've no idea how i managed to get one of these disks though .
has this ever been done with the new smash 4 ?
it would be completely chaotic and entertaining to watch .
either 8 pro players playing smash or maybe 4 2 player teams ?

i 've been trying to solve this problem but could n't understand it and checked the calculator i 'm supposed to solve this without calculator where it shows the answer is 6 .
i have simplified 3 ‚àö52 to 2 3 ‚àö2^2 and i 've also tried converting to exponential form but could n't get to 6 .
note 2 3 ‚àö2^2 is 2 times the cube root of 2^2 not 2 cubed times sqrt of 2^2 .
all the other superscripted 3s are meant to show cube root sorry for the confusion

i downloaded the update and let it reboot to install it but then it loads into twrp and idk what to do from that point .
i read that i would need to re-root my phone but i used wug 's root toolkit so probably need some help re-using that since it 's been a while .

curious as to how you would go about trying to convince your friends to try and play more 7 wonders .
i did a quick play with some friends and most of them felt that it was a solo game while looking and seeing what your neighbors are doing '' which i feel is n't really giving the game a chance .
how would you go about trying to explain the game in a more interesting '' manner ?
help me sell the game as in convince my friends to try it again .
one of the strongest pillars of my faith hinges on the fact that i 've never heard anyone come close to presenting an answer to this question that was intellectually satisfying to me but that does n't mean such an answer does n't exist .

i just bought a 3rd monitor and was hoping to have an eyefinity setup .
i do n't care about playing on the highest settings i just want it to be able to run smoothly .
i was thinking of an r9 380 but that might not be enough .
what is the cheapest card i could get to be able to game with eyefinity smoothly ?
3 x 1080p and my cpu is an i5-3570k .

i 'm just annoyed that it would have been so cool to have a screenshot of me getting 56455 in one hit but no c is it reasonable to say i got a 56k hit ?

im sure there are websites out there any suggestions ?
i now have at least 38000000 experience points in the constitution skill .
how does the game change the cost for vehicles in rb ground ?
the story below is one example of me being screwed by the game .
i spawned in my easy 8 sherman m4a3 76 w hvss for 240 spawn points and scored a kill on a tiger and nearly finished off a t-34-85 before an is-2 insta-gibbed me from the side .
so i quickly spawned back in seeing as there were at least 5 people trying to capture our base in domination on normandy .
i bring in my f6f with tiny tim rockets 298mm rockets and score a kill on a pz iv/70 and severely damage an su-152 then come back and strafe and kill a bm-8-24 t-70 rocket tank .
as i 'm pulling away an ostwind opens up on me and kills me from about 1.5 km out .
sad i bail out and ca n't wait to respawn .
but to my horror i only have 545 spawn points and need 600 to bring in my m4a3e2 75 or my m6a1 .
so i ask now how does the rb spawn point system work ?
i find it ridiculous that an undertiered tank 5.0 br in a 6.0 game cost so many spawn points ?
let 's be real here an m4a3e2 in a 6.0 game will scratch the paint on just about everything and just annoy them until they turn around and put one through the front armor plate from 800m out .
if drug pricing comes up at tonights presidential debate another huge wave of selling will ensue .

so i noticed earlier today that airlocks appear to be more realistic now with jets of air flooding in only when pressurizing and air moisture condensing into a thin mist when evacuated .
this is pure awesome because when i went to complain about it looking the same in both cases there was already a thread on the issue tracker with like 17 responses .
be as specific as possible and include specific games or programs you will be using .
i 've been using my ps3 with the ps3 media server for many years now but i just want a box that can store my media and output to my onkyo reciever .
it takes hdmi audio and optical audio so my new pc needs to have those two outputs .
i plan on running openelec on it to play media .
i 'd like a case with at least 5 hot swap bays so i do n't have to mess with cables when i want to expand storage .
400 is the max but i 'd like to stay around 300 .
that price does n't include storage as i will be expanding that later .
note beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy .
what exactly do you need included in the budget ?
which country and state/province will you be purchasing the parts in ?
if you 're in us do you have access to a microcenter location ?
if reusing any parts including monitor s keyboard/mouse/etc what parts will you be reusing ?
if yes are you interested in overclocking right away or down the line ?
are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build ?
ex ssd large amount of storage or a raid setup cuda or opencl support etc
do you have any specific case preferences size like itx/microatx/mid-tower/full-tower styles colors window or not led lighting etc or a particular color theme preference for the components ?
do you need a copy of windows included in the budget ?
if you do need one included do you have a preference ?
seriously i would buy multiple 120ml bottles of this if someone got the flavor spot on .
i asked my friends and i looked around the internet .

i now have at least 24000000 experience points in the dungeoneering skill .
long story short my girlfriend got enough money to buy a pc around 900 bucks .
she wants something that will last a while without having to update .
i do n't need an os keyboard monitor mouse or anything like that .
we 'd of course like to go cheaper on the pc but even a little above 900 is fine for a good rig .
she uses it to play mmo 's mostly but wants to play some newer games witcher 3 bioshock infinite and more .
she has also toyed with the idea of streaming .
i 'm asking on here because i have n't built a pc in years and really fell out of the loop .
i want to make sure everything here looks good before i consider suggesting it to her .
i may have the opportunity to get a better processor for cheaper or the same price through family so i was wondering if i could fit a better i5 or an i7 in without it bottlenecking the build

i remember having google earth on my desktop by 2006 which means that the satellite data was likely from 2005 .
i 'm just wondering if anyone has asked google about any satellite data they may have of the manitowoc area at the time of the murder .
this may sound silly but what if a passing satellite caught someone who otherwise thought they were completely alone ?
i realize the chances are small but i 've been thinking about this for a couple of weeks and felt the need to post .
update i found a post that answered my question before i even asked it .

outbreaks of snow sleet and rain will linger across much of scotland through the day with the north largely dry with sunny spells .
rain over the southwest and wales turning lighter later .
any lingering rain or snow will mostly fizzle out overnight with cloudy skies away from the southeast where skies will be clearer .
i have a question regarding invisibility spells on the astral plane especially regarding astral security .
i used to assume that invisibility spells are useless against astrally perceiving characters because i thought that the spell itself is always visible on the astral plane .
an astrally perceiving character might not see the invisible target itself but always that there is a spell at the current location of the invisible target .
so countermeasures could be arranged alarms grenades full-auto fire in the general direction etc .
however one might argue that at least the mana version of the invisibility spell will cause an astrally perceiving character to just ignore the spell in the same way he or she ignores the physical body when normally perceiving .
however with a sustaining spell there is always a visible connection in the astral plane from spellcaster to target so is the entire connection ignored or just the last part to the target ?
is the spell visible if the astrally perceiving character can see the spellcaster but not the target ?

so when i was about 9 or 10 years old while playing gold version i encountered a random pokemon while searching in the grass that i had never seen before .
the way my younger self always described it was that it had ribbon looking things surrounding it and that it was mostly white and grey .
it immediately ran away from me before i could catch it .
this was before i knew about the legendary dogs .
so throughout the years up until tonight when i told people about my encounter they would always say that it might 've been a suicune but i did n't think that was right because the suicune i always encountered in gold and silver were blue not white and grey .
i was thinking the same thing tonight and i came across this thought ... what if it was a suicune..but shiny ? ? ? ! !
so i did a quick google search and discovered that shiny suicune 's sprite in the original gold and silver is indeed white and grey and that i encountered the first and only shiny wild legendary pokemon i 'd ever find in my entire pokemon life as a 9/10 year old .
and thus a 15 year old mystery has been solved i 'm 25 now .
alright to get to the point basically i plan to set up a 75g planted tropical community tank .
as far as livestock goes this is what i 'm at .
all advice and suggestions appreciated and will be taken into consideration so thanks

this morning was the first time i saw this story so thought i 'd share it here .
the ft version is better in my opinion but behind a paywall so free article also linked .
the quick summary is that the higher rate tax relief on pension contributions is at risk of being abolished to a flat rate in the upcoming budget .
it has n't been announced yet but this sounds like it has been leaked out of the treasury department so no smoke without fire ... '' etc .
however the relief for basic rate tax payers would move up so do n't read too much into the downwards '' in the title sorry !
the ft article also suggests that salary sacrifice would be prohibited as well as it would be a simple loophole around this .
but not only you assholes brigading my post on another subreddit but then you insulted a lot of artists or bands i do like and then proceeded to insult me personally .

a decent build for 60 points or could i do better ?
it was a warm summer day in the heart of red square .
sasha our heroine for this little adventure was sitting on a park bench next to her boyfriend at the time niko .
he was for lack of a better term far too involved with his phone to care for sasha .
sasha asked a bright kind smile on her face .
he replied looking up from his handheld telecommunications device .
sasha understandably was a little dumbfounded by the statement .
you wan na get a bite to eat first ?
and stop doing that i will beat your fucking face in if you do that . ''
you know you are a bit of an asshole ni '' she said before getting backhanded by her him .
once they got to a local eatery sasha told niko about how she was shipping out in a couple of days .
so it 's official i 'm shipping out in a few days . ''
she said with an ecstatic glee which fell on deaf ears as niko was hitting up the waitress .
she asked niko replying with a scoff of his own .
mom was right i should n't have gone out with you . ''
in a split second sasha was yanked forward by the sleeves of her jacket niko showing a fire in his eyes unlike any other .
why do you even listen to your whore cow of a mother ?
now sasha felt insulted crossing her arms as she sat back down .
great tits fine ass and she 's a native russian unlike your half-blood bullshit . ''
at this point sasha did n't really give half a fuck .
she asked just sitting back and waiting for hers and his food .
oh and she 's way better in the sack then you . ''
do you really need to talk about this in public ? ''
after eating niko got up and left first leaving sasha to pay .
once she did the russian-american/canadian found herself pinned against the wall by niko .
you did n't use the credit card did you ?
you spend my money again i swear to god i will beat you fucking senseless ! ''
i had like 50 euros i paid in cash ! ''
oh you are so going to pay for this ! ''
lt. karnov sasha 's co said announcing that the first supply drop for sidewinder had arrived .
she had n't ordered anything since it was the first drop but she did collect a few letters from niko and ... his mother ?
that 's weird i do n't recall niko 's mom . ''
when she opened the letter she was completely devastated .
after reading it and seeing the photos attached she ... changed ... she was no longer a fun-loving redhead she was ...
way to go niko ... you just done fucked up ... '' she said to herself as she lit the letter ablaze tossing it into the snow .
when i get back to earth ... you 're gon na have a baaaad time ... ''
do you use all the swords of x in your 360 cube ?
if you have another cube what do you think you would include ?
i 'm kind of partial to excluding either sword of mind and body the mill is extremely punishing in limited less so than jace destroyer of cubes but still an extremely quick finisher especially if you 're piloting a gx deck or sword of light and shadow just not very sexy compared to the rest both protection and effect-wise .
edit feel free to suggest changes for sword of feast and famine and ice and fire from the perspective of my cube specifically !
i bought a amazon fire tv and loaded up kodi installed the aeon nox silvo skin and everything worked great .
so about a week ago i get the low storage '' alert finding out that kodi was using up most of the drive .
no problem i thought i 'll bung a microsd card in and move all the artwork there .
however the firetv is not quite as straightforward as a conventional windows htpc i had previously built .
using esfile explorer with just a keyboard is a nightmare and i 'm not entirely sure where i should put the advancedsettings.xml file on the system .
is there a tool/addon for kodi which can simple go move all artwork/fanart/thumbnaiuls '' to sdcard/location '' and tell kodi or automatically create advancedsettings.xml info this is where all artwork is located .
if not whats the best way to do this .
i 'd like to keep artwork on the microsd card not just pull it from the network what with the delay when a hdd spins up .
would it be worth creating the advancedsettings.xml in advance and then copying it over to the correct directory ?
also on the firetv what is the best way to direct to the sdcard ie sdcard ?
d ? not familiar with this type of naming scheme
edit confirmed my water did break told ya so hospital !
have been admitted on an iv because i was supposed to get my gbs done at the doc tomorrow .
could be a couple days but ... .. we are not leaving here without a baby people !
so i woke up around 5 o'clock this morning to a gush of fluid got up and went to the toilet lost more fluid pretty much totally clear then i peed .
so i 'm sure that what was leaking out of me before was n't pee and it was n't coming out of there anyway .
when i went to get off the toilet i lost some more fluid went to my bedroom changed my underwear called my midwives answering service almost immediately soaked through that pair of underwear realized that of course i do n't have pads because i 'm a jackass and i only walked by them every day in the store but i thought i had plenty of time ... . woke up my husband and waited for the call back .
midwife says it 's probably not my water and that baby changing position can cause urine leaks .
i try to explain that it was n't urine it looked and smelled different there was a lot of it i 've soaked through my underwear twice etc .
tells me no need to come in but do n't send your husband to work '' like lady my husband runs the shop 40 miles from home he works 7-6 every day i do n't have the luxury of choosing whether he goes to work or not .
she tells me if i 'm not soaking my underwear or a pad did you not hear me say i 've soaked my underwear twice ?
finally she agrees to have me go get checked out and tells me the cramping is normal if your water broke '' .
i 'm also sure i saw some of my mucus plug .
i know neither of these things means i 'm having a baby today but can you at least tell me why i feel like someone turned the faucet on ?
the hospital is 30 miles away we had 35 miles in our tank we had to stop for gas and my husband got a french toast sandwich while we were there it 's snowing and sleeting and i 'm cramping and still losing fluid into a washcloth i tucked in my underwear byeee dignity !
i 'm laughing at all this absurdity but i 'm actually very anxious so wish me luck ... .
i went to bed and i woke up at 6 in the morning to the computer giving the beep codes that it plays when something fails .
it was a dell computer playing 4 regular beeps which i think means ram failure ?
edit i am pretty sure that this is a ram read/write failure .
i looked up the beep codes at this website .
edit so i got it to work by reinstalling all of my ram sticks but does anyone knwo what causes read/write failures ?
i am reading about all this support for classic yet i do not see any of it .

the 1st monday of february we 're hosting our 7th night for magic the gathering .
as per my earlier thread https www.reddit.com/r/basementboardgames/comments/3f5acg/monday_night_magic_interest_check this is a casual event friends having a few beers and a chat who happen to be playing mtg .
even if you 've never played before and you 're just curious come along there 's a good mix of experienced and entry level players and as a group we 're very welcoming so do n't be shy .
bring your own decks if you have them but if not there will be some spare decks .
if you 're bringing your own do bear in mind we 're still finding our way and most decks being played are low power .
you 're welcome to bring more competitive decks for their interest value but you wont get much of a match up playing them .
the night starts at 7 and we have reserved the conservatory area .
mine was pokemon y. i bought my 3ds xl unit second hand yeah more inexpensive .
my 3ds xl was a limited edition pokemon xy red and was bundled with pokemon y game worth 7500 pesos way back 2014 .
i was extremely excited to play it that time .
the game was greatly improved in terms of graphics as compare to the previous ds games .
i still have the game and will keep it till the future .

he kind of tore in to them for asking it in the first place and how he does n't run that kind of campaign .
it was beautiful i 'm sure someone will give you an exact quote .
so basically they 're saying women ca n't stand conflict and would rather be able to tell people what to do instead of having to argue why it 's good
i do n't really have a suggestion as it 's not something i 'm particularly good at .
just wanted to make a comment along the lines of yay durham !

does anyone know what the deal is with these fw 190 people ?
it seems like every so often i 'll pull up the roster at the start of the match even in ground forces and it will say that one or two people on my team just joined in a fw 190 and have already disconnected .
suddenly i realized why nothing i did ever seemed to work i needed different instructions and methods .
i 've always likened it to everyone driving automatic while i was a stick-shift the same rules of the road applied but how you went about them was subtly different and what worked for everyone else would have me in a ditch .

how many 4 recruits is rutgers pulling this year again ?
but this class is still the best class we 've pulled in recent times and ranks 6th in the conference right now .
this is coming from the team that finished 12th last year so that 's pretty damn good .
if haskins and keandre decommit that sucks but we have multiple other 4 recruits trending for md .
but i 'd love to be able to play cards like rhys the redeemed or brutal hordechief in kresh shu yun or vexing shusher in mizzix the list could go on for a while .
i just really want more options and the ruling does n't really make sense as i could cast those cards with no change to any other mana rules whatsoever .

your nmom is demanding your attention in a physical way .

i served with this guy for four years and i can tell you that he did a lot of sucking up to the chief 's quarters .
he got himself into the good ol ' boys club '' which is why he was able to qualify everything up to doow so quickly .
so basically if you play the game right you 'll advance .
bernie sanders has been saying the same things supporting the same things and voting the same way for fifty years .
i think he 'll do the same thing as president .
not to say he 'll be able to do much unless we take congress as well .
but i do n't think he 'll change his spots as obama did .
well to be fair lots of non video game companies released their own android game consoles afterwords .
warren was 2nd only to biden in terms of people actively trying to get her to run .
she almost did n't even want to run for senate and probably only did because she was blocked from the position obama originally nominated her for .
if that is the reason she died then that 's shitty robot design even if she 's a prototype .

i 'm not the person you asked nor can i vouch for her strength in standard but in limited she is a straight bomb unsurprisingly .
in two of my games she came down when i had less than 5 life wiped the board and her 1 ability kept my opponent off balance long enough to pull out a win .
in another game her 0 ability helped break a locked up board by letting me cycle through my lands .
i 'm having a hard time imagining her not eventually being a house in standard even if she does n't have a home right now .
also dropping her xing her to death to wipe the board then returning her to my hand with greenwarden of murasa was probably my favorite sequence of the prerelease .
i think they did get peaceful happy endings but the problem is that this is the first season in years that i felt horror instead of camp glam and shock value .
i just wanted this to be the real horror season .
horror went out the window a few episodes before when there were rainbow-kitten-youtube videos and angry white boy crumping with brandy .
every season has an episode where things go off the rails batshit insane in a way that is absolutely not horror but usually fun to watch .
this season went farther than i 'd have thought and the moment was well worth watching .

because i 'm not even making an argument right now i 'm just trying to establish terminology so that the argument can actually be made with some degree of mutual understanding of what is actually being said .
people are so concerned with arguing against marx that they wo n't even allow for the concepts he uses to be defined in order for his actual arguments to be discussed .

if you are not sure you do/can love them any more than leave as soon as you can .
they are going to need to do some serious rebuilding regardless and they do n't need any thing else negative getting in the way .

i did n't really discuss it in the article but i think this is a real difference between people who are principally pen users me and those who are principally collectors you .
i think collectors draw a lot of satisfaction from having a complete set however they define that and imposing a cap is going to limit how much satisfaction they can take from their collection .
but it 's likely the complete opposite for users .
i did n't factor that in because it will be a net positive for families making 250k per year .

he is the liberal version of what on the conservative side would faith based zealotism .
the ends justify the means he is willing to fudge facts and hurt a lot of people on the way because he know 's his cause is just .
meanwhile it 's all a lie he tells himself to justify just being an immoral film maker to begin with .
please do not use old installation guides like this one and always use the up-to-date wiki instead .
hi ryan so glad you are an infinite jest guide .
i 'm over here wondering what i 'm doing as well !
the war on drugs '' and for profit prisons grew up with each other .
the more people the war '' sent to prison the more prisons were needed .
some industrious and very racist individual and/or group of individuals decides that crack a black drug '' use/possession should be sentenced much harsher than cocaine a white drug '' .
this causes a disproportionate rise in incarceration rates for blacks .
knowing this police forces are more prone to search blacks for drugs than whites .
this also causes more disruption to black families than white families leading to more at risk black youth than white youth .
extend this pattern for two generations and you get institutional racism 1 trillion in war on drugs '' spending and the for profit prison industry and in the case of marijuana the medical industrial complex laughing their way to the bank .
not to oppose any new answers or conversation here but this is one of the most commonly asked questions on the subreddit .
you can find lots of information on the subject in the faq setion here https www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/wiki/faq/religion wiki_did_jesus_exist.3f .
to quickly summerize those excellent posts yes there is considerable documentary evidence from many sources that support jesus as a real living historical figure .
i 'm glad mango won but my respect for hbox went up for sure .
here i was wanting a more restricted fast travel system haha
while the story portrays the special region 's technological inferiority in many ways it is n't trying to characterize the entire society as morally inferior just the antagonists .
hence why rape is only incorporated into the narrative when the prince is introduced and not before .
but i 'm arguing that its incorporation is poorly done and there are much better ways to characterize the prince than to throw in a rape scene .
so i guess either due to starvation by being stuck or a sudden plummeting to my death .
i like the idea of death by plummet i really hate heights but i think i could deal with it if i was inside a small box .
i go through an easy 10-15ml close too 20 some days at 6 now that i have my nebox .
his message and campaign resonante with young voters who use the internet .
i love it when people say that in a panic .
mustangs are n't designed to kill people though your question would be better if you had said viper '' .
seriously though being able to sue a gun maker if someone commits a crime with a gun is stupid .
lots of questionable moments with sky where he focuses the entire stream on himself .
this was my biggest problem honestly he was a huge distraction to the stream .
it was like the sky williams show at some points .
i gave cruz the 3rd because he got the cleanest shot with that uppercut at the end of a good combination .
i understand people giving cruz 1-2-3 even though i disagree but no way he won the last two .
i think you might not be giving bulgaria enough credit .
faber isnt what he used to be but i am not sure about easy fight
thanks for the advice i 'll definitely have to keep these things in mind as i continue recording .
this was our second attempt at recording all on one mic and i 'm just starting to brush up on how to produce so the link you sent is perfect !
tracking volume is not the main issue holding back roomscale on the rift .

i 'm 99 sure hogarth is returning in iron fist 's show
sounds nice for the average consumers but it 's really a horrible thing .
americans are already huge assholes about pollution with the big suv 's and trucks that get 2 mpg .
now gas is going to be super cheap as well ?
hell the government does n't even have the balls to levy a meaningful gas tax to pay for road repair which is why the highway trust fund is constantly empty and roads are more lunar landscapes from all the potholes than actual roads..
they 're not centrally administered so they all do things differently .
weird looks like standford agrees with me and not you .
the 1 where raiden and white noise got kicked out of trib by goons ?

the pontiac gto based on the holden was a pretty damn good car .
and this is from the same people who called him a communist ... what debate was cnn watching ?
the mk4s apparently did n't hold up to well in terms of build quality .
as for reliability i think they were pretty reasonable still .
if you do wan na go for the mk5 the fsi engine may be a better option as they are pretty solid and provide decent power without a big price .
i 'd probably not touch a tdi for now just to see what vw is gon na do .
it was the 2.0 petrol with the automatic sure it was n't that fast but boy did it handle well .
not sure maybe because it 's an older web page .
i wonder if perhaps any sufficiently skilled dust mage can pull off a storm but being a maiden means you start with enough power to do it easily .
put another way glynda had to work her ass off to be strong/skilled enough to pull of that storm but jaune with maiden powers could casually shit it out on a bad day ?
have you experienced any non scale victories ie not getting winded as easily being more comfortable in waiting room chairs etc yet ?
i do n't know ... ..the level of information the government has on us is pretty ... ..*penetrating .
actually she had full clearance to do everything that she did .
they 're to long and boring for my taste .
edit jeez downvoting me cause i do n't like a movie ?
i 've got a couple of those in my rotation and they 're not bad at all i would n't worry about it .
it 's the 3000mah ones that have started to come out in 10a cdr which is unreasonable compared to the 15-20a version they originally came out as .
spent ages looking around to see if i could find a stash of the mines there .
kendal actually seems very grounded considering the family she 's in .
communication is the key here as well as what you feel is the right thing to do .
if sex does help you make up your mind in the long run i would say sleeping with both to see compatibility is not against the rules but you do have to be aware of how it would make either of them feel if they find out .
the biggest problem with trying to give advice is that none of these situations and people are ever the same .
in the end you have to make the judgement call because these two might react differently than the next two should it happen again p .
i think you should bring it up with one or both of them maybe not directly and see how they feel before you make any decisions .
he 's easily the best part of it apart from the nice set-pieces the mech suit section towards the end of the game is very satisfying too .
wiki is saying the formula is damage 100 √ó unmitigated damage protections 100 ?

i love copenhagen but my past half dozen cans of snuff were similar .
he 's actually been fairly productive when he 's been on the floor and he put up 17 fp in 17 minutes last time mahinmi was out .
obviously nobody expected 40 but i do n't think it was that far-fetched to hope for 20-25 points with mahinmi out and a weak denver interior .
i 've grinded strikes and nf 's almost every day for month 's and not a single strike specific emblem yet destiny can be cruel sometimes ...
buying 5 different yeasts gets expensive very fast and i also do n't drink those huge amounts of beer .
if i brew 5 gal all the time i could only brew 5-6 times year and still would n't be able to drink it all
but i guess i can always split it up in two batches of 1 gal each
i 'd be interested but two alone a commune or communist territory does n't make .
we 'd have to find like-minded people who are n't bullshitting so reddit is n't really a good platform for organization .
plus there 'd have to be a proletarian militia made of the community against the bourgeois state .
the puns are quite obvious but i think they are nice in some way or another .
if i could add a suggestion to the use of wow model viewer you can also use it for more advanced character insertions .
it gets a bit of effort on making them look like they 're inside but you can achieve things that you ca n't just get ingame .

lifting everyday is going to make you mighty sore ! ! ! !
other people will be able to give you more specific advice but i think 3-4 lifting sessions a week is plenty as you 've got to allow your body time to recover !
going for a walk on your off days would be a great way to keep up the exercise routine .
why are the laws for wall street as they are though ?
it 's because they have invested so much money into their politicians to keep things as they are and to deregulate their line of business .
the curse of being popular in general but especially on the internet .
your early stuff becomes a meme and gets endlessly quoted and repeated .
then when you try to move on to new things people constantly throw the old quotes at you and just want everything to be a rehash of what came before .
not to mention the first wo n't throw an exception if persons is null or undefined .
i think you put the parenthetical edit about your husband into the bit about your grampa .
all it takes is one person to decide you 're going to be downvoted .
season 3 is very ai heavy a lot of artificial intelligence and i think we 're going to figure out how we came to this place why we even left earth in the first place .
we 're going to learn even more of a backstory and also travel into a dimension that i 'm still having trouble trying to understand but i think it 's going to become clearer as we get deeper and deeper into it .
we have a lot of wild ‚Äì i do n't know i ca n't even describe it .
i 've never acted in scenes like the ones we 're doing this season .
maybe it was because you enjoyed it but there a long stretch especially because of intern joe that babu would be in almost every live video .
hubs convention videos even putting him on creature talk videos .
when talking about this i 'm talking more about a few cards burned from coldlight and not about brann mukla or coin lorewalker .
you may want to talk to piper i'v got her working on a rota for the lines .

any explanation on why the spoke pattern is correct even though it looks imbalanced ?
is sex tourism and rich pedophiles from asia going into norway to buy underage girls a big issue ?
i am not chewing this over with you now .
if you want to be stuck on the point of what of tourist to thailand are sex tourists then we can find relevant statistics .
how would this number even be collected or inferred ?
i appreciate your stance on going in with eyes open .
sad friendless lonesome yeah i have friends and they 're all fine people .
thus far my attempts to sucker them into elite dangerous have n't been overwhelmingly successful .
the more things get integrated with the core os the more you have vendor lock-in .
you become more and more dependent on that one company be it google or apple .
already today it 's becoming more and more difficult to move away from one vendor .
i do agree though that integrated solutions oftentimes work much better .
not only was i filled with fear and shame but i was n't allowed to develop a self .
extra curricular activities were chosen for me throughout high school based on what the n 's in the family liked to do .
nm chose my school schedule all through even high school .
i got no say in anything and even expressing a political opinion different from my family 's got me yelled at .
i was n't allowed to go out and do the things other kids did and nfamily had money but was super stingy with me to make sure i did n't have the resources to do activities i wanted or socialize .
i was n't allowed makeup until senior year and i only got nm 's used cheap pharmacy makeup in her chosen colors .
i never got to choose what i wanted to do or eat for my birthday .
they pushed an adopted ethnic identity on me that is n't actually me .
anything i tried to do or be was stupid '' and however i looked was fat and ugly '' .
anything i tried to wear looked terrible on me in their eyes .
i was so quiet as a kid teen going adult .
i rarely talked to anybody or tried to get involved in anything .
i thought i 'd just be ridiculed and rejected by peers .
i moved out at 24 and while i had a secret idea of who i truly was i only started to develop into that person after moving .
i was over 30 by the time i truly knew who i was and was totally comfortable with it .
this is why i buy my niece clothes from the boys section .
not as bad as that other guy from day 2 beside keitaro .
that guy needed to move his mic about a mile from his face .

and by far podemos have done much more good for the spanish population since they are holding power on big cities than the ones accusing them did in 30 years they had the power to do it .
and it 's true and that means i have to accept it even when i voted other parties but i live in one of those cities and you can see how the city is improving and how some marginal areas are starting to improve .

bernie 's plan will cost over 6 trillion less than the current health care system over the next ten years .
the united states currently spends 3 trillion on health care each year‚Äînearly 10,000 per person .
reforming our health care system simplifying our payment structure and incentivizing new ways to make sure patients are actually getting better health care will generate massive savings .
this plan has been estimated to save the american people and businesses over 6 trillion over the next decade .
the typical middle class family would save over 5,000 under this plan .
last year the average working family paid 4,955 in premiums and 1,318 in deductibles to private health insurance companies .
under this plan a family of four earning 50,000 would pay just 466 per year to the single-payer program amounting to a savings of over 5,800 for that family each year .
businesses would save over 9,400 a year in health care costs for the average employee .
the average annual cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes 50,000 a year would go from 12,591 to just 3,100 .
literally just copying and pasting from there website to show you ya they understand that .
it 's almost like they understand how healthcare works who would have ever thought that ?
well im still relatively new to this game and a prize like this would really help me out a lot as i dont have a massive amount of time to play just now !
what wouldve been a little more clever was acrually answering questions people have asles her on there as her more subtle .
to all of the people having an i-feel-so-bad-for-her orgasm all they did was delete some shit that isnt super important and post some silly stuff .
it 's not like they threatened her or something .
300 for a press event where you get to demo games is ludicrous .
it 's not a developer conference where you learn anything .
who would pay that amount just to demo the vive ?
where is the link to buy tickets if they exist ?
why does the article only link to a reddit comment about it actually being free ?
common sense tells us it 's a free and invite only event .
they are working on something obviously but it will probably be a quite awhile before it actually hits stores .
if you really want a new 3ds then now or near future is probably the time to buy .
actually you just missed all the sales but for the holiday season but what 's done is done .
i think those songs should switch places the one that plays in smash does n't fit smash but would work very well in ki u while the one that plays there would be better in smash
jones was different though he was suspended for being a fuckwit doing drugs and running a muck his title was vacated wrongly when it really should of been an interim situation .
i get the logic but it 's still shitting on the accomplishment of tj .

the size of the grimm invasion coming with goliaths and all minus the atlesian fleet vale fucked .
their dying eyes are wide and white like snow and now they know the cost of trusting you 's obliteration ''
after cinder 's speech the public are already a lot less trusting of the hunters and atlesians .
they are feeling unsafe even without the threat of grimm .
now they know the cost of trusting you 's obliteration ''
this is a much more useful rundown of why i should consider an upgrade !
imagining myself someday cuddling with my wife just reading a book talking or relaxing and my two girls running out their room yelling mommy daddy look what we made '' and showing us something totally ridiculously stupid and me and my wife getting all excited about it and omg now i 'm crying .
i 'm surprised he actually knows the order of the months
they buy in to conor 's opinion that tj is a snake for switching camps basically which is fucking stupid since people switch camps all the time .
yes urijah brought him in but he was under no obligation to stay under tam for the rest of his career .
so having the option to move with duane was the best one in terms of skill development .
you train at a camp with a guy who brought you in and showed you the ropes .
you do well and then this new coach comes in your gym .
he makes you do really well and ups your game significantly this is based on my maybe limited knowledge on duane 's impact on tj since i have n't followed his career up to the point of beating renan barao the champ and top p4p fighters .
your new coach decides to move and offers you to come with him .
do you a stick with your team because you value loyalty more than career progression .
b move with your coach to keep improving your game .
keep in mind also that people switch camps so that 's to counter the snake '' argument .
he was brought up by urijah ok but pretty much every fighter out there even urijah were brought up by someone else and moved on .

if this is shown to be linked to the financial melt down of 2008 i would love for bernie to come out and say you know what ?
if it was a mistake he should own it and move on .
we recently got a kid who comes in twice a week and tries to buy an m rated game without his id or a parent/guardian .
every time i ask he 's like are you serious ? ''
i thought both spawn points were good in their own way .
the capture point however was definitely not in the middle of the map !
still better than an almighty evil god who kills whoever he wants for no reason other than his pleasure .
will have to pay extra attention to that episode next time .
after asking which type the other guy suggested one that gets rid of me fast .

i personally play proxy and fletcher but i 'd like to discuss proxy .
personally since the buff on springy and flying pig perks i 'd say proxy is not so handicapped as she was before because that means she could specialise on being a really fast glass cannon that could suicide-rush with specific loadouts the h22 and the ke23 namely with tryhard and be a force to be reckoned with if used right .
the h22 and the r41 for example have springy which opens a whole new series of proxybilities possibilities as she basically becomes a speed demon provided knowledge of longjumping and walljumping is had .
added to the fact that mines can be prematurely detonated and it 's very easily seen that proxy is really good at burst-damage hit-and-run encounters .
i adamantly disagree that proxy is the weakest link when it comes to the three engineers .
i would argue she has her own niche at least and could really change the tide of battle provided the team could support her .
as for a first anime my daughter and i would suggest death note instead of aot due it 's more universal appeal .
how you live your life is up to you but personally i think you 're managing it totally wrong .
i 'd have bought a couple of houses and a flat in london living in the flat and handing over the management duties to a company to look after the property .
then sack off your job and do something you 're passionate about !
ill be looking for where to try to post it next because i dare say it wont stay here too long .

i had 2 and 3 decisive for cruz 4 was decisive for tj and i was fairly certain he had 1 .
5 i was unsure of tj seemed to land more total strikes but cruz threw like 3 or 4 flurries which seemed to be the most effective strises that round .
i gave the fight to cruz but i wanted him to win so probably have some bias in my decision .
i go to the range as few as two and as many as six times a week .
i have carry mags loaded with carry ammo both of which were tested extensively enough to satisfy me that they are reliable with my weapon of choice to use as ccw .

my studio monitors will be set up once ive built my desk using xlr to 1/4 '' cables .

that would be a lot of cable tie jobs lol .
the noise and interference would be picked up from data cables power supplies allot of things .

its a like 2 year old failed to color in side the lines .
but i loved it it made me feel much more girly .
i hide it from everyone because explaining why you have purple toenails as a male is hard .
but this weekend i forgot my socks when i was making breakfast .
so i said fuck it and painted my finger nails i have no idea how this is going to go .
just painted them was away from my nail polish for the weekend but i assume its going to bring me on step closer to coming out .
also does anyone have any advice on how to paint my nails ?

just got this in the mail after a long wait from aliexpress.com .
flipped it a bit and cut a piece of cardboard that 's all .
blade is very sharp supposedly d2 with a nice stonewash and an even edge .
it has some very slight locrock but no side to side play .
gave it a few light spine wacks to see if the lock would slip over and it did n't i would n't be afraid of it ever failing it feels indredibly solid otherwise .
both the flipper and thumbstuds work incredibly well with no issues .
very well built and impressive knife for the price and for it being a clone !

i have humana national pos open access through my dad and i want to get mirena .
i spoke with a humana customer service rep and she told me preventative care including all mirena related expenses would be 100 covered for all insured women through the affordable care act but i 've had a lot of trouble with humana customer service in the past and i 'm worried that she may be wrong .
how should i approach my gyno 's office about the process of ensuring that everything wo n't actually cost me ?
anyone else have a humana plan that includes preventative care for women and recently get an iud ?
how was your experience with humana through the process ?
my parents are conservative and would n't be cool with me getting on bc and on the chance that it 's not covered and they get an 800 bill they will lose their shit and ask me what they 're paying for .
i do n't think i would be able to convincingly lie to them ? ?
also i would prefer not to about something so expensive .
they do n't really care that i 'm an adult and should be able to have safe sex without fearing a negative reaction from them .
they think i should wait until i 'm married and the emotional labor required to convince them otherwise is too damn much .
seems to me like i have better aim when i play core than when i play hardcore .

i started taking accutane just over 2 weeks ago and had a pretty bad initial break out .
i had big inflamed white heads all over my cheeks and chin and around my mouth .
it was so itchy and painful and i felt reeeeally depressed about it .
i have n't left the house much lately and when i do go out i have to wear tonnes of makeup to have any shred of confidence .
even then i ca n't talk face to face with people staring at my acne .
over the last few days the ib has completely calmed down .
my face is n't incredibly red and inflamed anymore the itching stopped the bumps are going down and for the first time in a long time i 'm starting to see the true texture of my skin again .
in the past this would happen occasionally but i 'd always wake up with a bunch of new sore pimples .
i still have a long way to go and i 'm assuming i 'll still get a few breakouts over the next few weeks but i can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel .
no one else in my life gets how significant that is for me but i 'm sure you guys understand .
maybe i 'm getting ahead of myself here maybe it is finally working but either way it does n't hurt like fuck today and i 'm real happy about that .
i 've been working on it since last week and i 've got him up to sa8 .

okay so i know the obvious answer is to see a doctor.. but there is no way i can get all of this figured out between now and the weekend .
i also tore or damaged my mcl and sustained a tibial plateau fracture at the same time .
all of these things were relatively minor showed up on the mri and not the xray .
i was in a brace and on crutches for a while and then recovered through physical therapy not surgery .
like 4 or 5 times a week for 10 hour days a lot .
after the injury i skied once at the end of the season.. and then once again last winter .
my knee only bothered me a little but it was nothing bad .
my knee pops from time to time and can get more sore than the other.. but i have n't looked into it .
just recently i have started having problems with it at random times .
it 's usually whenever i 'm going down something and my leg is in the air.. and then the pain comes from putting it back on the ground .
i know that i need to see my sports doctor again but i do n't even know if i 'll get an appointment for a month .
i 'll do whatever i can to make it happen .
i do n't want to damage anything.. but would taking an advil and just going for it be fine ?
i do n't think that it 's anything other than the whole meniscus thing acting up again i do n't know why it would but that 's what it feels like .
i can still walk it 's just that the issues happen randomly .
i know that putting heavy ski boots and skis on my legs wo n't be that great.. but i want to try .
i ca n't get a proper ski brace but i have the kind of knee brace that you slide on and it has supports on either side .
i 'm sure other people on the forum have had this issue !
i did n't know too loaders used an rf cable and i do n't think my tv has an rf input .
is there any adapter or anything i can but to make it go from rf to av ?
so i recently got the freddy funko pop that comes with the funklub kit .

previously i would put myself and my family threw hell and relapse after a few days or weeks over and over again.. then wind up on a six month bender find myself in the er transfer to detox transfer to rehab .
this go around was inspired by a major health problem at 28 i had a heart attack .
and it was explained to me on multiple occasions that it was the booze and muscle damage done to my heart .
i have a lot to live for do n't i ?
why ca n't i stop doing this to myself .
on day 181 i got my hands on a bunch of xanax and vodka and started partying it up alone of course .
luckily it only lasted a week before i wound up in the hospital with chest pain .
more heart damage neuro damage liver damage and god knows what else .
oh yea pneumonia from aspirating vomit while passed out alone .
why could n't i have just died instead of waking up ?
that would have been easier and better for everyone .
before this turns into ranty loony babble i 'll just end it .
really just no one to talk to figured i had to tell someone what the past few weeks have been like in my life .
i am not under 18 but i have a sneaking suspicion that my t levels are lower than they 're supposed to be .
i 'm almost 24 and they 're in the low 400s .
when i do preliminary google searches my number is lower http elitemensguide.com/testosterone-levels-by-age than the average http www.menshormonalhealth.com/normal-testosterone-levels.html according to those two sites .
when i emailed my doctor i got told the following
your t level is very appropriate for your specific health need .
i do not advise that you increase your dose at this time .
and i am not a doctor ... but i do n't trust her .
does anyone have any resources for young under 18 cisgender guys ' t levels to make sure i 'm not low for going through puberty ?
i know i 'm low for men in their 20s but i just want to make sure before i go through the hassle of switching providers .
i 've been on gel for 2 months and i have yet to really see any changes other than a very small amount of genital growth and an insatiable hunger for both food and sex .
polar_ocelot was on trial this evening for the charges of
the retrial of polar_ocelot was held at 5:00 pm pst in the international court at mandis .
due to a lack of players for a jury the trial was held as a bench trial with dogboy07 presiding .
upon the agreed upon trial time polar_ocelot did not appear at court and was found in contempt of the court .
the public defender assigned to polar_ocelot mr_palmer declined to present a case due to his absence from court and the judge was forced to render a verdict of

i 've searched through the other posts but did n't have much finding information on nicer places to live in cypress or nearby .
most of the posts are asking about places near santa ana irvine or the coast cities .
are there any apartment complexes we should be looking at or property management organizations that would make our search easier .
budget is 2k a month for a 2 bed 1.5 bath near freeway .
i would love to find a small home with a yard instead of an apartment complex .
i hate the thought of having to share walls with people again .

i 've been following politics for a while but never realized how important staying on message actually is in a campaign .
the reason donald trump is doing do well is because he knocks his opponents off message with a combination of saturation media coverage brilliant labeling of his opponents low-energy nasty lightweight on his part and ironically and staying relentlessly on his message of knocking his opponent off message .
this is also why sanders is doing so well he relentlessly stays on message .
terrorists attacks in paris the night before the debate he talks about income inequality email scandal he talks about income inequality .
some people say sanders is n't running a real campaign because he does n't attack clinton at least not usually .
now that he finally is attacking clinton he 's doing it on message talking about campaign finance and what he calls the oligarchy .
the reason trump 's message is so brilliant is that it 's basically you 're leaders are stupid and weak '' so that any attack by trump is still on message .

i 'm starting my second semester of college tomorrow .
it sucks because first semester two of my friends met their now boyfriends in their classes and i already know that will never happen to me .
in college it seems that everyone has already paired up and i 'm stuck behind watching it all happen scared to see more of my friends pair off .
edit we are no longer taking people at this time .
however if you have already sent a pm or left a comment prior to this edit you are still up for consideration .
my group of friends is looking for people interested in playing tabletop dungeons and dragons .
we do not require that you have a character or any experience with the game prior .
we 're relatively new to the game so it 'll be a learning experience for everyone .
our situation is that we do n't have many people to play with .
being the only one with real dnd experience in the current group i can serve as a dm we just need characters .
we use version 3.5 of the player handbook monster manual and dungeonmaster guide .
most people in our group are between 18 and 20 years old .
although we do not discriminate based on gender race or sexual orientation it would probably be best if you were within or lingering around our age group .
also because we 're playing tabletop you 'll have to be in our area to play .
we 're set up in the southwest of the usa .
if you 're interested leave a comment and i 'll send a pm where we can discuss specific details such as age or location which may be sensitive for some people to post openly on reddit .
obviously i would prefer it to be all the time but this is huge considering last week he would get really defensive when i suggested it .
when we move in together in the future he will probably be eating vegan the majority of the time because i 'll be doing most of the cooking

from what i 've read the plug and play nature of hdmi drivers essentially causes the computer to reinstall '' the drivers every time the tv/receiver is turned off and on again or the computer is rebooted .
it causes full screen windows to revert to a default state which i guess in my case windows are always resized to 800x600 and my speaker settings are always reset to default since i 'm doing audio over hdmi as well .
i 've scoured google and the best i saw was that someone mentioned you 'd have to use a resource monitor to see which registry values apply to certain settings and create some sort of batch script to set them .
i do n't know how the heck to do that and even if i did i do n't know how i 'd get it to automate aside from being a startup script which does n't help me much as the pc is always on
i have a 2013 gibson sg standard with the stock pickups which i believe are the '57 classics still installed .
i just got home from a ten day tour with my band and every show i would play around with the equalizer on my rockerverb because the bridge pickup sounded almost dead to me .
currently i play in an easycore band called nice shot kid so we tend to use high gain .
i personally play more ambient sounding music where i play mostly on the clean channel .
i also primarily use the neck pickup when playing on the clean channel .
i want a pickup that can handle high gain well but also want a pickup that is crisp when playing on the clean channel .
i am currently looking at the seymour duncan jb pickup for the bridge and the jazz for the neck but i 'm not sure if these pickups are right for me .

this is where the two fields meet to collaborate and share .
to aid each other and possible unite a great team .

this story as i recall involved a daughter with a quite old father grandfather who took her on his boat and kept catching these very fantastically illustrated fish bright yellows with curly turquoise whiskers and fins and i believe she kept asking for a bigger one and a bigger one until the fish they catch is so big that it tips to boat and she falls in .
everything is fine at the end i think it 's only maybe a 10 page story .
if so i cant wait for the memories of co-op in portal 2 !
right so i 'm about 60 way through the js course on codeacademy and it 's gotten to the point now where the author 's explainations are inconsistent and make little sense .
the author also confuses object keys with placeholder names which is distracting because it makes me stop understanding .
anyway to cut a long story short this is why i always forget programming skills that i 've already learnt because the instructor always starts assuming you do n't need to ask questions and the hints '' codeacacdemy provides do n't make things simpler .
does anyone know a useful js reference list in the form of say a book video or website which does n't mean i have to go back to the start which is usually when your mummy and daddy love each other very much they write console.log to write to the console '' ?
if anyone wants to try and change my mind and help explain this lesson to me feel free preview to lesson http i.imgur.com/i2fyvbs.png
i can still barely understand the list function i just wrote .
it took a lot of guess work to get which order to put all those words in because var key in object '' is n't exactly the most useful example specially when it contradicted itself in what key actually meant and 'object ' is purple in the example completely obscuring the context .
so 'people ' is the main parameter which is referenced back by a completely new global var called 'listthese ' i 've told the console in the condition of the for loop that listthese '' means everything in '' the friends object which is typed manually when executing the function which works because 'people ' references whatever i type in the execution .
i only just understood that but now it 's just talking rainbows .

there 's now a second source referring to steven 's initial denial of having the bonfire on oct 31 .
as covered in my previous post https www.reddit.com/r/makingamurderer/comments/41i72l/we_didnt_start_the_fire_what_we_know_about_the on nov 6 brendan initially denied having the bonfire to investigators and on feb 27 fassbender told brendan
you know steven said there was n't a fire that night .
he denied that denied that and denied that until enough witnesses came forward and said that had they seen a fire ... .. you know that .
now a second mention of steven denying the bonfire comes on nov 30 2005 from gil halsted wisconsin public radio on the nancy grace show http transcripts.cnn.com/transcripts/0511/30/ng.01.html yeah yeah i know
gil halstead wpr well he did steven avery did an interview with the associated press in which he did say that he thought he was being framed and he believed that teresa halbach was still alive .
and he actually called on her to come home if she could hear him .
he said a number of things to the reporter including that he really believed that he 's being framed and that some of the evidence found against him he had explanations for .
that`s why blood was found around his trailer and his garage .
he says that spent rifle shells that were found in his garage were there because his nephews had been shooting in the area .
he changed his story that he had told investigators before about a fire that where the bone fragments of teresa halbach were found .
now he says that he actually was burning tires and brush there on halloween which is the day that teresa halbach disappeared .
still no direct sources yet but where there 's smoke ...
i have n't talked to almost all of you in quite awhile .
normally i would n't reach out to the internet actually never but my closest friends are hammered and now in bed .
so i have dated a girl for a bit over four years now .
long story short i know in my heart of hearts that this relationship is going nowhere and it needs to end .
i 've never experienced a breakup of this calibre before and i 'd love to hear input from people who understand my situation .
does anyone know if there is anything in english about belgium brussels or the euro bubble ?
i have changed myself from a meek voiced person to a strong and confident voiced person in normal situations .
but during confrontations i still can not project all my aggression into my voice like many people seem to .
as a result people can dominate me just my being louder than me and my logic is completely overshadowed by their loudness and by me not getting my voice heard .
this is also a problem in a group setting/public forum .
i always get concious of how unnatural it would seem for me to blow my lid since i am the calmest person all the time .

amazon fire tv 4k seems to have the best performance based on reviews .
hi ladies as title says i 'm a regular poster who has made a throwaway to hide my deep and disgusting shame .
the throwaway relates to my real account i do n't care if you ladies know which user i am but i just did n't want this linked to my other account because i think my partner might know it .
once he read my post about him being useless and shit and he actually let me sleep in .
i have bipolar disorder so i am used to generally being mentally unwell .
afterwards just fine my baby is amazing smart funny healthy and sleeps pretty well he is not the problem .
i just want to die and it 's not even his fault .
all of the post partum support focuses on the baby what to do for your baby how you can best bond with your baby .
i feel like even to doctors i do n't matter anymore all they want to talk about is my kid .
i feel like i could die now before he has any memories of me or i would have to wait until he is an adult himself as to not fuck him up entirely .
i do n't think it 's post partum depression i think it 's just the bipolar thing which means i get to live with it forever .
i 'm not taking any meds because i missed an appointment and now i 'm way too embarrassed to go back and they just make me tired and fat and dumb and i ca n't take them because my partner thinks it 's ridiculous that he should have to get up at night because i stay home even though the fucker only works like 30 hours a week at a non demanding job does no housework wo n't learn to drive so i have to take him and in general is terrible emotional support .
the only think they 'll offer me is the hospital but what good is it no one can look after my baby and i do n't want to wean him like the only think i can do right is make milk for him and i do n't want to leave him .
i think he 's going to die all the time when i 'm driving .
i 've tried to kill myself like four fucking times so i doubt i 'm in any real actual danger .
i also know that i could feel better in like 3 months .
i just do n't know what to do in the mean time i really do n't .
i get up feed baby dress him half heartedly play with him whilst he smiles and crawls and is just generally so excited on life while i sit on my phone or just lie on the floor .
i hardly take him anywhere he eats a lot of toast fruit steamed veg i do n't take him to any classes .
i feel like i 'm just waiting for everything to be done with .
tlrdr want to die but no one cares everything is about the baby ca n't do anything pointless rambling .

tldr disable or remove the home home theme and home chooser apks .

i had this idea of how my world became to be the way it is ... now i could just fob it off to there was a strange flick in social development that changed our way of thinking ... that made sex out to be not be a shameful thing ... to not be hidden away and for us to see it as a normal thing to get ones rocks of in mall ... buuuut i think it would be so cooler if say the world changed because of natural selection ...
when man was starting to stretch their fingers across the world a time where our evolutionary scale could tip with a single generation a small kink in the code changed ... where most women were normal others weren't..
they were hungry but not for food not for water for man !
they breed more often than the others and soon the 'normal ' woman dies out all we are left with are the hungry ones .
and of course they chose the men who are the most able most adept and best match for their appetites .
and this bread men who are perfect for fucking .
through generations upon generations this has made a world were to fuck is like to eat ... and that 's how i see the
our history is a lot like my history we have countries and politics we war and we have music and movies ... just a little different than normal tv ... during the sexual revolution the woman became vessels for everything and soon there is no asking ... it is not a gentleman 's world anymore ... sex is no longer a private and hidden thing ... and women are treated more like toilets and fuck toys than humans ...
in a world like this there would have been evolutions in tech that we do n't have in this one ... evolutions like body mods that are tailored for this lifestyle .
this is generally added by fathers at a young age but there are many more ... like the adjustable sensory settings that allow the user the ability to change the pleasure a woman will get ... or there is always gag removal or permi-wet ... mods that allow a man to produce more seamen and extend the cock mid fuck and create essentially a knot inside the woman ... .
i 'd love to describe it in more detail if you 'd like
see this is a big fantasy of mine ... and to some it will be odd and probably make no sense just because of the logistics ... . buuuuut i 've been looking forever for something like this on sights like literotica but i find they are either too short or all sex or just badly written ...
anyway i should stop blithering around ... my fantasy is that i 'm dating a woman who is only about 1-2 inches tall ...
i want to be a giant in her eyes ... in every way .
now it will take some creative thinking but i think that this will be a fun rp/story .
i would like to have been dating for a few months now ...
i 'm not bothered by the looks i get as you 're riding on my shoulder through the mall ...
i 've gotten used to not being able to penetrate you ... you 're masterful with your hands and mouth anyway ... and we 've discussed it ... but not played it out but you said if i wanted to bring a girl home we could both have fun ...
so if you 're a creative writer and you like the idea of being my pocket sized lover pm me ... or maybe you have something to add/edit ...
or if you 're not really into an au fantasy than i 'd like to do an violent rp ... it 's a big turn on to have a woman want to be waled on ... and it gets me excited just thinking about it .
let 's say that we have been married now for a few years and every night you have my dinner ready while i eat you go and prepare yourself in the bedroom for a very very rough night ... where i will really wale on you .

i 'm the person who made the upcoast channel 5 '' series of weather channel based youtube videos .
recently i thought about collaborating with an artist to release a vhs paired album through bandcamp in the same way cassettes are sold now .
the album would be released at my bandcamp https upcoast.bandcamp.com with the vhs being sold as merch .
the artist would receive a generous cut of the proceeds from album sales as well as a free vhs tape with weather channel type visuals .
those who have seen my youtube channel https www.youtube.com/channel/ucm7vzlt5b5ee235b6klwbpq/videos ? sort=dd view=0 shelf_id=0 are aware that my aesthetic is based off of coastal weather channels in northern america and canada .
if anyone is interested feel free to contact me through reddit pms or on skype at jazzcat231 .
i am open to negotiation as this is my first time entering the world of bandcamp and selling music .
just swapped my front speakers for a more powerful pair and have the old fronts at the rear .
this means that the center channel which was in the matching set with the old fronts is different now .
i 've read that this can result in tonal mismatch when dialogue is part left/right part center .
i hardly watch any movies just gaming and music .
i always liked or i guess disliked but agreed with the idea that she might transform all the time because she 's not comfortable with herself .
does her eating give her the energy to sustain her lifestyle ?
2 i know the other pearls we 've seen recently have been in fairly stylistic settings but pearl seems to be a lot lighter than her peers .
i guess i always assumed she was a gift to rose and may be a pink diamond court member but what if she 's not ?
or is this just the hiatus getting to me ?
was in a pretty good run i walk into this room http i.imgur.com/6qwt4yj.png so i came i through the left door and killed the enemy which was a dank squirt .
so the enemy dies and immediately after there 's an explosion and i die the death screen says i died to poop .
i searched on the wiki in case there was a poop that could explode and there is n't one .
i was wondering if any of you guys have any ideas ?
edit i realise now that i have died due to the brown cap ...

i have this fellow player that got what seems to be softbanned ca n't recharge dropped items lost since weeks and ca n't seem to get out of it .
before you say she spoofed voluntarily or not i checked with her and do n't think she did .
she is just a casual gamer not that much invested in the game .
it would n't have been worth it to spoof that .
even if she did spoof she surely would have removed it and waited .
it 's been 3/4 weeks from what i read here that 's enough time .
she asked niantic and answered a copy/paste we only support official niantic labs software .
if we detect use of unofficial software that is deemed harmful to gameplay your account may be suspended or terminated . ''
she is n't a dev so i do n't think mock location was activated even once on her phone .
i do n't know about third party applications '' that automatically softban from ingress .
what can i ask her to check on her phone ?

well as some my be well aware chain chronicle is shutting down .
this is a pretty sad time for people who love the game but i 'm not letting this go not that easily .
i ca n't convince gumi nor sega to keep the game going but i can sure as hell make my own chronicle so the stories i like are n't forgotten .
i 'm planning to record everything i can but i 'm gon na need some help .
i can do the main stories but i can not get everyone and train them to get to their stories in time of the closure in feburary .
before we let the chain chronicle stories being lost to the records of time it 's time to record everyone 's stories the chain stories and the side stories .
there are replays of the stories throughout your journey so i and possibly you will be recording it that way .
here 's a quality test using reflector 2 logo will be gone when i get to recording the real deal https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=sulvxglbc7u
the things i can record are as of this time of writing
all side stories the queen 's acension the longest day academy festival desert lullaby howling in the mist guidence of fate
the dreams of maidens found later out of 15 chain stories in total .
all event quests as of writing this holy night festival volunteers ' new year dusty 's war sale 2 mid-term exams pure hearts attack !
dusty 's war sale 3 rookie training quest defeat the rampaging golem !
all free quests side story for phoena holy kingdom sage 's tower and lake of sand .
phew that 's quite a lot to type but i 'm not done yet there 's more .
as with above i 'll also be recording characters stories .
thankfully gumi made it extremely easier to level up 5x and do tasks costs 1 stamina so finally i 'll be able to level them all up .
i do n't have all of them though and i 'm gon na need help with the community so below are all of the characters numbered left to right from the top. .
if i do not have everyone and i wan na see everyone 's stories .
so starting below i have 220 characters as 2/13/2016 though some of which i need to level appropriately with their titles after name use ctrl-f to find someone specific ...
marina fervent healer story heavy character tier 1 and 2
kain virtous mercenary story heavy character tier 1 and 2
michidia reliable archer story heavy character tier 1 and 2
kristian magic academy pupil sort of he needs to be leveled up to effect another character

zaren demon of vengence found later beating titan 's cave
hatifas demon of truth need hati for complete story which i need to find
phew that took a night and a half to type but as you can see i got quite a lot to record and even then to train to beat to play to work just to keep these stories alive .
everyone it 's up to us to save a completed chronicle by recording those cutscenes from the missing chain stories and characters i do n't have on me .
if you are able please do what you can to help .
just do n't make it hard-to-read '' blurry or outta synch or do n't have a logo on the video file itself the player is fine i suppose but not on the video itself as i want us to keep these straight from the game as possible .
also do n't use an external camera to record the screen not worth it like that and i know you can do better .
i 'll handle everything mentioned above and if i find characters along the way before the final day of feburary 28th i 'll respond to this post .
for everything else if you do a character i 'll need ...
encounter when you first meet the cahracter not for all characters ''
the rest of the cutscenes from start to finish ''
the full chain chronicle story that i do n't have ''
if gumi/sega make it possible to play these stories for the missing parts above i do n't have like say on the last week of the game i 'll handle everything myself but until then i 'll need help to complete this chronicle .
i do n't care what version of the game your playing as long as the story is recorded .
if possible also take a pif of the arcana of the character full screened .
no reason for this one just want to see the art for this one .
if you yourself ca n't record share this post then so we may find someone who can .
contact me at over9000lagonic on twitter if you need me to explain this further
you know what i 'm gon na take this a step further who were your favorite characters from this game whether playable or not and why ?
not the focus of saving the stories but it might be worth sharing for enjoyment purposes .
all level 1 and 2 star characters have been found wooooo ! ! !
final total of the day some training and found all 1 and 2 star characters have been found tomorrow until friday at 7pm est i 'll work on training characters .
aoi ogre maiden which unlocked a new chain story yay the dreams of maidens ''
i got sick for a few days but from those days and today i found ...
nimpha fortunate soldier which will make getting chests a little easier after i train her a bit
i 'm aware some of these are outta order i must have mis counted somewhere above thanks to everyone down below and on the gumi chronicle fourms for letting me know ahead of time .
also thanks for cheffzeff for recording the intro prolouge that starts when you first get the game .
the audio is a little low quality but it 's still the prolouge nontheless .
i 'm running out of ways to getting characters i am still doing the missions that get me prysma but i finished all the ones that get me premium tickets and i 'm working towards doing the missions that involve using a certain class multiple times .
just saying that i may not be able to get that many more characters from here on though i hope to find taka for haruaki 's sake .
i also hope to find all of the characters that unlock the chain stories in time though likely that 's not gon na happen ... '' sigh '' ...
it only took me stacking 230 fourtunate rings and consting recruiting now i can focus on revive fruits for the rings
finally got paid got reflector 2 and now i 'm ready to record the game but first above is a recording test for both vertical and horizontal styles of recording let me know what you all think .
i 'll record tomorrow after work around the evening time to see what everyone thinks so i hope for some well written comments .
zaren demon of vengence which is gained after beating titan 's cave wooooo ! ! !
and it only took me like 30 deaths to get through .
first 30 allies and the first chapter have been recorded .
made a lot of progress in getting characters today thanks valentine 's event
recorded another ten allies ' stories up to 40 so far
goryou ruthless boss funnily enough not found through using honor tokens
oletta sea breeze chief just in time for the demon raid coming
baltro dawn maritime captain yes that guy you might have seen during the main scenario
wayne captain of the holy guard luckily not through the bonus mission so there 's one 10,000 fighting down
all level 1 and 2 characters have been recorded and edited expect a link to the playlist for it in the near future .
loletta demon of destruction which unlocked the chain story 2 .
nothing new except that but thanks gumi for haivng an event coming where i 'll be able to get hati weeee .
hopefully you 'll also have an event where i can get the chain characters eh ?
current progress in recording some of which is edited is as follows
side stories 1 through 4 involving character development for phoena have been recorded .
current length if you put every video together about 14 hours and 22 minutes give or take
i 'm trying to go through a mode of doing ten allies a day with a chapter or two all in a day everyday so phew i 've got my work cut out for me .
at least most of the characters i have have thier stories unlocked fully so there 's not much as grinding i need to worry about except for the prysma missions which made getting a ton of these characters so much easier .
right now i 'm saving them up for the coming event coming in a couple of days one of them being hati wooo .
maybe i might be able to find some chain story characters most importantly juliana but me getting all of the chain characters would be great .
next week on saturday you 'll see a similar update as above so you all know where i am on recording characters .
it 's getting harder to record everything in time so after hati and possibly juliana if i find her i have to stop searching for characters ...
last character i wanted to find before the end well at least second to last but getting juliana might be a little rough to do unless next week is a miricale week for chain characters .
recorded a lot today a couple chapters a side quest storyline and five allies and i feel i 'm running out of time ...
current progress in recording some of which is edited is as follows
side stories 1 through 4 involving character development for phoena have been recorded .
side quest story lines queen 's acension acadamy festival and the longest day have been recorded .
current length if you put every video together about 37 hours 10 minutes give or take
i 've decided to not worry about doing the events i 'm already overwhelmed with doing the side quests and chain stories to do because of how long they are to do once and again for recording .
i 'm deeply sorry but this is something i have to do i do n't have a lot of time left to do this and recording 6-8 hours every single day is exhausting and is pushing my will of doing it .
in order my order of importance of recording things are
free quests for some reason there 's some missing for the quest line for the stolen caravan so ca n't do that one
this is how i 'll handle things do n't know if i 'll even bother trying to recruit for the final event next week i 'm unsure if i could record them let me know what you all think in the comments below ... '' sigh '' ...
some recordings are done but to see the most important one watch this https youtu.be/_9xhklefjzg
the game 's gone there 's nothing left i can do to chronicle what 's left but my final total recording time and data stuff is ...
233 allies ' stories i got all of mine in the nick of time like barely a minute left ... recorded
the chain stories 2 3 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 15 .
most free quests are done just did n't allow me to finish the lost caravan storyline via chronicle though i recorded what i could .
all main story up to this point act 2 chapter 2 recorded
approximate length after some heavy math 81 hours and 499 minutes or 89.32 hours
i 'll start posting whatever on monday of next week but i need a nap and a break from chain chronicle cause i 'm burnt out thanks for everyone who has helped out during this process of archiving the chrochronicle and i 'll share more news in a brand new post so this shall be the last one here though i 'll still read the comments down below if anyone makes any ...
ho guts i rooted my phone using kingo root but i got a problem when i opened apps that require root access the window to allow or deny appears and even i clicked on allow the app still says that root access was not granted .
as the title says i spilled lemonade onto the bottom of my monitor my keyboard took a hit too but i was planning on replacing it soon so i 'm fine with just laving it .
it 's hard to explain here 's http imgur.com/ictxzlq a picture that shows it off fairly well it 's hard to see in a lot of cases the problem does n't show up on screenshots so i manually did it .
whenever i use the monitor part of the image is distorted showing different 'tinted ' for lack of a better word colours and blurry lines in a vertical rectangle .
sadly i was n't able to turn off the monitor immediately as i bumped the glass as i went to answer the door meaning i did n't see it for a few minutes .
i tried opening the back to see the damage but i ca n't figure out a way to do that without causing permanent damage the asus vx24ah only has one screw right in the middle near the hdmi ports and removing it didnt make any noticable difference .
at first i thought the problem was that it caused stuck pixels so i tried multiple methods of fixing them including applying pressure and rapid colour changes as seen in the screenshot but that did n't do anything noticeable unless i somehow did it wrong .
since the error does n't show up in application screenshots i think as someone who does n't know anything about monitors that something physical must have happened to the monitor but i do n't see how the distortion could have reached all the way up to the top when the spill only covered about a third of the way up .
any help would be appreciated either on how to remove the back or on how to fix it or on whether i have to get it professionally fixed/replaced .
let 's start with the fact that i love the addition of the hextech crafting .
i think it 's great we can get content for free playing with friends gets you keys/chest even easier .

this access is supervised by bank personnel and only those items can be removed then .

i do n't see it on the side panel but i 'm on an ipad
the library is wrtten in pretty much all c afaik and is basically a wrapper for opengl so it should be about as fast as you 'd need the only thing faster is the use straight opengl or poke the framebuffer directly not recommended
lots of console game emulators nes snes etc use sdl to render video and for the various video filters .
i capped my framerate at 30fps or 60fps i 'd have to look at the code again ... because that 's the refresh rate of the original game and as long as you can get decent refresh rates ur set .
a quick glance at it and i noticed a couple things .
1 you need to be quoting those variables when you call them i '' not i
2 i do n't see a reason you would need to have the foldername variable inside the loop it 's getting set for every file if all the files are in the same folder already .
set that outside the loop so its only done once .
yes honestly it makes for far less how in the fuck did i just get killed moments ''
three of them were sub ten kills and over twenty deaths .

i was running 25-30 miles a week before i got pregnant and dropped back to 15 miles/week although that 's what i 've done the past two years thanks to daylight savings time changes and an intense dislike of the treadmill .
i 've mostly just lost speed i typically run 5 miles at a time before i got pregnant i was running at an 8:30 pace now i 'm about a 9:45 10:00 pace at 18 weeks .
i find that the entire time i run i have the feeling of needing to pee but that i do n't actually have to go if i stop and walk it disappears .
it 's annoying but not enough for me to quit .
i do n't think i could increase my distance beyond 6 or 7 miles at this point but it sounds like you 're not planning to run any further than you do already so i 'd think you 'll be fine .
from what i 've been able to play around with it seems heavily based on excel .

but his weight is shifted to the front of the bike even to make this happen so the back wheels have little weight on them to begin with .
when he sat down the weight transferred back to the rear creating more friction for the spinning tires and taking only one rotation to build up to breaking point as you pointed out .
so with them already heated up and getting sticky it does n't take long before they will absolutely grip that one rotation and transfer the energy back to the bike .
the right rear tire is the one that gave away got grip because centrifugal force is also transferring the weight to that tire compounding the effect .
also the tire gripping against the curb already sent some of the energy to the bike preloading it for disaster .

she responded i 'm sure but it 's just better that he does n't think that this is okay . ''

if brits/other people believe something it must be right and the righteous thing right ?
i have my own problems with both trump and sanders but i also have an in depth understanding of why they are where they are .
the only reason brits understand sanders is because he represents something and a mentality they are familiar with .
as much as i want to feel good about liking sanders there is also a real threat that sanders will usher in a european system where individuality is subjugated to uniformity .

i wish i still had acces to their forum to post some of the crap he does there or what does dictatorship look like .
you have no idea how much they can shit on you if you dont troll/flame but even put in discussion mittani anyone who never seen it really should .
one thing is to read his bs around but it really gets to you when you see how naive or stupid he is thinking his forum is better then reddit .
and btw they dont even post that much on sa '' .
i do n't really have much to go off of honestly .
i 've only ever attempted to date two people and both accepted .

did n't gibbs make a video asking to fix the ranked matchmaking ? sorry but if a best player in the world is suggesting it its for some reason
gibbs while he is a fantastic player that does n't mean he knows exactly what he is talking about .
ranked matchmaking in the higher mmr gold iii and higher does have issues .
these players at such a high skill level have less and less players to pair up with equal skill so it has to find players lower than their skill or higher much more often just to get a match .
usually they get matched with players below their skill level and lose 10 points a defeat and gain less than 5 per win .
it 's not broken it 's just there is n't very many chances to get an equal match at such a high mmr .
in gibbs ' playing with potatoes '' series he did n't even know he was facing silver ii opponents when he was in bronze iii due to how mmr skyrockets when a playlist first starts off .
he does n't even know how exactly trending works either .
i 'm not saying this to insult him but he never took the time to full on learn what is happening .
you ca n't defend something that ca n't be defended at all you are just trying to cover the sun with one finger
you ca n't attack something without knowing anything about it .
rl is not the only game with a broken mm btw you can defend it however you want but some people are not stupid dude .
no they are n't stupid however rocket league does not have broken matchmaking .
it works 99 of the time if not 100 given the rules it follows .
unsatisfactory results does not mean it is broken it means that people do n't like it .
while there are unfair matchups it happens through the rules of matchmaking .
if you want what 's really wrong with matchmaking hidden mmr and ranked this post https www.reddit.com/r/rocketleague/comments/414k6q/what_is_wrong_with_matchmaking_hidden_mmr_and suits quite nicely .
none of it is complaining about anything being broken .
it 's stating inefficiencies and problems that a player faces .
this is a proper way notifying about instances that are wrong without calling them broken .
so how in the hell these guys can have my same mmr
mmr rises faster than it falls for the first 30-60 games .
they went on a win streak and now their mmr has surpassed their ability .
which is irrelevant to whether or not that they 're ps4 because the same exact thing happens to pc players .
so if you have 100 hours just this week it would be suggested that your mmr has a capped certainty and no longer rises faster than it falls .

if you are wanting to prove yourself you can start by writing properly .
people complain a lot about leavers but its a lack of respect for those who are getting higher to be forced to play 4 mins !
of match with guys that just played 2 o 3 ranked matches so.. aha !
forced to play forced to lose as far a lot players leave and they are right with the best reasons..
if you are going to communicate at least do so properly .
the loss of production in the usa is because of the shutting down of fracking and other sites as the price of oil has dropped below the practical cost to pump out these reserves at the wellhead .

i am curious though is a condensate '' what is referred to as natural gas ?
i 'd encourage you to talk to a real estate agent .
this is one of the biggest buys you 'll probably make in your life and it 's an important and very legal transaction .
a good experienced agent can help you find the best loan programs for your circumstances help you understand each step of the process explain all the things that are difficult to understand right away and negotiate the contract when you find a house you like .
what has pushed you into believing you need separate queue for solo only players and do you even expect dynamic queue to have a decent popularity in 2016 ?
i thought reddit was not a good source of feedback and i am genuenly curious to what your data is on this .
i feel like it 's going to be a cat*astrophe .
those things show that it 's different not how .
and like i said in a medium without motion it tells the reader what 's happening to luffy .
i mean do you honesty feel gear 4 needs more to it ?
it 's very powerful and very versatile and none of the other gears involved having hidden depths .
like post timeskip being able to gear 2 individual limbs and not going small after gear 3 .
like luffy doing gear 4 then shrinking his muscles with strength so the air is under more pressure meaning he is n't bouncing and is stronger .
but that 's not the sort of think op is implying and others are talking about .
awkward moment of today when a woman boards the train and it seems she is pregnant ... no baby badge ...

how do you fit 50 marines on a ship smaller than a destroyer ?
while i prefer painted armies and would like a rule that obligates the player to have all units painted i really liked your answer and will changed my perspective of this .
i still prefer everything painted way more fun to the eyes but this is a game of fun after all .
and for some is like you said they want to play rest is secondary .
hell there are people that just want to paint and not to play !
would it be worth it to just replace the motor ?
also you 're certain that it 's the motor at fault ?
i started keto march 8 2015 with almost the same stats .
it took a couple weeks to get over the carb cravings and get keto adapted .
the first 5 lbs gone in the first week .
15 lbs came off easy in 3 months or so the next 10 lbs over the summer and fall .
i just broke through a scale plateau and finally weighed under 150 lbs .
almost a year later where did the time go ?
and i am still 15 lbs away from 135 lbs but that 's o.k .
seeing your clothes get too large for you and taking body measurements can help you see progress your scale may not show wooshes are real .
xxketo is awesomely supportive and r/1200isplentyketo can help us shorter ladies with ideas for smaller keto meals .
once fat adapted hunger is much less of an issue .
with a long term outlook small slip ups can be overcome i believe you can do this !
best of luck kcko keep calm and keto on !

i have told lots of people and only a few insecure guy friends have teased me about it .
it 's not like i have the most extreme feedism porn on a t-shirt but i do n't miss a chance to mention that big girls can be sexy any time the topic comes up .
with my wife i told her a couple of weeks after we started dating my approach is to constantly remind her that she 's perfect as she is without needing to lose or gain weight to be attractive to me .
i have to be careful because knowing i 'd like to see her eat and get bigger is a really sensitive issue she needs to feel attractive and talking about her changing makes her feel like i 'm not into her the way she is .
so whenever i talk to her overeating or getting bigger i am always careful to remind her that those are only fantasies for me .
it 's not what i really want i just enjoy fantasizing about it .
sometimes she indulges me a little but i make sure she knows she does n't have to .
she 's chubby and super confident about her body .
she eats a ton of healthy food and works out a lot so she is super healthy .
my advice to anyone is just be open about it and try to focus on the cutest most innocent aspects at first .
think about how it affects her and treat her as your equal and your relationship will be healthy and awesome .

a girl i used to be friends with said she needed help moving just a couple of things '' .
my boyfriend and i were out to dinner on a date when we got the text our other friend had bailed on her and we thought it would n't take much time out of our night since she lived near by .
we get there kind of late around 10 pm and not a single thing is in a box hell there were n't even any boxes and then she tells us that she has to be out of there by 6 am because the new tenant is moving in ... we break our backs moving her shit all night long and once everyones car is all loaded up she reveals to us that she does n't have the keys to the new place for a few days and needs somewhere to store all her shit and stay .
so we unpack all her shit into our living room/kitchen/hallways .
all the while she keeps saying shit like it 's fine it wo n't take that long . ''
she never even said thank you or even acknowledged that we were helping her out .
after that night i wrote her a long email telling her how shitty that was and that i did n't want to be her friend any more .
i was on 4.3 until the new nexus came out and the play store was up to date .

nah in the replay that is just a graphical error .
i do n't deny he knew where the player was it was n't me it was more the speed with which he shot him and the fact it was an instant headshot and only one bullet fired .
op 's flair is bowser jr. i think he has a legitimate reason to think about a secondary for the rosalina and villager matchups as they can both easily shut down his entire neutral game and edgeguard him effortlessly making winning via any method other than severely outplaying your opponents extremely difficult .

the question is if hitler was hiding all this time and we tracked him down would we feel the same way about not punishing a msn for something 70 years ago ?
that 's all well and good but was the south african government labelled a terrorist state ?
terrorism is a word states use for people who do the same things they do .
the violence of mandela was obviously justified the violence necessary to sustain apartheid was not .
the word terrorist '' is used to shut down dialogue because terrorism is automatically considered illegitimate .
it 's a conversation-stopper and that 's why i detest it .

yes the the rope is in the system so it will absorb much of the force of the fall .
it also matters that there is far more rope in the system than cordelette and a good deal of rope out compared to the distance of the fall .
also think about it this way quickdraw dogbones are not very dynamic either but the top draw in a lead fall can withstand the force of the fall because that force is greatly reduced by rope stretch .
well it will help the democrats in the idea that it will ramp up communities that have to deal with these immigration issues asian/latino .
even then if this is overturned it can give trump/gop a boost in claiming that even the supreme court states that immigration actions are unconstitutional .
it wo n't give way for immigration reform it will just give way as following the current laws in place .
it will help the democrats and the anti-establishment republicans who are currently leading in polls trump/cruz .

i would n't change a front-heavy vowel system if i wanted that .
most of them are front-heavy and they have way more than 7 vowels and a diphthong .
swedish https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swedish_phonology has the second most skewed vowel inventory i 've ever seen the first most skewed is that language i saw once that seemed to have replaced its o u with √∏ y and only has front and central vowels that i forgot the name of .
however their vowel inventory does n't look very naturalistic to me for other reasons mostly because it has an …™ without having any other lax vowels and it has an a ä without having any other diphthongs usually a ä comes with a…™ .
also i think those can occur in languages without independent  ä …™ since you definitely do n't need the vowels in a diphthong to be able to occur independently of that diphthong .
personally i would add more lax vowels or i would make …™ an allophone of i along with other tense vowels having lax allophones and i would add an a…™ .
you do n't need to have voicing pairs for all the sounds .
look at how many gaps there are in some languages like german https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_german_phonology consonants which does n't natively even have dÕ° í  í but even with them still has a lot of gaps and vietnamese https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vietnamese_phonology initial_consonants .
some languages will even only have one voicing pair like most polynesian languages https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polynesian_languages which seem to have shifted w to v like german ket https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ket_language consonants and mandarin https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_chinese_phonology consonants .

nowadays all medical doctors top sexologists psychiatrists consider masturbation safe and tells that there are no negative affects of masturbation on body or health .
there are a lot of researches going on this topics in top most world universities which says that there are no harmful impact of masturbation on health .
but when we masturbate experience weakness loss of concentration tiredness lost of energy .
this thing had made me a lot of confused .
the scientists gives their researches after proper experiments on individuals then why dont they find that uncountable benefits of not masturbating even some suggest that daily masturbation or even more is good for health ?
i will paste some links in which the scientists and doctors says this same thing
so my question is why cant medical men and community does not believes on negative effects of masturbation even though there are lot of harmful affects of masturbation ?
i am running a new game with morrowloot and all of my needed mlu patches .
so i decided to run into bleak falls barrow just to see the level ranges and inside the first room the 2 bandits there were level 1 .
the guy in the gate room was level 1 .
minlevel for bfb according to tes5edit is 10 with no conflicts .
actually i did have a conflict earlier i had rote loaded after mlu and it was overwriting the min level for mlu .
with the mlu-sic-rote patch loaded up although i did n't look at it to see what it changed .
when i moved mlu down in my load order it resolved the overwrite but that did not change the levels of any of those creatures .
the thing that did change was that bfb was suddenly a lot brighter well lit with almost no shadows .
my save was right outside the entrance to the barrow .
i assume the inside mobs are spawned when i enter for the first time but perhaps i am wrong ?

but i also see the rbg for an extra 20 more and was wondering if it is worth bumping up the price just a tad .
i could live without it but the cosmetic appeal does seem tempting .
there were n't reviews on either of them by redditors and now i 'm finding out they both have kailh switches .
is this a detrimental factor i should be worried about or could i simply overlook it ?
or are there any other steal of a deal mechs i should look into ?
i 'd prefer not to spend more than 80-90 if possible due to my financial situation currently .
we determined that it would be beneficial to have our infant child allergy tested .
we had heard through social media of good results regarding a local gp who provides allergy tests .
the waiting period for other gps to perform allergy testing was considerably longer .
we booked one of these tests some weeks ago and we undertook it today .
i was immediately skeptical once i saw the trays of sealed vials a small electrical device and a seemingly inexplicable yet effective arm strength test procedure .
there was also a verbal questionnaire beforehand which was reflected in the results .
turns out this process was as a part of applied kinesiology https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/applied_kinesiology .
none of this was explained to us before hand not when we booked nor immediately prior to the test .
on closer inspection of the clinic 's website there is this piece of information which i believe was compiled by the gp who performed the test
this technique is considered to be part of complementary and alternative medicine cam and i do not suggest that it is scientifically validated supported by mainstream medicine or that strong reliance should be given to any findings .
do we have any recourse here or is it purely buyer beware ?
the test cost us approximately 4x an average gp consultation fee .
i was under the impression that we would actually be receiving an allergy test .

ever since i discovered that game saves are now filed and separated for each new character you create it 's given me the freedom to create many new builds .
since i want to play on all of them eventually i decided to end my first play-through character so i could move on to the next one .
so i took my first character chose an empty settlement in this case the lighthouse and ended his story by living happily with cait and dogmeat .
after doing this i decided i would do this to all of my characters eventually .
it gives each character their own personality and story in a way .
my goal is to do something different with each character in terms of exploration faction siding etc .
i wo n't have every location discovered and every quest done on a main but rather have them spaced out between multiple characters naturally .
maybe this type of playing will change when console mods come out but for now it 's much more enjoyable than sticking with the same person for hundreds of hours .

i 'm assuming it 's the jasmine and blossom notes .
dkny be delicious edp in my opinion this smells just like you took a bite of an extremely juicy apple !
justin bieber the key edp bear with me here this was my first higher end fragrance purchase and i love it .
middle notes pink jasmine lush water lily and peach nectar
base notes sensual musk precious woods vanilla and hint of raspberry cream
edt currently using this to use it up i love it but i love my others too .
it is a nice fragrance but it 's very light as well and i prefer my fragrances to last more than an hour i think part of this is that it 's an edt when all my others are edp and i expect too much from it .
i think it 'd make a good hair mist .
i love my perfumes but my problem is how expensive they are .
i love them entirely too much and i use them less than i probably should mostly because i ca n't imagine running out of them .
i 've been a lot better about the same thing with my makeup in that i have so many eyeshadows now that i know that no matter what i use up i will always find something to replace it and i will probably never run out of eyeshadow for the rest of my life .
i love love love the indie scene i love the fact that my purchases go to a small business and the customer service has been beyond amazing for every indie purchase i 've made .
i feel like venturing into fragrances and body products will only make me love the indie market even more .
any suggestions for anything that you think might be in my area of interest is well appreciated !
if you 've kept with me this long thank you sooooooooooo much !
i was thinking about suggesting a new weekly/monthly/whatever thread .
i feel like i see a lot of fragrance questions like mine you know recommend a fragrance for me ! ''
i know that in the simple questions and a few other question threads this is asked too so i thought maybe a weekly what 's a good fragrance for me ? ''
maybe people would n't go into as much depth as i went to in this post but you know i 'm a little intense ... haha

i 've just read aanother post on the stairways but i 'm traveling to hawaii in mid august and was wondering if a local was willing to show me and climb the stairway to heaven with me ?

the jigsaw that jgj is working on is titled 'catfish ' and i could n't help but think it is some sort of cryptic message given it 's appearance and certainly it 's title .
here 's a link to the jigsaw for better viewing purposes ...
i apologise if this has already come up on here but i could n't find it if it has .
i used to have them all the time as a kid back in new jersey .
i know this is a random question but i ca n't for the life of me find anywhere that sells them .
does anyone know anywhere in la that sells them ?
yes i can make one myself but it 's not the same .
first off i 'm not really sure this is the correct place to put this but i ca n't think of a different sub it would belong !
anywho as you can probably assume from the title my house is very very cold and drafty .
it 's an old house from around 1912 which i rent with three roommates .
we constantly have the temperature up to 70 75 f but the thermostat almost always reads 65 f or below .
now 65 would n't be terrible if that 's what the actual temperature of the house was .
however it is almost always colder especially the kitchen bathroom and one of my roommates rooms .
we are at a total loss as to how to keep our home warmer sometimes it barely feels better than being outside !
for reference i have a cup that changes color when it is cold and it has been almost constantly the cold '' color even with nothing in it .
we 've bought plastic shrinkwrap window treatments and i have a mini heater in my room but the house is still freezing .
any advice on how to keep our house warmer will be much welcomed especially as a storm approaches and temps keep dipping into teens and below f .
i wish we could just replace the most likely original windows but we rent and will be gone in less than a year .
if i use benzos occasionally will they cause any permanent emotional numbing ?
i have depersonilization and my emotions are already numb so i dont want to continue to numb them .
cg i 'm thinking of 2 numbers between one and one hundred .
first 2 people to guess win the mesprits holding mb 's !
for example if i look at an object through a mirror i 'd see a mirror image of the object .
is there a lens that when worn i 'd see the image of the object itself and not the mirror image when i look at it through the mirror ?
in front of me is a mirror and also a person facing me whose reading a book .
from my view i can see the cover of the book .
if i look at the mirror i can see the contents of the book he is reading but i ca n't read it because it is mirrored .
i put on a special pair of glasses and now i can read the contents of the book by looking at the mirror since the special glasses mirrored the mirror image so what i see now is the real image .
is such special pair of glasses possible does it exist ?
hi i am fairly new to mtb and i have a bike devinci chuck xp http www.devinci.com/bikes/bike_409_scategory_106 that i got as a gift last year that i am wondering if i 'm able to use it without any changes ?

i 'm looking for a good book to read and i loved playing life is strange and wondered if anybody here had any book recommendations that either reminded you of lis or would emotionally 'destroy ' me as much as this game has .
i had asked this a while back in general ask reddit but it did n't get much traction so i suppose i 'll re-pose the question here and make it a little more specific to ask a christian
since you 're a christian i will assume that means that there are lots of gods you don't follow .
you do n't believe that mythic figures such as zeus osiris thor baal or astarte were real entities nor do you believe in those gods that some are still worshipped today such as ganesha or even offshoots '' of the abrahamic god such as allah or the loa of the vodoun .
if my initial assumption is faulty please correct me but i have to imagine that your acceptance of jesus means your rejection of all the other gods and goddesses that some part of humanity have worshipped in the last ten thousand years .
without referring to the things you do believe will you please tell me why you do not believe in say odin or aphrodite or the flying spaghetti monster ?
2015 had been a rough year for me as i found myself waking up late at night with a nagging cough that would keep me up for a few hours before being able to go back to sleep .
i went into the hospital for a week back in december and since then i have been fine up until last night were i was up all night again .
i try to do my vest and neb treatment before bed to see if that helps and i have recently started to do an extra vest treatment .
i was wondering if any of you guys have any other tricks to keeping your coughing down at night ?

you 've seen the technological marvel inner lighting the landscaping that otherworldly feeling of being elsewhere .
you 've seen the marvels of their engineering you know synths .
that the third generation of the institute 's machines look just like human and are indistinguishable from one .
you 've heard the way the scientists treat the synths as machines and as slaves .
if one shows a 'malfunction ' they are reset or even scrapped for parts .
you have been out in the commonwealth you know the synths do their very best to escape the institute and take extreme measures to forget what they lived there .
i 'd like to play a scene where one of the synths has developed a 'malfunction ' and before she 's reset the male scientists are going to enjoy a moment .
another idea could be about the institute having synth sexual slaves just as well as they have cleaning slaves .

i 've been looking for a new mmo to play since about 2010 .
i 've tried ffxiv wow swtor tera skyforge aion swg etc .
it seems like most games out there now are all focused on instant gratification and not focused on playing with others .
i love the fact that xi basically forced you into a party and that due to how much time it took to do anything you would see the same players a bit if they were working towards the same goal .

so i went to the t-mobile store in sq hill to get a new sim card .
they said they would charge 16 for a new sim card .
i remember going to the t-mobile store in dahtahn sept of 2014 and getting a new sim card for free .
is this 16 fee specific to sq hill or is it a new policy for all t-mobile stores ?
i 'm asking because i will need to get another sim card soon .
my phone broke so i got an old phone from a friend which required a different sim .
i just ordered a new phone which will also require a new sim .

this is from a wedding photographer 's contract and i ca n't quite figure out what it means .
i fully admit to being dense when it comes to contract legalese .
they are asking for a retainer upon booking of 40 or 400 whichever is less .
but under the limit of liability section it mentions the following
in the event of act of god or hard drive failure etc ... the liability and responsibility of photographer shall be limited to the return of all payments received for the event s net of any retainer fee received . ''
does that mean the photographer would refund the retainer or not ?
i guess i do n't know what the word net '' means in this case .
i 'm partial to dark comedy and respect those who can pull it off without being exploitative .
christian bale more than earns my respect in his first role as a serious adult thespian a wealthy serial killer who wants to be human just as much as he wants to eat prostitute brains .
this is not a perfect film by any stretch and with anyone other than bale as the lead it could 've been so boring .
but luckily the normally very serious actor sinks his teeth into the ludicrous world of the film like a hungry atm machine and hams the living hell out of it .
the screenplay is kind of awkward nobody talks like real people but that might be the point .
i do enjoy how the film often jumps genres switching rapidly from different kinds of horror to comedy to film noir to the very short action scene at the end .
but i ca n't stress enough how great bale is in this movie .
in a career that entails an oscar and batman i still think this is his best work .

i want to get help on a problem that has been driving me insane .
i have a laptop with both integrated graphics and nvidia gpu .
i have set the .exe files for blackdesert to be run by nvidia gpu through the nvidia control panel .
when running the .exe from desktop my nvidia gpu takes care of the job but i can not login since gamenet launcher is not on .
when running the game through gamenet i can log in but my integrated garphic card is used so i get poor performance ...
everything is set up to run trough the nvidia gpu game.exe gamenet.exe gamenetui.exe ...
but it seems like gamenet launcher is maybe running a different exe ?
it has the same name and the file location is the same as well ...
i can see when the nvidia gpu is used and what program uses it thanks to the notification icon that describes such things .
when running the game via launcher only gamenet.exe uses nvidia gpu but blackdesert .exe does not .
when running the blackdesert .exe only no launcher then it shows the nvidia gpu is used ...
i can not understand how running an exe through the launcher somehow prevents the exe from being run under nvidia gpu .
is there a way to bypass the launcher so i can run bdo.exe and still be able to login ?
i installed the nest when i moved in and for two years it was a problem .
the heat pump never ran and i was burning through propane at a rate of 2,000.00 per year .
the nest was replaced by nest for have a 12 degree temperature variance .
the nest was a problem and i was extremely hesitant to buy an ecobee because of these issues .
i actually thought my heat pump was malfunctioning and needed replaced .
i thought i was going to have to spend a lot of money to get it fixed .
so eventually i said enough is enough and i bought an ecobee3 .
two weeks in i could n't possibly be more impressed with how much better this is .
thank you ecobee for making a product that works .
i started on blizzard with warcraft i and have played every blizz title except wow and diablo iii .
i 've been playing heroes since alpha every mode extensively every day .
i have three heroes accounts and have spent a decent bit of cash on each .
i make a point to regularly discuss the game with players at the top of master league .
i have never shitposted about any blizzard game ... until today .
no balance patch in over two months after massive scaling changes that totally rebalanced every hero in the game .
serious ongoing information lag in notifying users of upcoming new content e.g. we still do n't know when the balance patch is coming .
after all that silence and all those player requests for info a bullshit question mark ! ! !
for empty hype-train purposes instead of actual concrete word on what 's ahead for the game .
announcement of a huge amount of money to be thrown into tournaments with no sign of similar commitment of resources to features actually anticipated by the community like arena clans map editor the fucking emote wheel that got temporarily '' removed a while back remember that guys ?
five of the last six hero releases rexxar artanis cho'gall lunara greymane have all come out severely undertuned and competitively near-unusable .
and medic started pretty crappy and has only come into her own after the scaling changes .
per hotslogs winrates two-thirds of heroes are currently below 50 winrate .
fourteen heroes are below 46 which is equal to the entire roster above 50 winrate .
the game has calcified into a narrow range of op picks with everyone else getting short shrift .
and remember blizz saw this starting to happen after november and has sat on its hands since then .
the recruit-a-friend fiasco where dedicated players who 'd already recruited for blizz got fucked over and had to make smurf accounts in order to grind out the most anticipated mount in the game .
i 'm sure i could come up with more given a few more minutes to steam but i think this is quite enough for starters .
this is not good treatment of your consumer base .
i 've carried a lot of water for blizz over the years .
i 've sold a lot of friends on blizz games and defended a lot of blizz games against what i felt were unjust criticisms .
blizz i am the epitome of the customer you want .
i follow your games for years i spend lots of money on them and i defend them to my friends .
i understand a lot of these things are being pushed by corporate and not the dev team per se love you devs i 'm sure you 're doing the best you can with what you 've got my ire is largely directed elsewhere .
sorry but soon tm does n't cut it with a moba .
we need to know when heroes are coming out and when balance patches are expected .
we understand software development is not an exact science .
let us know what you 've got in the works .
do n't drip-feed us information that we have to beat out of you .
do n't treat your player base like a bunch of fucking chumps .
give older players a chance to buy grind out incentives for newer players .
there 's no excuse for greymane 's w bug not getting caught and fixed before he came out .
there 's no excuse for the myriad of horrendous glitches that affected rexxar upon his initial release .
there 's no way you did n't know lunara was going to be seriously underpowered .
you 've done pretty well on a long string of releases in the past e.g .
sylvanas tlv leoric johanna so i know you can get it together again .
tagging u/trikslyr and u/spyrian because c'mon guys we deserve some answers .
i 'm passionate about the game and really unhappy with some of the decisions made about it lately but you guys are right honey catches more flies than vinegar .
i have a lot of respect for the heroes dev team and i would not want them to feel like i 'm unfairly rancorous .
until today i bought many games with my card on psn store i 'm living on europe romania .
but today when i try to buy a new game without changing any information of my credit card it 's not allowing me to use it it 's weird because how come it worked 3 days ago but now it 's not working ?
and i checked i have plenty money on it .
the error is this the credit card information on file is not valid .
go to function screen settings playstation network account management account information wallet and check the credit card information .
i checked and my credit card it 's ok so what is the problem ?
to whom i need to adress for this problem ?
fujairah computing initiative is displaying the world 's first exascale supercomputer .
the exaflop is considered to be the equivalent to the computing power of the human brain and so this marks a significant achievement in computer science .
the supercomputer has two main immediate uses for human progress .
the first is it will be capable of mapping and modelling the human brain which has the potential to revolutionise the pharmaceutical and medical professions as we can for the first time see how the brain operates and reacts to diseases and new drugs .
the second major application is exascale supercomputers have the computational power to accurately model the entire earth 's weather system for the next two weeks .
this has obvious effects on disaster planning as well as commercial opportunities .
the development has been a partnership between fujairah computing initiative global foundaries the second largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world by revenue and nyu abu dhabi
the supercomputer will be showcased at expo 2020 but will be permanently housed in the specially-built fujairah data haven .

i 'm looking to pay off my mortgage asap and i 'm after a spreadsheet or service that can keep track of my extra repayments variable amounts and somewhat sporadic .
i want to be able to compare to where i 'd be if i had n't made the extra payments so i can see how far ahead i 'm getting in terms of payoff time basically for motivation and money saved .
i have come across a few things but seem quite what i 'm after .
one of the things i 've found is many of them do n't have fortnightly repayments which is what i need .
preferably a spreadsheet or web based thing or even an app .
would n't it be cool to have a short 20 to 30 minute documentary something like this https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=vf_pdzybrje but longer and more indepth with behind-the-scenes footage of the development team team 5 including some of the weekly meetings the people behind the voice acting card designs in progress the making of an expansion/adventure etc ?
i do n't expect them to show everything that happens behind the scenes i.e .
marketing strategies and highly classified future projects but as a fan of the game i 'm really interested in seeing the creation of the audio/visual/card design parts .
then again if they decide to make such a thing it probably would n't come out very soon since they 're probably currently working on content that wo n't come out until the start of next year .
hello i 'm looking for people to play with .
i 'm a 27 yo guy with a mic who is playing the game most evenings on workdays and on free time on weekends .
up to this moment i played only solo i 'm above average player most of the time i top every lobby i play but sometimes it 's not enough if i 'm facing full parties on the enemy team and i 'm the only one on my team making them sweat .
i 'm not hating these situations as i know i 'm getting better when handling those but it would be fun to have someone to join forces and show other parties how the game should be played .
i can speak english or russian languages fluent too .

we have been married for a few years and ever since we started dating we both showed some curiosity about what it might be like to have a 3some but time and reality always got in the way and the fantasy never really came up as a reality .
we used to talk about it in the bedroom and imagine we were being really naughty and for some reason in my head it the third person was always another girl .
tonight we are out for drinks at a bar not too far from home and when i come back from the bathroom i see a look in your eye that i 've only ever seen when we are in the bedroom ...
i know that look well ... darling ... . you know how we talked about ... ''
i 'd love to play this role out from this point on .
i 'm looking for something where instead of finding a girl to play with my lovely innocent wife has found a guy she fancies and maybe we are a bit too tipsy and things go differently to plan ...
maybe the guy is so ridiculously amazing that it ends up with her just having sex with him and me being left out ...
happy to see where things evolve but i love the idea of having the fantasy turned on its head and watching things change in front of me faster than i can keep up with so i totally lose control of the situation .
happy for this to turn into a cheating/cuckolding play or even an interracial play if that 's your thing .
feel free to introduce your own twist to it and i 'm happy to play two roles in the play if needed .
feel free to suggest your own role as well with a cuckolding/cheating theme or let me know what you had in mind .

personally i do n't always carry my surface book in a case especially if i 'm just making a trip out for coffee or something .
but i 'm constantly worrying that something will bump my stylus and knock it off its magnetic track and i 'll lose it .
the surface pro 3 had a pretty good solution .
it came with a little felt loop that securely attached to whatever part of the surface and kept the stylus in place .
well i found out that microsoft actually still sells these and they 're only 5 with free shipping http www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_us/pdp/surface-pen-loop/productid.314886000 .
what 's even better is you do n't need to keep your stylus actually in the loop if you position it correctly .
here 's precisely where i stuck the loop http i.imgur.com/bvn2zqp.png
and here you can see that just the clip of the stylus is inside the loop while the stylus itself is still magnetized to the size of the surface .
http i.imgur.com/rltzubs.png so it slips out easily but it also stays secure a lot better than just using the magnet .
and finally you obviously could just put the stylus inside the loop like god intended .

say on a page of mine i have the following text
a german entrepreneur has built the first ever tech company selling perpetual motion machines . ''
is it tech company '' or german entrepreneur '' or tech company selling perpetual motion machines '' .
im guessing that google considers everything as keywords and then looks at the rest of the content on that page as wellbas the website itself to determine and define concise and exact keywords .
how do i ensure that big g notices '' the keyword that i want to rank for ?
should i just write 100 naturally or should i help search engines ?
do i have to make sure to put in the exact keyword will best electric smoker '' and the best of electric smokers '' both rank for best electric smoker '' ?
will the former example rank easier/better than the latter ?

this morning when i logged in to do my bing pc searches i found that there were none available for me .
the only credits available were the three daily credits from clicking on the links on the main page .
it looks like the bing credit structure has changed once again .
just got the game and booted up the first mission in the tutorial .
they looked like normal looking asteroids and then within a millisecond turned white .
are the comments right when they say that they are supposed to be white because they are icy rocks ?
thanks to anyone who can shed light on this issue .
i could n't find many other people wondering the same thing .
with the new gui in 2.3 coming up do you guys take suggestions and/or patches to improve some interface flaws/imperfections that were present in 2.2 and would probably remain in 2.3 otherwise ?
the dns resolver/forwarder could use small hints that they use unbound/dnsmasq respectively .
unbound 's forwarding mode button lacks a description unlike the other buttons
the quality rrd graphs should swap the vertical labels ms instead of ms since the packet loss is actually on the bottom of the graph
the dhcp lease list should add a button to look up the device 's manufacturer based on the mac on oui e.g .
link port numbers in the firewall logs too e.g .
move the gateway weight '' setting into the gateway group screen .
imho it makes more sense there instead of defining a weight for each gateway on its own
certain menu entries should be reordered or grouped e.g .
system general setup diagnostics halt reboot diagnostics factory reset backup/restore diagnostics ping traceroute dns lookup test port etc. .
while alphabetic ordering is not bad it does n't help if you do n't know exactly how the thing you need is called and where to find it .
grouping would improve this a lot and make finding the correct section faster .
additionally reordering such that entries like general '' are at the top would improve readability too .
the firewall nat port forward rules page lacks the quick toggle button that the firewall rules pages have .
additionally disabling a nat rule does n't appear to be disabling the linked rule which is very very confusing
saving firewall rules but not applying them results in wan configuration has been changed etc '' .
lan the message changes into lan configuration has been changed etc. '' .
state killing on gateway failure the monitoring process will flush states for a gateway that goes down if this box is not checked .
please do n't hide the hostname field in custom '' dynamic dns entries .
some dashboard widgets are updated dynamically whereas others e.g .
instead of staying empty the upper portion on the interface widget of 3g connections could display link status such as link quality
why use openvpn not under vpn in system logs ?
mine started off with an afk 5 minutes in and we lead kills !
first post here although i 've been following for some time .
i 'm so hyped for the rift and i 'm lucky enough to have a march date for my preorder .
the question i have is do i really need to upgrade my gpus ?
i have searched around a lot and not found much with my specific configuration the last post i found was a couple of months old and did n't really answer my question .
if i am just blind then apologies and please point me in the right direction .
my current rig is an ageing i5 2500k 4.3ghz i ca n't get it stable any higher annoyingly i think i lost the chip lottery a z68xp-ud4 from gigabyte which annoyingly has incompatible usb 3.0 ports so i 'm buying a pci-e card and two gtx 680s sli 'd together .
what i 'd like to know is can i run it ?
'it ' being anything designed to run on the cv1 recommended system at launch .
i plan to pick up two pascal flagship cards when they drop whenever that may be and i do n't really want to pick up anything in the interim that i probably would n't need in the future .
i know there is vr sli but from what i 've read that 's not going to be supported in the majority of games at release or more accurately i guess would have to be very specifically coded in by the developers .
what i want to know is how is vr with regular sli these days are there horrible stuttering and latency issues etc .
i 'm pretty sure that nvidia gameworks supports 6xx cards for vr sli but if it is n't going to be supported by the majority of games is it really worth it ?
i get a score of just 11k in the 3dmark fire strike bench which is still plenty to run the majority of modern games at high ultra settings at 1080p 60fps with no aa but on my pretty small 22 '' screen that 's not particuluarly noticeable and i 'll take framerate over pretty visuals any day of the week .
i have no problem lowering settings as needed and disabling aa to get that beautiful minimum 90fps required by the cv1 .
having never used any vr ever i 've never been fortunate enough to have a demo and no one i know even remotely cares about vr and i absolutely can not wait for the ship date .
i 'm just worried i 'll be disappointed for dropping ¬£500 on a piece of kit that i wo n't be able to run until pascal falls out of the sky .
is is amazing to get up each morning with no hang over and not feeling guilty from what i did yesterday.i ca n't believe i 'm starting day 9 .
no tl dr read this whole thing and sorry in advance for any formatting errors .
before you start reading this please understand that this was created in a rush and may contain errors .
i do not claim that this is a perfect document but i do think it is reasonably accurate and worth reading through .
feel free to comb through the claims of this events list and provide your input .
it should come as no surprise that this is probably incomplete and probably a small bit biased as with many things ! .
my goal in posting this is to educate fellow detroiters/suburbians about the issues going on with dps and give some insight into why the teachers are so angry .
it is n't just about the horrible building conditions that the news/mayor is focusing on .
for information on me i am a teacher at cass technical high school and a phd student at wayne state university i have also attended the union meetings regarding these sick outs and other issues .
my position on this sick-out issue is not rock solid like some of the other people you may see demonstrating on the street and at the auto show today .
in fact i did argue passionately against the sick out today although i argued for cass tech 's only other sick out .
however i fully understand almost everyone 's complaints and their desire to keep this issue relevant to the public .
so to help all my friends here at r/detroit i bring you this list of events to help put this in context .
1994 plan a ‚Äì school funding based on a per-pupil allocation of 7296 .
school board spends 55-60 of state per-pupil allocations on classroom instruction .
voters pass 1.5b bond for new construction and renovations .
1997 ‚Äì an audit by an independent firm concluded that dps had significant problems with governance administration management finance operations students scoring poorly on achievement tests dps suffers from high dropout rates .
engler signed into law public act 10 board members appointment of school reform board by mayor in certain school districts and provide for chief executive officer of school district senator d. degrow
it allowed mayer archer to appoint a 6-person reform board and a 7th person being the state superintendent of public instruction .
when the state took over dps had a nearly 100m positive fund balance increasing enrollment and mid-range academic scores .
1.2b of the 1.5b remained from the bond passed in 1994 .
2002 ‚Äì dps spends 24.1m to move into the fisher building .
3 years into the state takeover dps reports a 48.7m deficit .
2004 ‚Äì the citizens of detroit vote to return power of the schools to the elected school board .
kenneth burnley announces a projected 200m deficit no action was brought against him or his plan .
governor granholm approves a 210m loan to be paid back in the amount of 310m over 15 years to cover the deficit .
2005 ‚Äì dps halts teachers ' salaries and step increases .
their main argument for this was that this would prevent them from reducing salaries and wages any further in light of the large deficit .
2006 ‚Äì a new board was elected and put in place .
at this time the 100m surplus budget has fallen to a 200m deficit and 27 schools closed .
not being able to in a 3-year period lead to the state to another state takeover .
dps reinstated staff steps but asks teachers to loan them 5 days to be paid back at a later date in efforts to prevent salary reductions and to help with operation costs .
the bond had then been earmarked for projects under state management .
2009 ‚Äì robert bobb appointed as the 1st emergency manager of dps by granholm .
the board foundation a large organization promoting school choice and privatization of the education system in this country pays bobb a 145k salary in addition to his 280k government salary .
bobb closes additional schools many being the newly renovated ones .
bobb spends 40m on out of state consulting expenditures after firing the then current dps staff .
bobb increases the number of district assistant superintendents from 3 to 10 at a 1m expenditure .
bobb hires 4 out of state vendors to manage 17 dps high schools that remained under dps control to the tune of 20m .
bobb takes out 3 separate loans to cover short falls at an expense of 41.8m in interest .
tip was initiated where dps borrowed 500 each month to reduce payroll taxes and presumably prevent salary reductions .
the state instituted a 3 health care trust to establish a future health care expense fund which may or may not existed at retirement .
all of which received these funds back except for the educators in the state .
bobb reports that the deficit is now at 327m .
2011 ‚Äì tip ends to the tune of 9,000 per teacher to be returned at the separation from service with the district .
dps and bobb instituted a 10 pay cut across the board taking 9 this year .
roy roberts is appointed as the 2nd em of dps by snyder ‚Äì promising he would be the last .
2012 ‚Äì the education achievement authority was introduced instituted by snyder with 15 schools and 11,000 dps students .
eaa 's purpose was to turn around detroit 's 15 worst performing schools .
dps took the additional 1 of the 10 pay reduction this year .
2013 ‚Äì jack martin is appointed as the 3rd em of dps by snyder .
2014 ‚Äì jack martin proposes an additional 10 pay cut to teacher 's salaries .
teachers will also have to pay 13.1m in healthcare increasing payments to nearly an additional 100/mo .
2015 ‚Äì darnell earley the guy with strong ties to the flint water problem appointed as the 4th em of dps by snyder .
1,100 of the 7,000 per pupil allocation now goes to debt repayment .
early proposes an additional 10 wage cut for teachers eliminating more teaching positions and the closure of additional schools .
due to heavy opposition once again this plan is rejected .
2016 ‚Äì dps currently operates with a combined 3.5b operations deficit and long term debt .
around 3,000 of the 7,300 per pupil allocation is used for debt repayment
less than 40 of the per pupil allocation is used for classroom instruction and dps operations .
currently the debt payment is 26m designed to chip away at the 121m owe for current cash flow issues with an additional 139.8m owed for prior operating expenses .
debt payment to increase to 53m to cover the mounting 515m deficit .
with the insolvency debt the taxpayers are on the hook for 1.5b through bankruptcy .
the main issue here that i 'm hoping comes through is the exploding debt that has been accrued during the watch of the state appointed boards/emergency managers .
i absolutely assure you this is the biggest issue facing dps right now and i absolutely confirm to you this is the main focus of the teacher sick outs .
the debt is ballooning and the people of detroit had almost no electoral representation during this .
this is where most of the anger of the teachers and community is coming from .
from our perspective the state took over the school board/finances and over the last 13/17 years they 've completely bankrupted us without us having any impactful input whatsoever .
to me it is very similar to telling your kid that you 're taking over the finances of your neighbor 's house because most people on the street think your neighbor is handling themselves extremely poorly and everyone does n't want them to tank the value of the entire street/neighborhood .
yet while you 've been in charge of their finances which were not a disaster at the start of your takeover you 've run your neighbor into crippling debt where now about 40 of their income has to go to interest payments to debt that you 've racked up on their behalf without them having any say in it .
then when the neighbor is protesting the situation you try and claim it is n't your fault .
perhaps this allegory is good but incomplete but i hope it gives you the picture of where dps employees are emotionally and why this may seem like it is exploding all of a sudden .
in fact this has been a very long journey to where we 're at .
if the city wants to really start attracting businesses to come back to detroit in my opinion the best thing the city could do is get the schools in order .
if you 're looking at a job in another part of the country for a hot new company but want to start a family the first thing you 're going to ask is how 're the schools ? '' .
if the answer to that question is not good at all but you can commute anywhere between 25 mins-1 hour one-way depending on where you can afford/want to live '' that may be a hindrance upon you deciding to move to detroit .
i 've taught in two school districts that get slightly less money per pupil than detroit public schools yet are absolutely fabulous school districts that run effectively and are accommodating to the needs of their populations .
detroit public schools can be an outstanding school district with the revenue it currently receives .
however we 're crippled under this debt and you see the results .
the purpose of the sickouts is to call attention to this debt and thus it becomes the biggest demand of the teachers to have the state immediately resolve this issue so we can go back to teaching like it should be done .
i 'll end it here even though there is a great deal more to discuss .
i just wanted to get this information out to my friends here .
the previous debates have been really healthy ones and i encourage all of you to keep talking about this .
talk about it here on r/detroit and more importantly talk about it with your friends and neighbors .
i am looking for a cpu or apu that matches the fm2 socket .

it 's really interesting to me that this is how our expectations of games have changed .

we have to try irregardless of how mad the world gets to try and take up an issue to its logical conclusion doing otherwise would be to give up and live in a bubble .
taking an issue to the logical conclusion does not justify politicization of non-existent or clubbing together other issues .
living in a bubble that is exactly the problem .
that is the reason why none of the problems get to a logical conclusion ... cause every one just wants to see through their own cause protect their own bubble .
no one actually wants to get their hands dirty and work on a solution .
the fact that it has blown up so much just compounds to the problem ... so many more bubbles ...
the idea of debate is not what you see in that show its a tamasha and that 's how its presented and shown nothing more or less going on there .
i was referring to the times now debate to show you political opportunism at work .
and that is what reduces it to a tamasha .
no one will spoon feed you a reasoned argument you would have to seek it out in any case not just this one .
this is very true but i was responding to op 's statement about student suicide being ignored ... and my answer to it is unless there is a political opportunity in it no one is bothered about anyone dying .
i 'm having a comparable experience with an infj .
if she does n't want to be straight with you there 's nothing you can do about that .
if you 've given her reasonable opportunity to get her shit straight then the ball 's in your court you have to decide if you want to put up with what she 's dealing out or if it might just be best to cut your losses pack up and go home .
it 's hard but if she does n't want to play ball it might just be best to move on .
compromising your dignity trying to save '' a friendship will only ever hurt you in the long run .
if a person constantly leaves you feeling like you 're at a loss that 's a huge red flag that they 're a toxic presence in your life .
yea i have no idea but i asked him about 3 times are you sure these are n't similar or look written by the same person '' and he assured me they were pretty different .
i did n't ask too much about how he did it but i would imagine it 's what you said he probably took two different stances on the argument and wrote a paper for each .
where he got the time i do not know at all lol

i was going through some legacy code today that was basically checking if some pdf files are present in a folder copying them in bulk saving status to the database and sending summary email .
not only in one class single responsibility principle anyone ?
what 's even more terrible that was a base class .

you realize the idea of a toxic player was created by the community itself ?
also the report system is harder to abuse because it actually checks for if the report is legit and in the case it punishes someone who did n't do anything wrong riot is willing to reverse the decision after checking for themselves ... not to mention a perma-ban already get reviewed by a person at riot .
so yeah you can get fringe cases where someone has a string of bad games gets reported and perma banned for intentional feeding but that 's rather rare .
9 times out of 10 the person actually deserved the ban and either ca n't see it themselves even with the report card or try to hide it and cry to the community .

the life they imagine the average woman lives is hilarious to me .
they ca n't fathom that women are normal people like them who go to work and come home and do their laundry and cook dinner and watch tv maybe go out for drinks or a movie on the weekends .
no to them every woman is a jet-setting princess wannabe with a past full of foreign lovers who gets free drinks from every bartender and has men offering her money and prizes just for existing who only wants a boyfriend so she 'll have someone to pay for her jewelry and vacations .
you 're forgetting how hard it is to make it to the major leagues in baseball .

one is for the minors and pays very little and one is for the majors .
the guys in the minors make a decent living but it 's not enough to be mostly set after they retire possibly with injuries .
i think changing tags is good to do as your channel grows .

once again it can help with your continuity and help your style but if you have a lot of videos it might be a little overwhelming i have over 1,000 videos so i 'm crying internally thinking about thumbnails .

today 's black canary appreciation day on twitter and i stumbled on this picture featuring some of the more notable quotes from laurel .
my personal favorite is the second to last i know that the world is n't fair .
i know that it 's a terrible place where people deserve to get punished and they do n't . ''
imo this marked the time when laurel becomes fully drawn to vigilantism and showed that her next step was putting on the black canary mantle .
despite the poor execution and writing in general that laurel receives as well as her more prominent negative traits i do believe her road towards becoming black canary was a really good and believable story she put on the mantle not because it 's fun or because she was forced to but because she wanted to continue doing bringing the bad guys to justice and protect people just as she did as a lawyer but was held back due to corruption .
i also love how determined they made her character be a character trait i always love seeing in an underdog .
this one time my siblings and i and some of our friends made a super long multi-room tent over our clothes lines and hung out in them all day and then spent the night in there too .

and also a lot of those friends grew up to be total trash and are no longer our friends .

on rare occassions my wife who is stunning goes through the exact same thing and our exchange be it irl or text is pretty much the same as the one you linked but like i said it is only for our consumption .
my wife is a stay at home mother and our division of labour is divided between typical blue and pink jobs .
i do n't do the cleaning and she does n't do the home maintenance .
if i suddenly started vacuuming my wife would not see it as a spontaneous act of helping her out i would be sending her a message that 's she 's incompetent i might as well call her lazy and set up the bed in the guest room while i 'm at it .

making an arrow requires multiple skilled tradesman to produce 1 arrow and your quantities are limited to the number of them you have on hand
you 're painting a strange picture of multiple people laboring together to produce a single arrow at a time .
in fact a single archer even working alone at fletchery could resupply himself with ammunition .
frequently they did n't even have to bother and you know why ?
because the battlefield would be littered with re-useable arrows everywhere .
but if they needed to they could make arrows while on campaign in the woods .
anyone can make shot and gunpowder yeah anyone who 's been taught how to do that .
the skill level is not that different from fletchery except with regard to making gunpowder which is much more difficult and labor and material intensive .
but point in fact you are n't going to have just anyone '' making replacement shot and gunpowder and in the woods you are n't going to have anyone making them period .
your quantities are limited to the number of them you have on hand
your quantities of musket ammunition aren't limited to the number of them you have on hand ?

it 's completely random where the puddles will form during each monsoon .
the thing about the puddles is that they all form at once during the first few bursts of rain and continue to spread during the following rain days .
so if you sandbag all the puddles around your island before they spread you 're good for the rest of the season because they do n't spawn anymore .
your only concern after this is the water that spreads from the shore which sandbags do properly barricade unlike puddles .
since there were a few powergaming is the devil '' posts i 'm going to counter from the other side .
i make optimized characters and i enjoy it immensely .
i enjoy testing new builds i enjoy playing weird combinations that just happen to work well together and i love roleplaying .
i am a huge roleplayer its why i play dnd and powergaming does n't prevent me from rping .
have your character be the best at what you want it to be .
sometimes they are n't even the best '' character just super optimized to do something unique i have a friend who has a dwarf who dual wields shields .
his ac is out of this world and after my character cast permanency enlarge he basically stands in the front taking all the damage while we blast the enemies from behind him .
some of the builds are ridiculous some of the builds are super effective other builds are super effective when they are effective but shitty when they are n't i made a lvl 19 ranger for a campaign of hunting down demogorgon a major demon .
everything on that character is specific for demon hunting .
i think he has a 60 to hit ce demons and 30 against anything else and others are just silly and weird .
power-gamers do n't necessarily ignore backstory nor roleplaying but its secondary to character creation .
just because i 'm roleplaying a sneaky rogue does n't mean i have to choose the relatively useless feat of deceitful . ''
3.5e or pathfinder rules i 'll just put the skill points into disguise and forgery and choose something useful to have like weapon finesse . ''
a powergamer does n't want to break the game .
that 's the fun of it following the rules .
some of the people here have written complaints about munchkins . ''
munchkin is where they are trying to break the rules using house rules or 3rd party rules such as creating half x half y races where they chose the best of both worlds .
they often choose ridiculously powerful gear have goals like become a lycanthropic lich '' or other stupid shit .
powergamers do n't necessarily want nor need to be the center of attention .
it 's a stereotype and while sometimes true not always .
just like there are paladins who are obnoxious and refuse to let any non lg players do anything or cn players who chose that alignment just so they can roleplay whatever i feel like that day '' there are bad powergamers ... but there are many more good ones then bad ones .
the only time a powergamer will really highlight the game is when they are the only optimized character and everyone else built shitty characters .
great you created a bard with 10 charisma and 18 constitution .
so your bard abilities are n't really helpful and you still do n't that much hp . ''
again just because you are a roleplayer '' does n't mean you have to make a shitty character .
these were n't your run-of-the-mill skin heads they were in fact full on douche bags .
also does n't know skin heads are like douche bags but way worse .
i usually hate the phrase is everything '' but really your flair is everything .
hey avarem i 'm really late to the party but i would like it if you could find some time to respond to this question of mine .
on the topic of club world expansion do you foresee a possibility of there being a way to sell items via benches ?
it would be nice to see players creating their own shops within a club even if it was limited to something like a display case that advertises an item for sell by a player .
i have posted a topic on the trove forums awhile back trying to start a discussion about this .
if you do n't mind i would like to share it with you .
non-market economic systems have a pretty horrific record of adequately feeding their populations and overfishing occurred in certain areas in ancient pre-capitalist societies .
collectivizing the ocean '' or whatever would not solve the overfishing problem too many people need to eat .
this is the same reason all the top competitive eaters are skinny .
the one thing that turned me off of tesla was n't the car it was the fan base .
this is such a bullshit response that 's way too common in this sub .
this sub will convince you that nothing matters '' do n't major in minors ! ''
if you do n't have an answer to the question it 's best not respond .
how does op know you even know if you know what you 're talking about ?
my mb and i chat daily when it 's not db home first but we also touch base about stuff through email so after a week of her being 5-20 minutes late in one of the emails i just let her know that i had an appointment on x date 40 minutes after i finish work and would i be able to get out of there by my end time .
i reminded her of it the start of that week and it was brought up the day off and she ended up driving me to the metro to make sure i got there on time .
but yeah definitely had to bring it up or else i probably would not have made it .
if you have the dates of future appointments/meetings i would maybe send them off in an email ?
if she 's organized enough maybe she can jot that down in her agenda and know she needs to make it home on time .
also people are mentioning your pay.. how are you paid ?
the first week i started she tallied how do you spell that ?
up my hours and if i was there until 5:05 she wrote that so that 's how we do it now .
it helps knowing that i 'll at least see that money even if i 'd rather be at home .
could you do something like that so it 's at least a bit more fair to you when she 's late ?
none of the subnets overlap does proxy-arp still apply ?
when he gets more confidence he is going g to be a beast .
i had a girl feel and see them she also smilled and said enjoy your day .
you can develop a high tolerance to alcohol and then basically reset yourself .
what i mean is that you drink so much that when you take your first sip or finish your first drink you brain associates that with the feeling of being really drunk .
you know i was in the same boat regarding joker for the longest time .
excluding the tattoos he seems like a manic version that has n't been on film yet .
i 'm ready to see leto 's take on him
you 've got the ratings wrong in the title btw .
the 83 is first if 84 is sif 85 is tif .
the reason why the price of the first if is greater than the sif is because the the first if was a totw1 player so it 's a lot rarer card low supply leads to slightly higher price even if there are better options available in terms of ratings .
the instrumental version is called the royal salute ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉŸä as-salƒÅm al-malakiyy which is also the name of the ceremony in which it is played to salute senior members of the royal family as well as diplomatic figures .
3 top 5 losses in the last two days and smu is in a fight right now .
if it selected all sorts of random opponents '' i should have at least encountered diamonds once or twice .
most of my matchups were with silver or gold a couple platinum .
only after the 10 games does your ranking change based solely on wins/losses .
i 'm sorry you were hurt as a child .
edit lmao dude realized he had no idea what he was talking about so he deleted his comments
it 's in the menu screen when you hit esc key .
it is in the stats tab between back to game and options above exit .
it brings up a survival summary click detailed view and it will list a ridiculous number of statistics .
will it be possible to make say ardent-aligned vennen or underworld-aligned elves ?
or does the choice of your champion 's race determine their allegiance ?
this will be my first time at bonnaroo but my fifth time seeing the dead .

of course i was tempted to continue but a lot of the other quests early on certainly make the game much easier should you choose to complete them and there are some other diversions from the coc which also do so .
ergo when i found that quest line i followed it expecting that it would soon return me to the coc with some boon that might help with the end game .

ffxiv is p2p and we still have rmts there but not much since the first expansion came out .
so i 'm pretty sure this game will also have lots of rmt .
i do n't see how looking to the right hand side and reading the few things that shows how this community runs is too much to ask .
it 's not even 500 words less than half a page .
i also have to disagree most answers to people 's questions are on the sidebar .
they are tools that let you make informed decisions .
more often than not these questions are people reconfirming what the sidebar has already told them not legitimate questions '' .
one does not gain rights for people by agreeing with their oppressors that only some of those folks deserve equal rights .
this has never been about incremental advancement it has more to do with hrc leadership thinking less white less cis folks are icky too .
it has to do with seeking the approval of the oppressors .
before i start this post there could be spoilers so read with caution and i 'm not a doctor so half of the stuff i say could be wrong or right all right now the disclaimer part is over let 's actually get to the good part of this post started oh and before i continue this is purely my opinion if you see any posts about the mental state of the club check it out !
yuki takeya oh great i 'm starting off with the most mentally messed up one of the club yuki most likely has split-personalities since i think rii or kurumi mentioned it at one point in the manga she also possibly could have schizophrenia schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal social behavior in severe cases patients may see or hear things that are n't real sounds familiar doe n't it ?
there are other symptoms of schizophrenia but these are the main symptoms in recent chapters yuki 's mental state seems to be getting better .
kurumi ebisuzawa kurumi most likely has ptsd since she has nightmares about killing her senpai or she could just have night terrors i ca n't really say a lot about her mental state since they do n't really explore it a whole lot in the anime or manga but in recent chapters she seems a bit more seldom so she could be developing depression i could be wrong about that .
miki naoki miki or mii-kun most likely has depression it does say she has depression on the gakkou gurashi wiki she also could have devopled mild ptsd after kei left in recent chapters her mental state seems to be getting better like kurumi we do n't know much about what 's going on in her mind .
yuuri wakasa oh boy were do i start on this one yuuri started to go off the deep end kind off recently but after kurumi nearly turned into a zombie yurri probably started to develop severe anxiety and depression she also probably develop ptsd as well but since she went bat shit crazy recently who know 's what 's wrong with her at this point .
now it seems like she could end up like yuki since there are so many theories going on that her sister could be an illusion .
again like i said at the beginning of this post this is purely my opinion and if you see any other theory 's about the club 's mental state check out !
like being able to chose where i 'm from suburb or city maybe even be international .
college was fun and i would love to continue it .
but i also want more colleges or at least bigger ones .
chose family color i 'm not black ... and i know some games force blacks to be white and it 's a gaming problem .
a free mode career no storyline and no caps .
this where if you had a bad day and you want to be overall 99 immediately .
just overall 99 immediately and just play game without stress
like they even say some shit like sirius is carrying a gun a metal wand muggles use to kill eachother '' .
edit it seems the general consensus is that it is extremely difficult ng and on
i only went through it on ng and it was a lot easier than i expected.. ca n't wait for ng !
i 've seen many people say that it was one of the weakest powers .
also i switched to a quantum controller any good builds ?
just trying to find a solid build that is reputable .
instead of articles i have a system of absolutive markers and verbal affixes .
a '' is the absolutive marker for feminine nouns .
the verb to be is not used in the present indicative except for periphrasis .
from mi verbal affix for first person singular la contracted to l accusative affix for feminine third person singular ama non conjugated or 3rd person singular of the verb amali '' .
nouns lose their absolutive markers when they get affixes attached .
so if i do n't drop tonic personal pronouns the sentence i love the girl '' is milama ec√¥ nina .
literally they-them feminine-be read feminine plural participle my-poems europe-by .
the word for poem comes from poli flower and tlaht√¥la word .
i 'm already hearing the dodgers might trade ethier this year ... . again .
i think it would be down right stupid to trade him .
he 's as solid and reliable as it gets .
he 's been the only consistent after years if uncertainty .
if we have to get rid of one of my vote is crawford or svs only so he can start everyday .
the outfield to win imo is ethier puig and pederson .
i then proceed to win 7 out of 10 placement games and get placed in silver 4 ?
i have been able to handle the cravings however i am feeling constantly tired .
the last three nights i have come home from work and ended up falling asleep for three hours .
jump over saws and spinies in a fast paced traditional level .
how much did it cost you for the hardware and ongoing software subscription ?
his winrate is pretty solid and hes decently fun to play.. http champion.gg/champion/shen check this link for winrate ect .
would they still get the stangler 's effect if the cards never reach the graveyard ?
a recent chapter mentioned meng hao could look the way he does now for the rest of his lifetime .
does anyone know what age he is or how he is supposed to look ?
i thought it was mid-late 20s but i might be super wrong .
i tell them no feminism is 100 fraud lies disinformation the wage gap 1 in 4 male privilege the patriarchy and hate propaganda used to obtain billions in funding from the government and banking institutions to push for ever more legislation that strips men of even more of their basic human rights everyday and give women god like legal power over men and children which they already have but want more and more vawa consent laws kangaroo courts in colleges punitive and insane child support laws denying custody to fathers and on and on .
and feminists themselves are just about the most incredibly stupid ignorant and insane and most horrendous excuses for human beings imaginable .
and of course eventually feminists want to make rape laws to where any and all accusers are automatically believed and men automatically sentenced to prison no trial no attorney no defense no questions asked .
that 's what they want and at this rate i have no doubt they 'll eventually get it if men do n't start pulling their heads out of their asses and start caring about their own rights and their own fucking lives .
meanwhile the mra is about actually fighting for basic human rights that men do not have no reproductive rights no rights to their children no rights to due process in kangaroo false accusation of rape courts in colleges passed over in hiring by less qualified women because of affirmative action no programs at all for men no rights to speak freely or to even voice any complaints without being scarlet lettered fired and even thrown in jail horrendous alimony laws paternity fraud boys deliberately graded down by spiteful male hating female teachers and on and on and on and on and on and on .
feminists have to find petty insignificant 'gripes ' to complain about just to try to make themselves even relevant at all feminism is a joke .
also the mra is filled with some of the best people there are men .
the people inventing building maintaining and repairing the entire freaking world .
the mra gets no funding from the government or from anyone else except personal contributions and while feminism is 100 complete fraud and based on lies the mra is about exposing that very fraud and misinformation that feminism spews .
and is on a constant quest to expose the truth .
feminism is pure evil and hate while the mra is about fighting for basic human rights women have stripped from us with hate-filled laws and legislation and about exposing the truth .
first of all i would like to start by saying that the full release is awesome have n't yet finished it but ca n't wait to die trying .
i 'm playing on a mac and in window mode and it seems that the game window will only stay in front of all others open .
i dont play anymore but i went on a nostalgia trip today how do i find the actual age of my account ?
i found i can ask hans and do some math but my account is older than 10 years and therefore do n't get the countdown or whatever .
taking my dad and mom is tagging along with us to cooperstown and a yankee game nyc .
we 're gon na be flying in all the way from texas .
the trick is finding the cheapest and most efficient way to get to/from cooperstown and nyc and i was wondering if anybody here could help me with that !
i was reading a series that i kept open a few days .
came back to see it crashed and did n't load back up so i need help finding it .
the rough details i remember was that it was a manga about knights and evil monsters .
the protagonist was very poor and lived with his mother .
he was training and i forget some details but he eventually trains with one of the great knights that ends up being his father spoiler .
he ends up releasing the latent abilities of the hero which turns his eyes golden .
innate qi which is the highest in generations and he can be one of the strongest knights ever .
the trainer gives him this special urn that has the ability to make monsters target him .
those are all the details i can remember but it seemed like it could have been a light novel .
the reason korean guys are popular to jap girls is because japs are flamboyant .
it 's the grass is always greener on the other side '' .
also korean has the image as the original japanese '' their root .
as for me i do n't want jap girls especially when wronged personally .
even if i do n't want jap girls just because she is a jap just because i hate japan that is a legitimate reason .
also aside from how that decision is rightfully up to my choice only anyway it is not even racism .
ethnic hatred is not racism when validly reasoned it is a rightful racism even if wrongly using that word .
as for the original japanese '' image it 's an existing image being perceived .
there are some differences in personalities between korean japanese .
for example south korean personality tends to be more direct powerful similar to italian .
japanese personality tends to divide the personality to show '' the real personality '' .
deception presentation is a part of their social culture .
korean lacks such smart fawning '' which makes it more attractive to japanese girls if fed up with such fake connections '' .
as for faces some south koreans look caucasoid because of the uralic blood like khalkhas caucasian blood indian blood arab blood .
hence koreans look better than japanese or chinese in racial traits .
also japanese has pygmy blood mixed in them so that grimy crammed face is exotic repulsive to korean although such grimy exotic look seems to be acceptable to japanese .
it 's a part of the korean gene pool .
also it is the standard for beauty whether admitted or not .
some foods like bulkogi real one flat no juice kalbi work on most people .
some foods like kimchi japanese fermented beans are acquired tastes that are repulsive exotic to most people .
grimy exotic look is like that if talking only about the face while there are all those other factors anyway .
japanese has acquired the taste for such exotic flavor grimy exotic face but it can be very abrasive to koreans .
let 's give an example of what i mean by grimy exotic look .
i do n't know anything about them including how famous they are .
suzuki airi is the type of face that works on korean .
yoshida lena is the type of face that does n't really work .
i do n't want to bother googling japanese celebrities forever .
some people are more obvious some people are less obvious .
i am just giving an idea what i mean by grimy exotic look '' .
i 've been trying to remember where the kobe https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=7tt19yycew8 sound effect came from as i remember hearing it years ago anyone have any idea ?
we win against teams better than us in the standings .
if we can get into the playoffs in the last seed we will be facing teams better than us throughout the playoffs thus pushing us into the stanley cup finals .
we could face the worst seed in the west at which point things are up in the air .
you kicked my ass for about a half hour in soldiers rest and i 'll have you know i only left because there were something i needed to go pick up .
i just pulled a second lushen/malaka from my toa scrolls so i 'd like to start doing more pvp .
atm i 'm capping out around 1600 points so i was lookin for some advice on what you guys would use for offense and defense .
i was starting to have feelings for a guy and we had been on a date or two then i was in his room and we were kissing .
long story short a piece of my pad came out the back of my pants while we were kissing bc we were moving so much and although i quickly grabbed it he still saw it and i did n't know what to say so we gave a few little kisses and i was out of there .
do i have a chance at recovering or should i change my name
i do n't swear at my child but i swear about what she does .
one thing that pisses me off is when she comes back home with leftovers and throws it away .
i tell her if she 's going to throw food away do it at school because when i see her throwing it away at home i just feel like she 's throwing away money .
so she comes home and she threw away a good portion of a subway sub from last night that was packed in her lunch sidenote i separated the toppings and there was no sauce so it was n't soggy ! !
you 're fucking wasting food ... if you 're not going to eat your fucking food chuck it at your fucking school do n't fucking bring it back here you know i hate seeing that fucking shit it 's so fucking wasteful ... .etc etc .
she ran to her room slammed the door threw some things around ... bleh .
basically she gets quite upset when i start swearing .
i think she sees how unclassy it looks and it reminds her of rage mom so i mean i think that 's good !
but am i traumatizing her by swearing when i 'm mad ?
i 'm curious to hear from people who have grown up around people who swear when they are mad but were otherwise not abusive i do n't call her names i do n't hit her..i 'm actually quite affectionate and we have a good relationship but my temper/temper swearing scares her a little i think..and i break stuff too when i 'm mad sometimes..but that has n't happened in awhile
hey all a good friend of mine is organizing a local game day and is looking for volunteer gm 's .
also looking to get the word out for players who might be interested .
see the link here for information about the game day date/time/location as well as to complete the gm application .
i now have a total level of 2595 split among all my skills .
i have quite a few pokemon built up from breeding and i would love to trade most of them .
please feel free to ask any questions you may have .
all of these pokemon are legit and breed by me .
genders do vary so if it matters please ask me about it .
eevee anticiption modest dream ball perfects are male only females are 4-5iv mixed
as i said most of them have 3-4 egg moves so do n't hesitate to ask about them .
in exchange i am wanting to get 5iv competitive pokemon in matching/cool balls .
if you do n't have any of those but still want to offer something please go right ahead .
when you play a card theres a chance that alternate card art will show .
this is purely visual and will be like an easter egg of sorts .
i think that would be really cool and freshen up the game .
so i started off with a helix syn as my first aneros and hated it with passion .
no matter what i did all it resulted in was a sharp pain .
i figured since i enjoy plug and dildos i would have a better time with it due to its size .
and i was right as soon as i put it in it was as comfortable as could be .
i just dont think my anatomy is compatible with aneros toys .
while the progasm is comfortable to the point where it will feel like its not even there at all lies the issues .
it feels kinda nice when initially sliding it in but after its in i have zero sensations at all .
to the point where if im sitting there not touching myself i will eventually go soft and thats it and nothing will happen and eventually the lube starts drying and removal becomes uncomfortable .
i have to pull the toy out by 1/3rd or so and push firmly forward with the tip of it .
i found a spot that i can only assume is my prostate .
grinding against that spot gives the slight sensation of needing to urinate in the tip of my member .
continuously working this spot just ends up with drops of semen leaking out but no real sensation other than the urination feeling .
i would have kept going longer but i again run into the lube drying and not long after that really cramped hands/wrists .
letting it go and naturally settle into place leaves me again with the no sensations at all .
i think it just pulls into me too deep .
im always reading these storys and seeing these videos of hands free orgasms and how the prostate is just the best feeling thing in the world and touching it causes uncontrollable waves of pleasure and what not .
yet i cant even come close to any of it outside of imagination .
a part of me thinks its just some huge bs scam .
still cant even find anything even with my finger .
i keep being told that i should be able to feel some sort of spongy walnut shaped spot inside me but it all just feels like smooth wall .
anyways point being i just dont think aneros is something that can work for me .
i just dont think my anatomy is built for it no matter how much i wish or try .

and i have been saving for a new car right now i have around 8k saved up .
my beater just died 17 y/o car with 3.5k need in repairs .
so i was thinking about get the car soonish .
my question now is if i can afford a 23k car ?
i was looking at 15k loans at either 1.5 with 36 months or 1.9 on a 60 month .
i was thinking about taking the longer loan and paying double payments just so i have the flexibility if i need to pay less some months .
assume that each character 's sword has the same effect on the other character as a regular sword would have on a regular human .
err ... by sword fight i guess i meant a straight-up fight with both characters happening to receive their swords .
i have had a history for at least the past 8 years when i first started to notice that spirits choose to outright speak to me in dreams as if i am carrying on a real conversation .
but when it comes to me being awake i only get images or thoughts that are not my own so to speak .
mental illness runs in my family so how do i trust that these are spirits talking to me and not insanity creeping in ?
is there a reason why one very powerful and bright spirit chooses to talk to me the most ?
it is almost always her that i talk to and i can always tell that it is her .
i have so many questions regarding this solely because the other day she chose to show me some things and they dumbfounded me as it was an entirely new experience for me .
it was a wave of feelings that came over me that was not my own and it was not in a dream world .
so since then i have been thinking about it and wondering these questions .
using a throwaway so the people i share this with ca n't stalk the rest of my posts
i find myself constantly surrounded by such ignorance and lack of respect that i often stop and try to figure out how it can be so common in people adults usually some generations ahead of me .
i usually keep it to myself but it truly bothers me .
i 'm not so offended by any one thing a person says that i 'll lose sleep over it .
it 's just that i ca n't wrap my head around the blatant stupidity and callous nature of many people who are thought to have figured the world out .
you can ask just about anyone and they 'll tell you that i 'm insensitive or have very little emotional range .
i 'm an analytical introverted atheist who does n't say bless you '' when people sneeze it 's not to make a statement there 's a story behind it and ca n't handle even moderate displays of emotion .
so why is it that i 'm shocked and upset every day by the things i hear coming out of the mouths of adults ?
i hear fully-grown adults calling people abba-dabbas '' when they could just as easily say middle-eastern '' .
i hear people say muslim '' when they mean a person whose skin is dark and has an olive undertone '' .
i 'll never forget the time i saw someone share a picture on facebook about hilary clinton that said she could n't satisfy her husband she ca n't satisfy america '' .
every single day someone complains about obama to me be it someone i 've known for years or someone who for whatever reason thinks it 's okay to talk politics to strangers it is n't .
i can never finish a sentence unless i 'm talking to my boyfriend because for some reason everyone else thinks it 's cool to interrupt .
i watch and personally experience people criticizing others for things they ca n't help cutting them down for things that are meaningful to them shoving opinions down their throats when opinions clearly are not wanted shaming and humiliating people publicly the list goes on and on .
people i like and respect will have full-blown bitching sessions about my generation right in front of me and the topic will be that we have no respect !
ironically the reason i do n't call those people out in the moment and put them on the spot in front of others is because i try to be respectful and understanding .
those same people will make up/assume and spread horrible impudent ideas about individuals or groups rather than simply asking a question or doing some research remember you have the world 's largest encyclopedia at your fingertips and then they 'll turn around and say that my generation is lazy .
that 's not to say that ignorance prejudice and a sickening lack of common courtesy do n't exist in my generation they do in every generation and every race religion socioeconomic class and political party .
it 's just that having isolated myself from most of my friends my selection of peers is made mostly of those older than myself at work family functions and miscellaneous errands i 'm more likely to run into a baby boomer than a college student .
i guess i just had this image in my head of those older than me as also being wiser not as ugly inside .
i suppose i should n't have assumed or generalized but it 's not really a concept that can be proven or disproven .

the shangri-la trailer was so well put together with the in the jungle '' it gave incredible excitement for the map and is why i do n't really hate the map .

i 'm quite new to wordpress and just have a few questions .
i recently read about the differences between wordpress.com and wordpress.org .
to my understanding wordpress.org is the site to use if you want customization but it costs a bit while wordpress.com is free if you have a .wordpress.com domain .
my question is could i use wordpress.org to create a website while still having a .wordpress.com domain name ?
or to even begin with wordpress.org do you need a custom domain and host ?
i saw a really amazing webpage today which had fun facts and data in an interactive format .

basically let 's call the guy x x is a friend of my best friend he asked her to take his son and cross the border with the kid because x is banned from doing so weird thing he can cross the border he does have papers to do so without the kid him and his wife .
so to take the kid to the doctor kid is a us citizen they asked my friend to cross the international border with the kid while x and his wife cross right after her .
honestly this seems like a load of bs to me and even tried to warn my friend she could get into big trouble for crossing a kid that it 's not hers specially since she is mexican and the kid american .
x saying for some reason he ca n't cross with the kid .
i really do n't want her to get into trouble over this .
location el paso tx i guess since that 's where the kid 's doctor is .
i created a video and everything seemed relatively easy to do .
when i export the video and play it the audio from some of the clips within the video do not play during the video .
when i was making the video i adjusted the volume audio adjustments audio volume on the individual clips .
some i set to 0 and others i set to 150 .
they play when i play the video in imovie but not when i play the video after exporting it .
all i hear is the music that i added to the video .
i wanted to try to finish this asap so any help is appreciated .
he 's never been a high ranking player or anything but he suddenly got a pass on freedom dive four dimensions a few months ago which alerted me to the fact that he was probably cheating possibly just these two scores below as they 're the only ones i 've seen that seem completely unrealistic for his level of skill .
it seems most likely that he 's using a macro or relax hack to do the streams .

this is a long post but contains things i found in the tfa and connected with the other six films hope you enjoy this is my first reddit post as well hope i followed the rules alright !
after watching the film several times i was able to find a few things in the film i have n't seen caught and talked about before .
i made up a huge post for this for friends that also involved the identity of snoke but i am going to leave all of that out because i am sure it has been talked to death on here .
i am just going to copy what i have previously wrote for the rey theory skipping the snoke theory of it leaving my summary at the end slightly confusing to those who did n't read that i skipped the snoke stuff !
so firstly lets quickly take care of the reason rey is not luke 's daughter or han and leia 's second child twin to kylo or younger sister .
i think it is too obvious that they want you to come out of the movie thinking it is luke 's daughter .
when would luke have gotten cozy with a woman ?
he started training jedi after the sixth film and then kylo and the knights of ren came in and killed all his padawan 's and he felt guilty about that and went into hiding .
and to debunk the but the lightsaber is calling her people '' lightsabers do n't call to people the force does .
while i can be okay with her being han 's second kid which i thought she was for a little while i think the force awakens tells us she is n't for a couple reasons .
now unless she is kylo 's younger sister and she was kidnapped at birth and han did n't know about her at all i do n't think she is their daughter .
leia would have had to say something about han as her dad or uncle luke being a jedi before she got left on that planet at the age of 5-9 .
she thinks luke is a myth and only has heard rumors of han as a famous smuggler .
and secondly which i think is the more important disqualifier for han 's kid maz kanata said to rey i see your eyes and you already know the ones you are waiting for are never coming back ... but there is someone who can . ''
like maz said if the people she is waiting for are never returning her family han is already with her and leia is landing on the planet so i think that disqualifies them .
then she says ... '' but there is someone who can '' meaning luke could still come back with rey 's help also disqualifying luke as being her father .
so now for the reason why i believe rey is obi-wan kenobi 's granddaughter .
throughout most of the saga obi-wan is just as much of a main character as any of the skywalkers .
and unlike the skywalkers he does n't use his emotions for strength in the force he uses his pure-heartedness his loyalty to the light and his compassion to help others .
he tells anakin he loves him at the end of their fight in revenge of the sith after everything anakin did .
obi-wan sounds more like the supposed chosen one than anakin does but more on that in a minute .
rey throughout the film acts more like obi-wan does than any skywalker .
she helps without question she free bb-8 does n't sell him and pleads to finn to not leave at maz 's place but to stay with her and help these people and the resistance to whom she has just only met because she knows she has to and it is the right thing to do .
she is a loner on a desert planet living in solitude .
her sneaking around star killer base just like obi-wan did the death star in episode 4 .
at the end of the lightsaber flashback scene with her they chose both alec guinness old ben kenobi and ewan mcgregor young obi-wan to say the line 'rey these are your first steps ' to her when she came to .
they cut old audio of alec to have him say 'rey . '
they could have chosen any other jedi from the series ... anakin yoda qui-gon mace windu but they chose obi .
picture the end of the obi-wan and anakin fight from revenge of the sith which is truly the transition of anakin to vader .
after obi-wan defeats anakin he could have killed him but instead he picked up his lightsaber and walked away .
rey could have killed kylo but did n't in almost the exact same fashion as obi .
here is a the music we only hear right before anakin and obi-wan fight in episode iii https youtu.be/0grwshfyylc ? t=194 you only have to listen to 3:30 .
now check out this from the kylo/rey fight in the force awakens https youtu.be/acve5nygjxi ? t=65 the same set of notes .
the only times we hear them are before anakin and obi-wan fight and when kylo and rey fight .
to build on the above this would then make the split in the ground all the more significant .
perfect symbolism for another skywalker and kenobi going on two very different paths much like both of their grandfathers .
but this time it will be up to the kenobi instead of another skywalker to bring the fallen skywalker back to the light .
these two pieces of music are almost identical from a new hope and the force awakens .
the former being when luke looks out to the horizon and he knows there is nothing left for him on tatooine and that he is going to go train with obi-wan to be a jedi .
the latter is from when rey is handing luke 's old lightsaber to him and luke realizes that there is nothing left for him there that he needs to train this girl a kenobi to fight the dark side one last time .
rey giving the lightsaber to luke https youtu.be/3kawsl4wjqa ? t=95
it is the same music again which is significant .
it is luke fulfilling his destiny to be trained by a kenobi and finally train a kenobi .
it is even more chilling when you think about how that lightsaber has found it 's way to luke ... through the hands of two kenobi 's .
to finish with rey i want to show you what i think has an incredibly large significance in this film the music .
before this final part you need to know the theme of the force and how it varies between characters .
for a refresher here is the theme of the force .
that theme is played very often throughout all 7 movies but depending who is on the screen or to which character the song is playing to or what events are happening in the film at the time the tone of the theme changes from mildly to drastically .
first the skywalkers anakin and luke have this theme play for them several times throughout the saga and it is always that i could find multi-instrumental .
the tone and pace varies a bit depending on what is happening in the film but anakin 's and luke 's force themes are very similar throughout all the films in regards to both themselves and each other .
the links should hopefully take you right to the spot to listen to and you should only need to listen for a few-several seconds for each .
this is in episode 2 when he returns to tatooine to find his mother .
this is also episode 2 when padme falls off the ship while they are chasing dooku and anakin wants to go after her but then ultimately realizes he needs to face dooku .
this is during a new hope after ben has told luke about the force and his father and the film focuses on luke https youtu.be/sonidwqk1u4 ? t=229
this is also in a new hope when luke is about to destroy the death star https youtu.be/ahqrcyervqq ? t=404
obi-wan usually has a single instrument sound from what i can tell and what i was able to confirm as his on top of it being very calming and gentle just like obi-wan .
when he is telling luke about the force in a new hope the film is focused on him https youtu.be/sonidwqk1u4 ? t=2
during qui-gon 's funeral when he tells anakin he will train him https youtu.be/pefojcg6jzq ? t=137
when obi-wan hands off baby luke to his family on tatooine sacrificing the rest of his life to watch over luke very obi-esque https youtu.be/bfb8k-v-omi ? t=50
after the death of yoda while talking to luke https youtu.be/wvnpabt9sag ? t=533
and lastly the moments right before his own death in a new hope https youtu.be/pdpdd1ve170 play that one right at the beginning the track opens with it .
now ... compare obi-wan 's force music to the one we get for rey when she remembers the force during the fight with kylo their lightsabers locked and she closes her eyes to feel the force https youtu.be/acve5nygjxi ? t=106
so i think rey is obi-wan 's granddaughter it makes the most sense and would be the most satisfying scenario to complete the saga .
a kenobi trained a skywalker who was supposed to be the chosen one but was actually created by plagueis falls to the dark side and destroys the jedi .
his son saves him but by doing so kills him .
plagueis still looms leaving the force out of balance so luke trains jedi his nephew another blood skywalker falls to the darkside as skywalkers have a tendency to they use their emotions freely .
but one lost kenobi rey is guided to luke by the force the last jedi master and a skywalker who was also trained by obi-wan to be trained as a jedi and redeem his nephew her grandfather from anakin 's fall and the jedi .
rey who will ultimately end up being the real chosen one and her brought back to the light companion who happens to be named after her grandfather ben solo a skywalker !
then together rid the galaxy of the darkside by destroying plagueis and the sith forever .
do you guys think he 'll keep going up or should i cut my losses ?
in short i 've had problems in the past on omegle trying to find girls and get them to be sexual with me .
unfortunately due to feeling extremely lonely i fell into my mind 's justification that it was just meeting new people .
but then i found a girl and i 'm really glad she did n't do anything for me .
but i still feel bad for coming so close .
do any of you have similar problems and how 'd you get over them ?
make sure you have a team that can constantly beat it you 'll need those credits to upgrade your characters .
thanks for such a great giveaway my first one that i have ever won .
sorry it 's been a little while but i decided to update after the past week of what has been going on with me and sarah .
first though i wanted to add the edit that i included on my op here since people were asking the following questions a lot and i 'm not sure if everybody saw it
we do n't live together because prior to this new job i did n't make as much and my apartment is very small and not meant for two people and she is doing her masters and only works part-time for low pay and does n't want to pitch in for rent so we can move to a bigger place .
even with my new job i ca n't afford a bigger place all on my own yet while also paying for student loans utilities my car which is a necessity where i live etc .
also i know 2-3x a week seeing each other is not a ton but we spend all my days off together .
we did n't see each other more than this prior either because my old job was still 40 hours and i was also going to school .
people think it 's strange that i mentioned her being introverted as if it were a bad thing .
i used to think i was happy not seeing our friends often but my job is social in nature and i find that i enjoy being more outgoing than i used to be .
this does n't mean i go out every night i see my friends/cousin maybe once every 1-2 months or that i want to go to bars and clubs but it does bug me that any time i suggest doing anything she makes an excuse like she does n't like the person has no interest in meeting new people does n't feel like seeing her friends does n't feel like getting dressed up she 's tired etc .
additionally i 've been asked a lot what i 've done to support her and why i expect support .
let me make it clear first that i have never asked her to run an errand or do anything for me before .
i asked this one time because i was exhausted and stressed .
i did n't expect her to drive an hour to drop it off at my partners house just leave it on my bed so i could grab it on my way home .
as for what i do to support her i 've helped her many times with research for papers when she was stressed over school i 've taken a week off of work when one of her relatives died and she needed to be with someone i 've taken her car to get fixed numerous times etc etc .
i text or call her whenever i can which is multiple times a day and i talk to her every night when i get off .
i do n't even spend tons of off-duty time with my partner .
the one time at the bar was literally the first time i 've seen him outside of work we have just been talking about all getting together for ages .
so now that 's out of the way i am not a spy or hit-man or something crazy .
a few of you tried to convince me that i am an asshole for not disclosing my job since apparently i ca n't be given advice without saying it .
i described so many details in my last post that i hope people can just give me at least one ounce of anonymity .
my career is known for cheating only because of the unpredictable hours .
some scumbags apparently a lot of them on yahoo questions and weddingbee and other cesspits of advice that show up on google use these hours to their advantage ie oh i got caught on overtime tonight '' when really they are out cheating .
this is not a prevalent thing in my experience but my girlfriend sarah was googling my career spouse '' came across 100 's of articles most of them benign and latched on to the few that stated we all used our schedules for the sake of cheating and nothing else .
a lot of you told me that the only reason i admired my work-partners wife is because she showed her best face to me in public .
of course this is true i do n't expect anyone to be perfect .
what stands out to me however is that there is a lot of downtime in my position and my partner and i bullshit .
every single thing that he has ever said about his wife is positive .
naturally i would hope that would be the case for anyone but i see something in the way he talks about her that i do not feel when i think about sarah .
he ruminates about their vacations and silly stories and stupid random nights they have together and i realized that i do n't get to enjoy any of that with her .
sarah does n't like being out of her comfort-zone .
i never knew that this bothered me before but when i saw how funny and silly they acted together right in front of my face it just confirmed that i could actually have fun in a relationship .
it made me realize that i am not having fun .
so after i slept over my work-partners house sarah was n't talking to me except for sending me passive-aggressive texts about how she hoped that i enjoyed my romantic evening '' and that she hoped he was worth it . ''
many of you indicated how insecure she must be that we can barely spend much time together and suddenly it seems like i am becoming close to someone new when after 6 years we maybe were't as close as we could/should be .
i took this to heart and i saw her point .
so the next time i was off this past sunday i took her out to brunch one of the few activities she likes to do bought us some mimosas to break the ice and tried to talk to her about the way that she 's been feeling .
i started the conversation saying i know it sucks that we ca n't see each other as much as we wish we could right now and believe me i wish that could be the case .
however i feel like this is causing more tension than it used to and i want to know what you 've been feeling about all of this lately . ''
i was hoping for an honest conversation where we could both learn from each other and move forward with new compromises but ... she just unleashed .
she told me that she just does n't think i have a reason to be close to anyone but her that my partner sounds like a faggot '' her words not mine that just wants to fuck me that his wife is probably just fed up with not getting any dick from him and is trying to move in on me and on and on .
it retrospect i feel like she is just very insecure and this was her way of attacking me and trying to hold me back so i could reassure her .
but at the moment i could n't think of a way to respond .
i tried to deny what she was saying explain to her that it was n't the case and asked what i could do to show her but she just kept verbally assaulting my partner and his wife and me for even entertaining the idea of being friends with them .
i stopped talking and we ended up finishing our meal in silence her fuming me just feeling awkward at this point .
afterwards we got back into my car and i started driving towards her house .
she noticed that we were n't going towards the direction of my apartment and she started yelling at me for trying to drop her off and not wanting to spend more time with her .
i drove to her house in silence her berating me the entire way and then listened to her continue to scream at me for ten minutes after we pulled up until finally getting out slamming the passenger door and going inside the house .
i went back to my apartment spent about 30 minutes on the phone with my sister 2 years younger than me asking her wtf i should do and then decided probably cowardly after such a long relationship but really not wanting to be screamed at anymore to send her a long text message about my reasons for breaking up with her .
she did n't take this well and blew up my phone over and over until i just turned it off completely .
the next day i had work and i tried to talk to her about things back and forth over text but she kept deferring back to her state of cursing at me and insulting me .
in the end i just told her that i could no longer be a part of her life and blocked her .
so that was 4 days ago and i have n't heard from her since she deleted her facebook though .
and honestly i 've felt a lot calmer these last 4 days than i have in a long time .
it makes me feel guilty at times but also kind of excited that i can act however i want to act from now on without someone looking down at me for it .
tl dr tried to work things out took sarah out to brunch we got into a fight i broke up with her .
so early last year my parents told me that we were going to go on a year long road trip in an rv i immediately told them that it was a bad idea and that it would be too much stress on me to be away from my lifelong friends for a year .
i also noted that on any trip i get home sick within the first 2-3 days .
they told me trust me when you grow up you will be glad you did this it will all be good memories . ''
we left on this trip about 4-5 months ago in august .
after the first week i was completely homesick and ready to tear my hair out .
every week it has gotten worse and worse to the point of me being suicidal and my online schooling for this year is only making it worse .
i ca n't help bit feel that allnof this is their fault because they did n't even give me a choice when the outcome of the trip could be life changing for me .
it is n't even that they wanted to go and i would n't have anywhere to stay my grandparents on both sides of the family offered me a place to stay .
they just wanted me to go knowing full well that i would hate every minute of it and now they are threatening to ground me because i am not having fun .
this is a bit biased towards my pov but there isnt much i can do for that .
edit there is alot i failed to say in this but none of it should change your opinion it just changes some things already hinted .
but besides that i thank you all for helping me deal with this .
my parent are flying me and my sister home soon because my sister has to do state testing i will try to get my parents to let me stay home with grandparents instead of flying back out .

today i remembered a cartridge game i played as a kid .
i do n't know what console it was one and remember only little bit of vague information but i hope it 's enough .
it was a game where you played as a little dragon that shot fireballs from his mouth that produced similar sound hhhh '' to bowsers fireballs from the old super mario bros .
i also think there was a world map and big boss fights that involve platforming .
there may have also been multiple characters that you could play but i 'm not sure about that .
know it 's not much information to go on but i hope something will come up .
my pc was built during the times were ssds were small and expensive therefore explains my 60gb ssd well programs and general windows stuff filled up quick in it and theres always only like around 5gb left on it .
for some reason windows 10 can never auto install updates on my pc without my permission because windows can not install updates you must have at least 10gb on c drive '' however updates definitely do n't take up more than a few megabytes so i can just go to the updates page and manually install anything i want anytime .

watching gameplay videos is not much helpful as attack moves are chained to more moves and it is hard to make out where one begins and ends .
honestly i use to love back in the day when i could go to the forums and create duo teams trios even 5 man bandos and others teams regardless i do n't find making teams in osrs the same as before i 'm always worried about people getting a drop and not splitting there was never this problem in the past because coin share would split it for you in cash !
and if you didnt want to use coinshare then it could be lootshare but it was fair because everyone who was in the cc fighting the boss had a chance at receving loot as of now it just goes to the player with the higher damage meaning someone who is higher stats gear then you will get the drop 90 or more of the kills most of the time so making random groups on the fourms in my head is n't save because i always run the chance of not getting my share or my fair chance at the drop even though im putting in my time and effort in particapting in pvm right now i 'm getting bored of playing osrs because i cant boss with a team correctly without having to join a clan and i do n't have the time to keep up with a clan im a casual player who would like to find public teams on the forums with some sort of saftey net for looting items .
honestly jagex the update of lootshare need to be made before this bullshit fire cave extension fix pvm please and help the community feel safer with playing with other people thats what the whole point of a mmorpg is to play with others !
tl dr bring lootshare and coinshare into osrs before fire cave extension plz .
is this team is okay or should i keep rerolling ?

i started playing diablo 3 more often due to the beginning of the new season .
when i bought the game about one year ago i started playing crusader .
at the moment i guess i have all items i need .
i have all the sets and the most important items .
i tried sweep roland 's blessed hammer all items ancient but the shoulders and the weapon bombardment lon and thorns invoker .
blessed hammer felt so weak ... like seriously i deal no dmg .
the problem is i do n't know why i know it is n't meta but i expected it to still do well since it did n't get nerfed i guess ?
for the sweep build i did n't have thunderlord 's vigor when i last tried it now i have it ancient .
i did no dmg last time was this only because of the missing belt ?
the thorns build http www.d3planner.com/322734318 is what i play in solo atm .
the problem is that i do n't know where exactly i need to improve .
i know i should get a few more ancient items and the shield is not that good socket .
where should i set my priorities in this build ?
i play it with my friends in 4man rifts atm .
we have a sup wd sup barb wizard and my sader .
i 'm not sure if the bombardment build is the way to go ... even though it 's way better than the thorns in this set up that 's at least what i believe .
this build is fun to play in groups and in solo .
in solo i get to 65 with it but i feel like the dmg is n't enough yet .
i think i just need an ancient aquila cuirass and ancient rings .
but i 'm not sure if that is all .
i 'm not sure what the most viable build is .
i have a lot of items that are n't bad but i dont know where i should put my priorities .
so i met my good friend 's grandpa who did rotc and commissioned out of upenn in the late 50 's .
his degree was in something related technology possibly in engineering or applied math and the army was dying for officers to get into it 's new computer program which was under active duty mi or signal at the time .
seeing this opportunity my friend 's grandfather jumped at the opportunity and placed that assignment and anything somewhat related to it at the top of his wish list .
you 'd think that this guy would be a good fit for this right ?
being that he was a upenn tech geek wanting to get into computer stuff .
the good ole ' accessions process fucked him and gave him a reserve transportation corps assignment as a railroad coordination officer .
so my fellow cadets do n't take it too personally if the accessions process fucks you over because it 's done it to countless cadets ever since rotc was even a thing .

so one of the biggest bummers of the pstv was its lack of compatible psn games specifically ones that my all means should run .
there 's even a massive list of every game unable to run on the pstv .
i had heard that the best way to ensure you 're only buying games the pstv can run is to use the psn store app on it but i noticed that some games that are specifically listed as incompatible are showing up .
several of the metal gear games started appearing and it would be great if this means compatibility was patched in for them but to be honest i ca n't really remember if they really just appeared or if the psn store on pstv shows incompatible games .
does anyone know if they can be played now ?
or if the whole psn library was always listed as part of some sick act of schadenfreude on sony 's part ?

besides the great visuals i honestly found it a very dull movie .
i loved the bear scene though and that was the only time i felt like this was a brutal '' and gut-wrenching '' movie .
i may have felt something more when misfortunes crossed the protagonists path but i just did n't care about him nor did i care about his mission .
i wonder if i simply did n't watch this movie in the same way other people did .
as someone who looks for interesting writing which keeps me guessing and invested i just found nothing in this movie besides a few very brief moments like the blink if you wan na die '' scene for example .
other than that it was straight forward and nothing i had n't seen before .
just another revenge story but without any original twists and turns .
it really was a movie that was supposed to take you on a long and rough ride but it was a snoozer for me .
i guess people loved it for different reasons but i personally think the writing is the skeleton of any movie and the revenant was a sagging corpse ... but it did look pretty and was for the most part technically impressive .
i can see how it would have an impact on the easily queazy or people easily entertained and satisfied by a flashy screen but it 's just not worthy of the overwhelming reviews from people like yms .

well the space '' on my keyboard is actually a very large bar so there 's that .
let me put it this way i am maximum hr165 .
i find a little challenge when i do the hr80 quests and a good challenge when i do the current zinogre plesioth gigginox and diablos quests .
the hr level of the quests does n't always correlate with the difficulty of the quests .
i 'm going to assume you have a full set of 3 star equipment and maximum level .
i believe you will find hr40 quests medium challenge and hr60 almost impossible .
just hang in there and try to get hr up as much as you can so you have access to the higher quests .
another thing to note is this just because you get to hr60 does n't mean you can beat the quests .
when i finally unlocked hr60 i still could n't beat those quests because they were too hard .
so i made a point to raise my hr as fast as possible since raising hr gives you more attack and defense .
your goal now that you have max 3 star equipment should be
these drop 4 star equipment and are n't too hard .
then consider that there are a hell of a lot worse things than this happening to hundreds of men women and children right at this very moment .

pretty much pact makes your draws a lot more explosive but at the same time it 's way less resilient .
pact is a dead card if they can keep you off a critical mass of elves .
chord also shines in games 2 and 3 where it makes your sideboard a lot stronger whereas pact generall gets worse as you dilute the elf engine to bring in hate .

qidian relatively recently introduced a new tag ÂπªÊÉ≥‰øÆ‰ªô that supersedes the old tag that was used for things like stellar transformation and xian ni Â•áÂπª‰øÆÁúü although they have n't really bothered to retroactively change them .
presumably because of arguments that Â•áÂπª was being used to describe western-influenced/styled fantasy stories and that did n't apply to those .
i guess they ca n't even agree on their own tags .
for issth and de the tag used for that is Âè§ÂÖ∏‰ªô‰æ† and for the most part the mc does n't strictly have to be a daoist or whatever cultivation system as long as he is a relatively amicable/good person and the world building is done a certain way .
under the web novel tagging system journey to the west and investiture of the gods would fall under Ê¥™ËçíÂ∞ÅÁ•û .
all of these tags are subcategories under xianxia cause i suppose the difference is relatively minute for most people .
when playing with training roulette in long war the default version of tr you are generally going to be building very offensive minded troops as you 'll have access to perks like bring 'em on aggression and vital point targeting very often .
your squads will generally want to go glass cannon one hard tank style composition-this usually means either fast mec troopers or alloy shivs to start taking hits since most of the rest of the squad is damage perk oriented .
psionics is generally not very good with default tr since you lose out on a lot of will baked into some perks .
taking officer perks that provide raw stat boosts is generally worthwhile .
gene mods that provide stat boosts are also very useful as is holotargeting .
combat drugs and pulse weapons just murder in the late game since you have crit and crit damage perks on a lot of soldiers .
you really do n't have to go plasma and perks like vpt can make lasers last long enough to skip gauss too .
scouts i used them as officers and jammed hit and run with marksman rifles+scope+marksman scopes along with damage perks .
you can get things like vpt and beo early in the tree and they do big damage .
i like hyper-reactive pupils and adrenal neurosympathy on them since hit and run kills are some of the first kills you make in a mission since the action is free .
build lots of scouts and make the ones that do n't go into being officers pathfinders .
scouts are good early on and level up very fast once they get a laser strike rifle and even faster once they get hit and run .
rapid fire is fairly iffy until very late game due to the need to place higher aim troops in other classes and the lack of aim gains from perks .
they basically suppress and shoot and robots which as it turns out is pretty damn good for most of the game .
pupils keys off suppression shots and is worth having .
medic-the default tr lets you build them more or less just like you would build them normally .
suppression and the smoke grenade perks to get combat drugs then bombard and savior .
the main difference is that you ca n't really justify going steadfast here without the 5 will bonus .
it 's real hard to get the overwatch perks lined up in a reasonable time before overwatch stops being useful and also really hard to get all the tanking perks you need with tr enabled .
again fall back on mec troopers and alloy shivs to help absorb the shots .

it 's worth noting the assumption that because an objective moral standard exists then we can follow it is based on nothing .

i do n't disagree so run the long tube behind it via a bulkhead fitting .
except it 's their pr team that is saying this not ours .
munch mitt heading your way if you 're reading this please add some more items to your wish list looks like it was just emptied out .
lots of people seeing this right now are ready to assist .
though i 'm in no way trying to downplay the fact that he was used and bred into this behavior .
everyone involved those who knew the older women his manager and fried and yes even steven is at fault .
i would 've gladly paid for premium and gave ncsoft my money if they actually let me play the game for free before i do spend money on it now for 2 days in a row i 've had 6 hours queue time to play something else i guess xd
at the risk of provoking you i 'd like to ask who else 's fault a calamitous crash could be ?
john and jane public are n't exactly governing market forces in this day and age and it 's pretty obvious what class of people are calling the shots politically .
i 'm not saying this is a catastrophe nor am i advocating eating anybody i 'm legitimately curious .
i had to take out federal loans to attend as well but that was it between the awesome scholarship they gave me based on my community college grades and the generous financial aid package based on the fact that any college would have considered me in need of financial help so they considered me to be in super need .
it wound up being about the same cost for me to attend smu as it would have been for me to attend either unt or ut dallas only the cost of textbooks out of pocket so i went with them since it 's the better school .
we typically go at the end of september ... it helps with the crowds
i live in brisbane also and i have n't been having these issues with my stream or any other australian stream i watch .
i think possibly you 're being throttled without your knowledge i know optus was doing it for a while until people realized and they were forced to update things on their end .

love sd mainly because i have a pretty broad hero pool and i can never seem to decide who i want to play .
but still do n't trust in my luck to not random meepo twice haha .
i definitely would like to see what my team mates available heroes are much more easily so this ui would be great
lt did n't even settle into a position until what this year ?
from what my amateur eyes saw this year he 's a 300 lineman that still has a lot of his mlb quickness .
i 'm not going to predict that it will happen but i would n't be surprised to see him be a guy that goes in the 6-fa range gets some nfl coaching on how to play on the line and makes a name for himself .
i do n't think he becomes an all-pro or anything like that but i think he stays in the league .
i had two older sisters so most of my toys growing up were my little ponies and rainbow bright shit ... my murky plush was the most dude thing i had .
like it shields them from understanding how parking tickets work
not to mention how utterly useless it would be for the state of new hampshire to waste any time on this .
there might be one or two people a year in nh who owe delinquent taxes and use bitcoin to pay back the state .
hell bitcoin would be my least preferred method of payment if i owed a debt like that .
the whole thing sounds more like an effort to legitimize bitcoin rather than provide any actual benefit to the state and so they were correct to shoot it down .
this is indeed one of the most difficult things i 've ever had to do .
i 'm just angry at how i handled things ... we had several huge arguments today the exact same things we used to argue about drinking he 's an alcoholic smoking him playing video games and saying that was spending time together '' .
now i 'm beating myself up for saying it ... we were both at fault .
he was finally agreeing to try things again and i was angry and said something i now regret .
i do n't think he 'll ever try with me again we 've gone through this cycle many times .
at the same time i know it 's best to maintain nc for now .
clearly we are not healthy for each other even if individually we are good people .
i want so badly to blame him for everything because i sincerely think i did everything possible to make things work .
but honestly i have my fair share of faults and regardless blaming and complaining that things are n't fair '' is n't helpful .
just need to maintain nc and clear up my head .
sorry for venting so much but thank you for being here .
thats like saying theres no such thing as mild hypertension .

are you ready to explain to every cop bar keep etc the distinctions ?
i 'm gon na do a lady from behind though .
i do believe that generally speaking women like x and women like y. yeah they 're a few acceptions but overall it 's true .
for example a needy man more unattractive to a woman than a needy woman being unattractive to a man .
women like men who can play instruments or do cool stuff .
with a man to a woman not so much .
women tend to be held to a higher standard for looks men tend to be held to a higher standard for personality traits .
i dont think anyone here understamds what is going on .
shats happening is when you inhale you creative negative pressure .
when you stop inhaling and that pressure goes from negative to neutral and water falls it pushes air out which is why anything in the bowl will go flying

re activism yeah shit tons of people in and outside this sub do stuff like that .
pod certainly had good numbers but there are lots of ways to measure performance and that 's by far the best one .
i just think it 's unfair that people always trot out that one number as if it 's representative of the power of the deck when clearly it 's an outlier .
it 's not like the deck was 75 of top 8s .
as an individual born and raised in stl feel free to make yourselves my new team by stealing some guys who played in this city .
might i suggest aaron donald in a few years ?
you save 460 a month ! ? ! ? ! ?
a lot of people with higher incomes do n't save that .
that aside majora 's mask seems like a pretty decent one to choose .
i do n't think this is what your asking but you worked in base 6 than 60 '' would be what we call 36 in base 10 .
therefore x/60/60 would be x/36/36=x/1296 in base 10 or in base 6 x/10000 .
i was billed a total of 227 by the dmv of which the 92 was salvage related '' fees and the rest the registration fees '' as mentioned by the dmv employee i spoke to .

i think your problem is that he still plays up front and is still always near the opportunity to beat the offside .
i mean i 'm just armchairing it here but i was able to have zouma unlearn 'gets forward whenever possible ' on fm14 and i think that was because he was a defender and that preferred move made no sense in the first place .

my quick view is sell the property and draw down is their a stamp duty concession even if possible as otherwise you could be up for stamp duty
the reason these people believe these things exist is because they believe the authors of the bible believed these things to exist and the bible for them is 100 true .
to be clear true and descriptively accurate are not the same thing .
so if the authors of the bible believed demons are real then they are real and we must vote cruz trump 2016 to make the gays illegal again and save houston tx from being katrina 'd by god .
well that just comes from animus and bigotry it is clearly against the word of the bible .
i 'm serious and it has nothing to do with gays .
the bible repeatedly has god saying that if the people are good he will bring rain and if the people are bad he will bring drought .

get a young girl who is excited about the thought of doing some modeling bring her to an exciting place that she normally might not have gone to get her distracted by the excitement of being there having fun going to the beach and going shopping then if she says she does n't want to participate in the shoot tell her that 's fine but she has to pay you back for the hotel flight to bring her out that she has to pay for her flight back home which they would say would be thousands of dollars even if it was n't they just drop a big number that is unlikely to be an amount the girl has available to her at the time .
they take advantage of the situation the girl is in she 's alone in a big city she does n't know and now has a decision thrust upon her to either do x or go home and pay thousands in order to be able to do so .
i would imagine they do n't give her a lot of time to think about it either .

i know the actual shoot itself must have been awful but how it 's altered your life since then is unfair and i hope you 're able to have a normal life beyond it .

i have a macbook air 11 inch from 2010 or 2011 .
its worked great and still does but its not as good as before and the keyboard got fucked up due to having a dog that likes to jump on the table .
anyways the mac i have is still working and will be used by my wife for her cintiq tablet and corel painter since she doesnt need a keyboard for it .
i was offered by a friend a macbook air 13 inch brand new bougth for the bf for christmas then cougth him fucking another dude so he offered it to us for 700 usd .
should i get the mac for 700 or would i be better off building a pc for the same price ?
this is probably the wrong place to ask but just so you guys know i am not great with computers and i loved that the mac was so easy to use but hate features like non removable battery and price .
so what do you guys recommend for a computer noob ?
i will not be using the computer for gaming or anything like that i just want a good quality computer as i bougth a cheap one last year 200 usd and regreted it dearly
also if you recomend building a pc can you point me in the rigth direction ?

i fix this shields will be splintered shields in the broken blade http gamingballistic.blogspot.com/2016/01/shields-will-be-splintered-shields-in.html
i have to get an u/a pretty frequently so i have a lot of pictures .
has anyone seen anything cool done with u/s pics ?
psionics the powers of the mind a power that is naturally yours .
this is something one does normally think fits better in a cyberpunk or high future setting and i agree mostly but i also feel it works in a fantasy setting as well .
well i feel it is a bit misinterpreted as in it is still treated as psionics by being called psionics and of course its named that because that is what it is but it should not be viewed nor named that when used in a fantasy setting but rather something else .
what i feel psionics always have been is a different version of ki powers or chakra or the power of your own mortal soul channeled through your mind as in your concience .
psionics should not be named psionics it should be named spirit or something along those lines i feel .
now the reason why i like psionics before divine or arcane powers is because psionics is not something you pray for or manipulate from outside its your power when the wizard has spent his magic he is empty when the cleric is done he has to pray more but the psion ?
he is still psionic not game wise so far but i will get to that i think .
now to get to my point i think that whenever they introduce psionics into d d next i hope to see them create a psionic class where they are the class with the weakest '' casters but they always have the ability to call upon it but they get tired from it its like a supernatural extra arm which they train and use .
my thought is as follows i think that divine magic should be the most powerful '' by itself but also most linear and rigid you can cast this spell '' but it cant do anything else and you can call upon this power only this many times per day so i feel divine magic is best represented the way it is with spell slots .
wizards and sorcerors better fit with using the system psions have been using as in with power points where a wizard have this much magical energy everyday and spend it however they like .
i think they should have supernatural powers that kinda work as skills and that they instead of having spells or powers per day they get tired as in they get strain points '' or something like that and if they get too many they might fall prone and unconcious .
so in short what i would like to see is divine the most powerful '' by itself but also most rigid '' arcane more freeform but harder to master and psionics the least powerful '' but gives you the most utility and freedom of usage .
that and psionics are misnamed it needs a new name for fantasy settings to better fit in .
i have a 26 inch sharp 720p hdtv i 've had since 2007 and an hdmi cable .
what is the best reference level and color space for it ?
i have it on 1080i standard and rgb right now .
i know every tv is different and that i should experiment but i 'd appreciate if someone could eliminate some choices for me to make it easier .
also what is the difference between auto and source ?
i wonder what our purpose is as a species .
everything on this planet seems to serve a purpose but us .
insects so small so fragile yet plentiful and very significant in our ecosystem .
could be to serve as food to a spider or to spawn a new generation of its kind .
yet none of these insects seek more than to survive as long as nature would allow .
these creatures never imagine a visit to another country they dont aspire to collect and maintain any sort of wealth other than what it stockpiles for survival .
insects are simple by themselves but complex en mass .
humans want lust steal torture deceive and kill for things that serve little to no purpose for survival such as money .
we hold shiny and attractive material things over the things we or others use to survive .
most would let a homeless man dig through the trash to eat a half eaten and moldy piece of food then to grab a few cans or extra food in the home and make sure that man eat a clean good meal .
we hold ourselves high with ideas like if you were to give him money he would abuse it on intoxicants that most people who work use as well so we pass on by and deny him our change .
yet no one returns with food to remove the option of purchase variety .
how many people dream of traveling around our planet for fun ?
of that small amount of succeeding individuals i can safely assume the success of most was created by a landslide of burying debt and unfavorable circumstances on a mass of less fortunate .
we are the only species who seeks more than just survival and we are willing to end the survival of another to get that .
we seek to see know own touch taste explore and discover more so what is it we are supposed to find ?
what place or thing or idea are we supposed to gain ?
put here like bacteria in a test tube to determine our race as purposeful or destructive .
are we to save this planet or destroy it ?
what i dont understand is why we destroy each other when clearly we prosper more fruitfully when the whole of the race is cooperative .
i feel that we are here to better ourselves and our planet yet we are firmly headed in the opposite direction .
if this continues we shall surely dig our planets grave and put a large caliber bullet right through the head of our race burying them side by side while our corpse rots and our planet slowly suffocates .
with the amount of skin we can show would n't it be cool to have custom scars as a separate texture on the body ?
i would love playing as rico wearing white dapper italian suit or clothing from jc1 .
i really like forcemaster so far only i think i will struggle in pvp
so essentially i have been wanting to gm savage worlds for quite some time now and currently do n't have a dedicated group .
one idea i have been toying with however is gming for my brother for a solo session/campaign/thingamajig .
i was wonderig if any of you have run solo adventures and what you did to help things go along .
i am a relatively new associate and i have been trained to work the service desk .
today something suspicious occurred and i 'm wondering what my next course of action should be .
i did a card cashing service for a young man who wanted to withdraw 800 .
he slid the card on his side and i 'm pretty sure he used a pin number .
there was some time that passed and i completed several other transactions throughout the course of my shift ... . moneygrams money orders card cashing check cashing etc ... and then another gentleman came to use the card cashing service for 500 ... .. but i recognized the card was the same card that was used not too long ago by the first young man .
i immediately asked the man for his id which he could not produce and he left and i did not complete the transaction .
i had a gentleman come to my register way earlier in the day and he used the card cashing service as well .
he slid the card on his side and put in the pin the same way the young man did ... . and once i put all the pieces together ...
i 'm fairly certain that the three gentleman are somehow connected and were all using the same card .
the card cashing service does require you to put in a pin to withdraw funds right ?
i was under the impression that it does ... . but let me know if it does n't .
i also asked about the msar forms which i learned about in the cbl 's and not a single person in the building knew where they were ... . and most people did n't even know what i was talking about .
the msar form is a way to report suspicious activity .
... and i managed to find one myself off of the wire .
i also informed my csm about the situation and asked her to look up the transaction records if possible in the smart system for the register where the transactions occurred since the transaction number would make things easier to track the suspects involved in the fraud ... . and she could n't find anything ...
idk if she just did n't know how to look or what
so ... .. should i talk to accounting tomorrow and tell them what happened ?
is it even worth filling out an msar report if i do n't have any transaction numbers or id 's for any of the suspects involved that 's leaving over half of the form blank ?
i have the form half filled out ... . but its missing some pretty vital information that
1 i will never get because the suspects are long gone
2 i ca n't get ... since the transaction records are unavailable without escalating this to either ap accounting ... . or maybe a csm who knows how to use the smart system properly .
so this girl invited me my friend and his friend to her crib .
i know him but i 'm not that cool with him .
so after we are all high as shit i ended up getting her snapchat .
she was like i hope your not asian from the waist down . ''
tl dr power cable ca n't reach over longer graphics card to motherboard .
what is a good small graphics card the size of the gt430 for under 150 ?
everything is housed in a large thermaltake case which was what i could afford at the time and liked .
if i use my xfd hd radeon 7770 graphics card 1 gb of gddr5 ram then the power cable for the mother board is not long enough to reach so i put back in an older geforce gt 430 card .
should i simply buy another case where the power supply would be in a better position allowing the use of the larger card or does anyone know of a better card that is the size of the gt 430 ?
i could also buy another power supply where the cable is longer ... but i 'd rather put the money into improving the system .
i 'd like to keep things under 150 ... and even that 's pushing it .
if there was a smaller graphics card i 'd be fine with a 2 gb or less one but i do n't wish to purchase a new power supply and a new graphics card as i 'd be just fine with the performance of the 7770 .
da inquisition is the most demanding game i play on the system and it runs on the gt430 just fine for my needs/wants .
using a 720p television running at 1360 by 768 .
i have a samsung un55hu6840 tv and a denon avr x3000 stereo system .
so if i connect an hdmi between both devices i can get audio i.e .
my pc if it 's hooked up via the tv through the stereo correct ?
i was thinking about using an optical cable originally but arc sounds more advantageous .
near the end of the dialog achilles presents crab with the following musical piece
from crab 's reluctance i assumed that this corresponds to a statement in tnt which is of indeterminate theoremhood .
out of curiosity i have attempted to translate this statement to more natural notation and come up with the following
i have not taken any classes of this sort in very many years so i have probably completely botched that notation and will attempt to express it in english as well
for any natural numbers a b and c such that 2a b c there exist no natural numbers d and e such that 2+d 2+e is equal to either b or c .
this statement appears to me to be easily proven to be false with a counter example of a b c 4 d e 0 giving 2¬∑4 4 4 and 2 0 2 0 4 .
as such i expect the piece composed by achilles is not a theorem of tnt and crab should easily be able to identify it as non-beautiful if played .
this conclusion however is very unsatisfying and so i must instead assume that i have made some error along the way .
i sadly do not possess the skill nor the patience to try to derive achilles 's piece in tnt .
searching google for the piece did not lead me to any elucidation on this topic .
but snow in arkansas http imgur.com/g1dricn.jpg is always cause for cheers !
the beer is a simple kolsch/blonde recipe i brewed a little while ago .

i ask myself if this madness will ever come to an end
giving heroin my entire body and soul i always come running back to its magnetic pull
watching the blood rush as i pull back the plunger
i feel the grips of addiction take me back under
i know all of the consequences but i no longer care
my eyes become glazed over my face a lifeless stare
allowing it to take over my life until the very end
even after all it 's put me through i ca n't stop using still
i 'm still in love with this drug despite all the brutality
a toxic relationship that 'll take me to an early grave
no matter what it 's still all that i crave
so hard to give up but it 's something i must eventually tackle
because i 'm so sick of being cuffed and shackled
i will have full collectors and storages and as i intend to go th9.5 i will upgrade lab sf and cc first .
question is what would you upgrade in the lab first ?
i love to war and mainly use laloon golaloon and goho .
i usually brush once a month or sometimes every week .
i have had i think 4 fillings and i have a few more cavities .
also one was removed because i was missing a baby tooth or something like that and it got a cavity and another when i was a little younger because i was in so much pain .
my teeth are n't really in pain except one .
my gums are looking red and there is a white line on some of my teeth near the gums .
i 'm going to brush everyday and use mouthwash and maybe floss every other day .
i 'm going to a dentist as soon as possible which could take up to a month or two .
is there anything else i can do to make them better or repair them at all if that is possible ?
i want them to look nice and be real i do n't want dentures .
this is pretty close to what mine look like but a little worse in some spots and a little better in others
it 's minimum wage but i am excited about the experience it has to offer especially for when i apply for graduate school .
i start early february but i am worried i will jeopardize my job by going out of town march 26-april 13th ... i had this trip booked before finding out i was hired .
how should i proceed about notifying my new employer ?
so from what i 've gathered from the podcast about invention https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=6veznxzcaoo and the nxt+invention stream
augmenting a weapon then leveling it up to 10 and then destroying it will yield a big chunk of invention xp
i believe the number thrown by moltare was 300k-ish ?
if you choose not to destroy the weapon you will get considerably less xp cost of being gp friendly .
only draw back is that getting the components is extremely rng and time consuming to gather enough plate or chi .
i will be stoked if this is a viable option to train the skill p
i feel my thong slide down my legs and arch my back enjoying the cool breeze on my labia as he guides the little slip of silk down my legs and off the bed .
another hand grazes my stomach and hips before settling lightly at first but with increasing urgency on my waxed sex .
my best friend 's face swims into view in front of me as i kneel back onto my heels spreading myself for the gentle fingers .
but '' i gasp as she teases my labia and clit again taunting my wetness you 're ready . ''
her lips tease my neck then down my shoulders before settling onto my nipples .
i can feel his massiveness against my ass now almost surging with power as my best friend spreads me wide for him ... .
horny and want a threesome with a hot girl like my best friend and a huge cocked stud .
i would prefer a bit of backstory and buildup show me how well you fuck her while i watch make me sext him while he 's out with you have him pull his cock out under the dinner table ... boys welcome but girls jump to the front of the line .
i feel like gays are more open to friendships with their exes but how ?
im the one who decided the whole lets be friends '' thing but its like i still have resentment towards him .
and one day its like i hate him then the next im like okay shit happened move on then i start missing him and feel like crying .
how do you guys deal with seeing your ex ?
and how do you guys deal with break ups ?
all i new beforehand was that it starred gene hackman was directed and written by coppola and was generally well-regarded .
needless to say i was utterly blown away and my lack of knowledge certainly added to the experience .
i absolutely love the first two godfather films but it 's highly probable that this is coppola 's finest achievement .
compared to his other works it 's much more restrained and criminally under-seen .
it follows harry caul a lonely paranoid surveillance expert who becomes personally invested in his work when he comes to the conclusion that the couple he has been spying on is in grave danger .
warning if you have n't seen the conversation i strongly suggest that you stop reading .
it 's an utterly fantastic film and i recommend that you see it as soon as possible without reading into it at all .
it 's what i did and it was much more powerful because of it .
anyway i was very impressed and it gave me lots to think about so i was hoping that we could have a discussion about it .
hackman does a fantastic job of conveying his character 's emotions in a way that is n't forceful or shouty .
this aspect of the film offers a lot to unpack and analyse .
not only is it aesthetically pleasing but the visual storytelling is among the best i 've seen .
the placement and movement of the camera frequently and effectively reflects harry 's feelings .
one example is when the camera repeats the same closely framed circular motion around harry as he is trying to decide whether he can open up to meredith .
this dizzying and repetitious movement represents his dizzying paranoia and uncertainty .
another example is when he is in the crowded elevator at the director 's office .
the camera confronts harry 's face which exhibits clear discomfort in a jarring intrusive close up .
harry feels his personal boundaries being invaded and the first chance he gets he quickly moves away trying to escape the camera 's cold gaze .
considering that the film 's plot revolves around audio surveillance one would expect the sound design to play a significant role .
one thing that i found interesting was how the lines during the titular conversation are heard differently throughout the film as harry tries to piece it all together and interpret what is being said .
i read that multiple versions of the lines were recorded with slight variations to put the audience in harry 's position of trying to decipher the dialogue .
also a lot of the film is very quiet and subdued which made the loud moments so much more effective .
the scene where the bloody hand slams on the glass was so unnerving and unexpected for this reason .
this section is more open to interpretation as it is n't made clear whether harry 's apartment actually has been bugged .
harry strips and practically destroys his apartment in a vain search for the bug when he fears his security has been threatened .
the only thing he leaves unscathed is his saxophone which is also the only source of comfort he has left .
the final shot shows harry sitting down and playing the sax as the camera sweeps from side to side .
one possibility is that the bug harry 's fierce paranoia made him imagine the phone all and the bug .
the panning movement of the camera in the final shot also implies that the camera itself is inhabiting the role of a camera planted in his apartment .
the scene in which harry searches the hotel room quite frankly scared the crap out of me .
the aforementioned scene where the bloody hand drags along the glass genuinely terrified me .
i had to pause the film to recollect myself .
then a minute later i was treated to blood pouring out of a toilet .
feel free to discuss any aspect of the film you want !
as the title said what are you guys using to record ?
im personally looking into starting recording some of my games because its so sad when you miss amazing moments like for example adding a new exemplar to your montagne zoo .
i 'm trying to figure out the cost for a cl 9 staff or wand of magic missile but have it use two charges per casting .
i ca n't figure out what the cost is with 2 charges consumed .

but does anyone think any teams in the league would be willing to give some of the more prominently underperforming guys on the squad a shot based on their performance in years past ?
i know we all hate g staal and glass right now but they 've all had flashes of greatness throughout their careers .
do you think given the right pieces any teams out there would take a shot on them ?
yes i know they have ntc/nmc clauses but if they were given a better opportunity on a new team that believed in them do you think they would go ?

hey gang this build is replacing my core 2 duo 2.6ghz e6750/gts 250 1gb/msi p6n sli from 2007 that has received a few upgrades to memory and gpu over the years .
modern webpages are chugging and youtube videos are a little choppy sometimes .
i 've gotten into digital audio production and would like my computer to handle plugin-intensive daws with ease so i 'm starting with an i5-4690k .
i am trying to figure out whether to go haswell or skylake as well given that the i5-6600k is only 30 more .
i know it 's a tired concept but how much more future proof '' is the 6600k and ddr4 ram compared to the 4690k ?
is it worth the 50 premium for the chipset/mobo at this point in time ?
should i wait on this build altogether for prices to come down ?
also could i go for a cheaper processor or since i 'm building a system that i would like to last about as long as the previous should i just buy the best cpu/motherboard for this generation ?
if gaming what kind of performance are you looking for ?
i must admit that i have n't kept up with modern gaming mostly because my computer ca n't handle newer games .
i 'm interested in playing the witcher 3 and fallout 4 at medium-high settings with playable 50-60 fps .
my monitor supports 1920x1080 but i might be interested in playing with the resolution at 2560x1440 to see what the hype is all about .
i 've selected an r9 390 available for 274 which based on my research seems like an excellent price for the card .
i do n't have a strong interest in playing modern aaa games but that could change with this card .
would it be prudent to go with a more modestly priced option or should i splurge on an actually capable card for once ?
in the past i 've had an 8600gt 512mb and upgraded to a gts250 1gb with some light overclocking i 've had decent gaming experiences .
maybe it 's time to treat myself to a higher tier of card .
is the 390 8gb a good card to jump in on this generation of gpus or can i make a better choice here ?
post a draft of your potential build here specific parts please .

a somewhat confused request to see about her computer trash .
it had disappeared and she thought she 'd be able to search for it in the start menu but it did n't appear .
so we walk over to her desktop and minimize the windows covering the desktop .
and then we wait a bit as windows refreshes all the icons from cache .
and then we wait a bit more watching the movement of flickering icons travel across the desktop back to the top and down again .
turns out that yes the bin is there right where it should be .
because the desktop is full full enough that windows is placing icons on top of icons on top of icons in a jumbled mess that ... .
then back to my trusty unix systems i went .
i completely agree with gnome3 and the decision to not allow icons on the desktop .

there are few types of expansions in the lotro store single expansions and packs .
my suggestion is that you wait for a discount that we regularly get and buy all expansions in a bulk with a 50 75 discount .
this will make your quad pack with regular price 40usd down to 20usd for 4x expansions moria mirkwood isengard and rohan very cheap and that is a lot of content and helms deep again from 40usd down to 20usd .
i highly suggest you wait for expansions to drop on discount usually spring/summer/autumn/winter have heavy discounts on everything follow steam as well usually they have that to a week or so or at the same time when the lotro store has it .
first expansion starts at level 50 so by that time you have few options
option 1 grind your way with turbine points and buy territories when they go on discount in the lotro store with turbine points for about 400-500 turbine points each territory that you need like evendim that is 30-40 and misty mountains for example from lvl 40-50 by that time you should have enough turbine points for each territory by grinding turbine points its not hard its a bit time consuming and if you have a friend you can grind them super fast sometimes even higher levels need those deeds for the same reason or just to have them so dont be shy to ask in world chat
option number 2 that i will personally suggest in order to safe time and get some extra goodies is go vip for a month or two this way all non expansion territories are unlocked for you and you can go freely level up stack up on some turbine points from deeds and from the vip it self 500 month and go wherever you want freely until the first expansion .
now after you get all expansions and you reach level 95 there are no more expansions .
lotro has taken the rout of guild wars 2 or maybe they slipped in to maintenance mod not enough staff/money to build expansions nobody knows but that does not mean the game will end soon the game has few good years of life ahead and maybe even more look at ddo .
what i am talking is that each year we get a new mini expansions '' or few areas for example dol amrot pelargir osgiliath and minas tirith were all added separately and they are all big territories with a lot of quests and a lot of stuff to do .
in the past two years we got roving threats big world bosses in eriador and in gondor we got two 3x man instances and one 6 man instance and we got the bigg ass city of minas tirith with addition to two more big cities like dol amroth and pelargir we got a lot of content to be honest we got essences we got the legendary weapon system re-work few instances and skirmishes were fixed and of course few new big battles .
so what i am saying is that there is a lot of content and there is more to come like the 12 man raid cluster that is coming later this year and the new pvmp map .
again here you have the rout same as above option 1 grind your way to buy the territories during all expansions you surly would get a lot of turbine points or go vip and get all those areas for free .
by being vip you get everything unlocked in the high end tier getting free turbine points id suggest this way but not everybody wants to spend the cash so its understandable .
legendary weapon system has been reworked as well you no longer have to level up the whole weapon and spend points '' on specific skills only you have now all the skills and you can add tomes that you buy with marks and meds with roving threats marks or a lot of differed tokes like dol amroth or others from instances to level all those skills .
its basically a grind system but not a bad one and recently everything has been discounted so that helps to in a way .
star lit crystals are purchased with merit big battles reward from the auction house or can be won true the in game rotary .
the system is pretty simple and on top of that all can be purchased with a lot of turbine points if you have the quantity to spend .
essence and essence gear how and where to get soon .
ps if i missed something i will try to edit in the future but feel free to with comments and i will add it in the post for the new players and returning players to see and understand .
pss for help more information in game help or advice feel free to hit me up on laurelin server on characters storby or definnel i am always glad to help .

so i saw a post on til or dataisbeautiful ca n't remember saying that 1 of reddit has 50 of the karma give or take .
this sounded very similar to wealth statistics in individuals and i feel it kind of reflects the workings of most market industries like there 's only a handful of big companies in each area and then a bunch of small players that fight for the scraps .
at the same time it sort of reflects what goes on in elo systems or competitive systems a handful of committed skillful players dominate the top echelons while most people are in the middle of the bell in an elo system they have nothing to concentrate .
even in the videogames industry in each genre there are 2 or 3 games that dominate each scene with a bunch of smaller players orbiting around .
what is the mathematical name for this type of race towards concentration '' ?
but i 'm not sure it is what i 'm looking for .
i 've been considering an upgrade from my trusty t3i for a while but only recently thinking about it more seriously since i have a few shoots coming up that could benefit from a more modern camera .
a few things about my situation i 'm pretty much committed to staying within the canon lens ecosystem .
i like the lenses i ca n't easily sell them all off and it 's what my network of borrow/lend videographer friends use .
second this camera is for side gigs/for fun projects so i ca n't afford to throw more than 2000 at the most and that would be stretching it .
it would be really nice to be able to get good use out of a new camera for 2 or 3 years at least .
i 've had my t3i for close to 5 years now
third i would use this camera for both videography run and gun event documentary style and for filmmaking so the challenge is finding something that can handle both .
the frontrunner in my considerations is the gh4 with a metabones speedbooster which i believe i could find for about 1500 if i hunt/wait for a deal .
my concerns with this camera is the relative age to newer offerings and the fact that i would still be stuck with a dslr form factor rather than a more video-centric layout .
my pipe dream-but-too-expensive wish would be a c100 mk ii .
built in nd filters audio etc would be wonderful but i simply ca n't justify the expense being that i do n't bring in enough work to pay it off in a reasonable amount of time .
and the lack of 4k and slow motion capabilities bother me as well especially for the price .
flipout full rotation viewfinder love the t3i in that regard
expandability durability quality to last at least 2 years without being super out of date t3i has done quite well for being 5 years old !
still only camera with the killer x3 crop feature that i 'm aware of
aps-c sensor as close to average super 35 film as possible
good menu system easy to use reliable easy to use with canon/3rd party lenses
4k is not as important to me yet but realistically could be very valuable in the future so it is a factor .
body image stabilization would be nice to have but lack of it is n't a dealbreaker .
sorry for the long post i 'm hoping to hear from others that have gone a similar route i 'm sure there 's a few !
and if there are any new/different cameras other than the gh4 that i might have missed that hit the points on my wishlist .
edit maybe i should say the reasons why i want to upgrade from the t3i too since i do still like it a lot .
codec quality and resolution is getting very dated the camera really only holds up in the best shooting conditions .
slow motion options 720 60p is just out of date in comparison to new cameras .
i recently bought a house and noticed in my garage the attached pictures http imgur.com/gallery/g47kr/new it appears as though one of the previous owners attempted to wire the house for ethernet ?
i 've looked all around the house and i 've found a lone jack that appears to be for ethernet not surprisingly in the bonus room almost directly below this rig the rest of the jacks seem to be your typical rj45/phone line ports .
any suggestions or advice on what to do with this equipment would be greatly appreciated .
i 'm actually in it but not really a networking guy and it 's been a few years since taking those classes ! .
the house was built in 2004 for reference although to me it seems pretty clear this was added afterwards .

looking for some good online texts to explain the creation of racism in america .
his plane just yesterday flew from vegas back to san diego .
your guess is as good as mine what do you think he 's doin today while we sit on pins and needles waiting to hear if we have a football team in 2016 .
my money is on making the help act out scenes from braveheart whilst rubbing lard on his exposed belly .
i guess i 'm just looking for validation that i 'm doing the right thing for both of us .
or if anyone has been in the same situation and solved it i 'd love to hear about it .
so i adopted a really great border collie mix named arrow from a local no-kill shelter not too long ago .
i had a bc mix when i was in college who i did agility with and was really looking forward to doing it again .
arrow is the perfect dog for it obedient high energy always ready to learn more .
as you can well imagine arrow needs a lot of exercise and stimulation .
it took a week but we finally settled on 1 hr obedience 2 hrs of fetch 2 sessions and a 5-mile jog .
later we 'd add agility once we got some basic training down .
if arrow does n't get enough exercise or mental stimulation he shows signs of depression and stress .
lately i 've been struggling to breathe during our outings .
i 'd had this problem before on rare occasions but had never thought anything of it .
anyway to make a long story short i found out a week and a half ago that i have exercise-induced asthma .
my pulmonologist told me that sometimes this happens to people who have allergy-induced asthma which i do .
he thought it showed up now because i started doing vigorous exercise every day instead of two or three times a week like i normally do .
he thinks i could go back to doing some of it after several weeks of low to moderate activity .
we discussed treatment options and the cost of the extra meds would eat up my monthly dog budget .
when i told him i 've been using my emergency inhaler 4 6 times a day instead of once or twice he got alarmed .
i 've tried wearing a dust mask over my face to keep the air i breathe warm and wet .
i take a puff of my inhaler 15 minutes before we start .
i also tried adding more fetch even though that is winding me because i get no recovery from activity at all .
i do okay on our walks so long as we walk at a moderate pace and take hills slowly .
as you can imagine this is n't enough for a young border collie mix .
poor arrow has been such a good boy throughout all this .
he 'd have every right to be a terror .
for his sake i think he needs a home where the people are healthy and active .
for my sake i think i need to take him back before i have an asthma attack .
a small lower energy companion dog like a toy poodle is what would be best for me .
somebody already offered to connect me with a reputable breeder so i could get a puppy or even an adult that just makes me feel like i 'm betraying arrow .
he 's not a product that can just be replaced you know ?
oh here shelter person please take this dog back because i found something better . ''
and if i have to return him do i even deserve an adult dog let alone a puppy ?
however in writing this i realize i 'm thinking more about myself than arrow .
it 's all about how i feel what i want how i want to be perceived .
maybe that 's because i feel there are other options that i just ca n't see .
and yet arrow 's pacing around my condo doing the full-body stress shake .
if i take arrow back to the shelter he 'll get adopted within a week probably less .
he 's a mix that 's very popular now .
he walks well on the leash full heel knows all his commands etc .
he gets along with just about everybody including cats and children .
he does n't get on the furniture or jump on people .
in short he 's the dog everyone hopes to find when they go to the shelter .

i know this is a general issue and happens in multiple reddits but it does not have to be that way .
for those who do n't know usually when a noob like me posts an honest opinion on counters balance or strategies in general it get 's downvoted to oblivion instead of corrected .
i understand that noobs with no clue how the game works can be annoying but instead of just flaming them you could tell them something that corrects their misunderstandings .
i myself suffer with anxiety towards posting because every time i post an honest opinion it feels like people stop reading and go into aggro mode when i tell i am in silver league .
posting would be fun but nobody wants to get blamed when trying to express oneself .
also if everyone would be nice to our noobs the playerbase could grow since people in reddits can learn and understand the game by talking with people in reddit .

anybody know who the brunette on the left is ?
so something i noticed especially right after a restart for an update is windows wo n't boot all the appropriate services and programs that normally should boot up .
it just loads the notification center clock and the battery and just stops there .
i do n't see anything else in the tray .
anyone know what the source of this issue is ?
computer is still usable to an extent but it causes issues like how i disable my touchpad when my mouse is plugged in .
it seems most of the posts are civ4 and 5 was wondering why not a ton of the newer one .
oh yeah and by rocking i mean 250 fps i love dem shaders
you can use other emulators separately from retroarch but i like that i can browse my entire collection in one app and that i can configure controls overlays and shaders and set it to take effect across all cores .
to me it would mean that they have tried off the shelf parts found what worked and did n't work and are now creating a headset with custom pieces to fix issues they discovered in the building process .
edit and this is n't me saying one is better then the other just what i think building custom parts would mean .
i just put my snow tires on after about six months on my super sports .
there is a little rear end shimmy coming through the chassis but the steering is dead straight .
my tire pressure sensor says that the tires need to be checked either do to the cold or sitting and deflating a bit but i tightened them down last night with a breaker bar and checked them this morning to make sure they were still snug which they were .
1 are the tires just breaking themselves in again after sitting for so long ?
2 are the tires just under inflated after sitting for so long ?
in her pov chapter it 's revealed that you 're at least partly right all her tricks with fire early on were just tricks using various chemicals to colour the flames and stuff but later on she has real powers as magic is returning to the world again .
and her visions are definitely at least partially accurate she sees the battle on the fist pf the first men for example ... and the shadow babies are a pretty neat trick
its about how naive kids are for idealizing that lifestyle by showing what really happens .

when people see me with my niece and nephew they always ask me '' when are you going to have your own kids ? ''
there 's so much truth in this the thought of going out and finding new friends is as daunting to me as trying to start dating again . ''
once you 're out of school you realize how few organic opportunities there are to just hang out and socialize with other people you have to actively seek out a social circle and organizations/events .
it 's something that creeps up on you too you lose contact with old friends and acquaintances over time you do n't go to social gatherings as much anymore and one day you realize that there aren't any social events and you have n't seen your old friends in months/years .
i had n't even mentioned b12 because it is an obvious one but there are plenty of other health reasons to eat meat .
many people just do better with meat in their diets just as many people do better on vegetarian vegan low fodmap and various other diets .
everybody has different genetics and should experiment to find what works for them .
most vegans believe that killing animals for food is wrong .
we need to accept our place in it not try to place ourselves above or outside it .
what we should all share is concern for the wellbeing of all life especially animals .
they should live a happy life without suffering and their death which is inevitable should be as painless as we hope our own will be .
that is certainly possible but not the norm in the current food system .
true paleo not the 95 bacon paleos you read about in the press and vegans are a lot more similar than we are different .
we could accomplish more positive change in animal welfare together than apart .
yeah it 's on my list of first things to get if i end up choosing the vive .
if we could travel at the speed of light and everyone did it it would just look like everyone was standing still .
were you at all spiritual when you were practicing martial arts ?
perhaps because you were just thinking about how to defend yourself against different attacks this put you in a negative fearful state .
if you were practicing these martial arts but also had a spiritual sense within you maybe you would have had a different experience .
i 'm a pretty spiritual person and find spirituality captivating .
for me the martial arts would just be a part of who i was whilst still maintaining my spirituality at least i hope .
i think if i began to sense a big ego appearing and emotions like fear aggression etc i would re-evaluate what i was doing .
one of the reasons i want to do martial arts is because i do have fear anxiety and all the rest of it at times .
my anxiety has greatly improved over the past year or so but it is still apparent to some extent at times .
i 'd like to think that doing boxing or something will put me more at ease and increase my confidence maybe .
i also need to become more disciplined i feel and i 'm sure it will help with that too .
for me it 's about fitness self-defence and helping me to overcome the fear that i sometimes carry with me .

why does it matter it was an all 'white ' jury ?

an opportunity rapist in a position of authority was caught and tried .

i have never heard of this type of scheduling .
from my experience the classes and schedule are usually determined by the department administration and then the most senior faculty get to fill their schedule first .
the remaining courses are then filled with part time adjunct faculty .

what he said was n't serious at all it should n't be taken as such ideally it should be taken as a bad joke .
your point is n't missed on me though i just think it 's poorly thought-out .
you have to think who you 're making your point to .
maturing as a species is an entirely abstracted concept i do n't think we understand it in the same way either so i really do n't want to muck with that for now .
we should n't ignore this at all not even treat it as a sad fact alone but it has its place and that place is not in jokes or in the image of anything generally like the manner of japanese swordsmen instead it has its place in an understanding of historical anarchy and other studies of society .
personally i enjoy a romantic view of history because without it history just does n't have a narrative it just has a timeline and without the narrative we only get facts of the time and not thoughts or dare i say !
however i do agree but want to expand on your point no one with any appreciation for history or even human decency should find it cool to joke about things that are obviously reprehensible in regards to historic characters and their actions .
edit dark romanticism is probably the genre best used when dealing with our well darker side .
some of our most classic fiction is dark romanticism and it 's a genre i personally believe might see a revival .
it 's really not as good as people make it out to be .

without speaking toward the sensor and never shot a d3xxx series camera i 'm going to assume it 's similar but updated to my old d40 .
the d3xxx series is targeted for the consumer market .
it 's a great camera and you 'll get the same images as you would from the equivalent d7xxx series .
the d7xxx series would in my opinion be considered a prosumer '' body .
you do n't have to go through menus to adjust most of your settings like iso .
it 's weather sealed and has a focusing motor required on af lenses that do n't have a motor like the 200 50mm f/1.8d a great lens for the price .
i 've had the d7000 and have shot professionally with it for a few years .
i 've upgraded to full frame a few months ago .
if you want to do a lot of photography and learn about manual settings go with the d7000 .
you 'll outgrow the d3200 in a few short months and will hate having to go through all the menu options to change the simplest of things .
if you want to just take great photos and looking to save a 100 the d3200 is a fine camera and wo n't disappoint .

personally i consider the throne itself being a boss a spoiler which is why i put that in .
i wish i was n't so lazy and provided some sort of video or gif with this to make it less of a quickly made shitpost of useless information .
if there is one thing you should get out of reading this sub it is to stop caring about your rank .
also when you say you are beyond furious then go on to say you dropped 3 divisions in bronze you sound really childish .
i do n't know about all the nationals competitions but i 'm almost certain the last one was fake .
there was too much hinky stuff going on with the scores like kalani somehow placing 1st in duets/trios they completely cut out kalani and mackenzie 's solos from the episode so they at least edited the episode in a misleading way and the management was so unprofessional that i find it hard to believe a legitimate nationals competition would run their event so poorly .
i 'm sorry raja but violet had only one meh '' look if you want to call it that way .
she also had the confidence and knew how to sell each and every one of those looks .
raja had that messy christmas outfit she made it with crappy materials yes still messy the awful outfit and hair for the makeover and that creepy makeup for the cake outfit while her panties were showing .
violet hands down has had the better overall looks ever in the show .
raglan road at disney springs formerly downtown disney hands down .
also chefs de france at epcott is simply amazing as well .
those two are our favorites when my wife and i go .

god has the money if you are willing to go .
most full time missionaries raise money and prayer partners to support them .
you should see if your denomination has a missions arm and what openings they have .
they will probably help you with resources to raise money or may even have funds already set aside .
i think it really hurt to have eps 3 4 pirated after syfy had pre-released ep 1 .
syfy did the best damage control they could by releasing eps 2 3 and 4 .

after so many weeks i think a lot of people forgot and moved on .

i have no idea why you 're thinking about arena at that rank with a team that is n't even fully leveled nonetheless .
i 'm going to go out on a limb and guess that most of your bastet team is n't max skilled either .
bastet is n't all that viable for arena without courage green puppet and even then it 's pretty sketchy .
once your team is fully leveled completely skilled up and has several 297s that 's when you can start looking at not running arena .
even at that point you 're going to need good rng on your side to even finish a run .
it 's based off of the portal 's attack power i believe .
queen 's 'we will rock you ' https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-tjyn-eg1zk is a traditional part of us culture .

you are thoroughly unqualified to ever tell someone how to behave online .
your multiple appeals to authority aside that theory is not an answer to the question as there are many monopolies that exist today despite the existence of all five forces .

yea seems to only happen for me after a pick 6
vardy is more of a runner positioning and finishing screams poacher to me .
we play an attacking possession-based 4-2-3-1 with a lot of pace on the wings and attacking fullbacks .
we play from the back and it 's important that our cbs are good with the ball at their feet .
player by player we 'll start with the starting xi
cyle larin st canadian wonder kid set a record for goals by a rookie 17 .
really our only consistent threat in front of goal .
he 's a target man and ca n't really create for himself yet .
but even if he 's in a tight space he 'll unleash his cannon of a leg .
the colombian took a while to break into the starting lineup but he 's a projected starter on the left wing for us .
he single-handedly picked apart the red bulls in our 5 goal win in red bull arena
kevin molino am he used to play the 10 before kaka arrived and now he 's been pushed out to the right wing .
he plays an inverted style really more fluid between the center of the field and the right swapping on runs with kaka .
he has the club records for goals in a season 22 in all competitions 20 league
cristian higuita dm he 's our 6 and is an absolute destroyer in midfield .
inter milan was looking at him before we bought him and he 's been a starter since day 1 in mls
darwin ceren dm captains el salvador and plays the 8 for us .
he 's still more defensive than box-to-box but can score from outside the area .
the ceren-higuita combo means we win the midfield battle most of the time
brek shea lb/lm former stoke winger turned fullback he 's one of the most athletic players we have .
had to play up top more with molino 's injury but he should be playing defense most of the year
aurelien collin cb former mls cup mvp with skc he plays with reckless abandon .
goes from being our best defender to our worst at times .
he came on at the end of the year but he really needs the right partner
seb hines cb was promising at boro but came over and was given the starting job after sean st .
his passing is decent and he plays conservatively and makes up for collin 's recklessness .
we 're looking to upgrade this spot but it 's hines ' job to lose
rafael ramos rb former uefa youth league first team all-tournament selection with benfica ramos could be the best rb in the league if he controls his temper and stays focused .
pacey has arguably the best first touch on the team and can dribble around anyone
joe bendik gk we just picked him up from toronto .
he 's competing with young earl edwards for the starting job
earl edwards gk only got one appearance in the open cup before going down to an injury late in the season but played lights out .
hopefully we see a lot more of him this season .
he 's talked about highly by the club and he will have every opportunity to beat out bendik
adrian winter am adds some speed to the right side of midfield .
good on the defensive end which helps when he 's playing with rafa and a decent player .
servando carrasco dm/am a good passer of the ball .
he can play anywhere in midfield but is most often depth at dm .
he did n't make many appearances for us and we wo n't rely on him too much but he 's a good player
david mateos cb came through the real madrid youth setup but never broke into the team .
eventually moved to hungary and was one of ferencvarosi 's best players which i 'm assuming is hard to do as a center back .
he 's easily the best on the ball of our cbs and is a really good 3rd option
pedro ribeiro st if you need a late goal pedro 's your guy .
his position is kind of fluid he mostly played striker but made some cameos in midfield .
really he could play am in a different system and had his best game for the club as kaka 's partner in a 4-2-2-2 .
great to bring off the bench late for some needed offense
bryan rochez st if he had n't been stranded in new zealand for two months he might have beaten larin for the starting job .
as it was he was out of shape and out of sync with the team .
when he finally came on he scored two match winners down the stretch for us that kept us in the playoff race .
his movement off-ball is potentially the best outside of kaka
luke boden lb/lm a fan favorite and former midfielder with sheff wednesday boden came to orlando at 21 and made the change to lb .
only he and kevin molino are left from the original city roster .
he was considered the best crosser of the ball until rivas burst onto the scene .
he could easily start at lb for us if shea was n't in front of him
tommy redding cb hometown kid and us youth national he 's the future on the back line for us .
i would n't be surprised if he 's our 4th cb this season
tyler turner rb versatile defender who can get forward but is n't great on the other team 's half .
made one appearance at cb in an emergency and made a lot of mistakes .
want him to make it but he 's got work to do
harrison heath dm adrian 's son and a good option to have .
turned down norwich and stoke to sign with us .
we 've been linked to a lot of big names but we 're really looking for depth now .
i think we 'll bring in 2-3 players that could make an impact .
our obvious needs are cb gk ? and depth in the midfield and forward .
the club thinks bendik and/or edwards are the answer at keeper .
but we need a veteran forward starting cb hoping for dante in the summer and both attacking and defensive midfielders
it 's under zero client terminals '' so it 's not just a stand .

i have a friend http steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127707842 who would love a copy of this game .
i would love more people to play with and he has only played 1.6 a few times but really liked it .
i think he enjoyed it much more and felt it was an all around better game than cod .

my encounters with psychologists like carl jung and wilhelm reich have lead me to the firm belief that sexuality and human behavior is not necessarily tethered to sex organs .
biology and muscle mass is but the concept of what is and is n't manly '' is a spook .
and it 's a spook so pervasive that both feminists and misogynists use it unironically to describe the same stereotyped expectations of behavior .
this is all just a fragment of the disease that is behaviorism as far as i 'm concerned .
it 's harmful on a number of levels but more importantly it 's a demonstrably false projection .

this is the exact problem my partner and i have .
i do n't get tired or annoyed with arguing to me it 's just a process of figuring things out .
it does n't matter to me if it 's a big thing or a small thing it 's just a neutral process that i usually find interesting and enjoyable .
i 'm still trying to understand why it 's so taxing on him but i 'll probably never really get it .
he 's requested that i drop arguments more often and ask myself does this really matter '' which is actually really helpful .
i still really dislike having to stop debating something just because it 's not important '' but i can live with it .

driving with both feet is a valid way to drive.. obviously riding the brake is going to warp them and possibly light them on fire as well as prematurely wear them out .
i drive with two feet but i keep my left foot lifted so it 's not touching the brake pedal until i want to brake .
left foot braking cuts your reaction time down because your foot does n't have to move from the gas to the brake .

basically most of the stuff has come as advertised .
about one out of ten items have been the wrong version of something and occasionally it just wo n't come at all but that is rare and usually one very cheap items .
we have gotten some cool clothes and the leggings she bought on there are surprisingly high quality .
my advice would be to only get stuff under ten dollars that you 're willing to take the risk on .
anything she has shown my above that price threshold i have been able to find on amazon prime for a few bucks more and sans the absurdly long shipping times on alli express .
i will say she has found dupes of makeup stuff that usually costs fifty bucks for less than a dollar on there it was shamelessly labelled as the exact same product .
i think the website 's general market is for ebay and etsy type sellers as well as counterfeit street and flea market vendors .

ok here 's my experience to give a bit of context to all this .
some years ago when i was pretty much clueless about sex and orgasms and all the rest of it thanks uk school sex ed !
he was n't my first but my previous bf seemed unaware that there was such a thing as a female orgasm and as long as i said i enjoyed myself nothing more was expected .
anyway my bf at uni used to get really upset that i could n't orgasm when we had sex .
i had never had an orgasm in my life and did n't know how .
i would try to explain that it was n't him that it was just how i was but he seemed to have a filter in his brain that turned everything i said into you 're not good enough '' .
so he would keep working away at it long after we had both stopped enjoyed ourselves and after a while it would start to hurt and i would have to ask him to stop .
and to him that would be like a double dose of you 're not good enough '' .
and this went on and on and on and nothing i said made any difference .
so to me there seemed to be only three options i could keep talking and have a permanently upset bf and never get anywhere not an option i loved him and felt terrible for what i was doing to him not talk and be in pain from him going on and on during sex or fake an orgasm .
and it 's a vicious cycle because he would be strutting around for days with this massive grin and if i did n't fake it the next time it would be even worse than before .
i suppose in hindsight there was a fourth option i could have left him .
but the guilt was crippling as i was convinced not being able to orgasm was n't normal and it felt wrong to dump him for something that was i thought my fault .
it 's not something i would do now that i know more about how orgasms work and what i need to do to get one .
i would also have less compunction about leaving a guy if he was refusing to listen to me about something so important .
but for young naive me it seemed the only thing to do .
tl dr communication only works if both people are doing it .
i prefer to just secretly shift player alignment if they do bad/good stuff .
if a neutral player is extremely charitable and i see him as becoming a good person i secretly note down an alignment shift .
the alignment on his sheet stays the same but his true alignment '' is different .
in 5e alignment does n't even matter anyway since classes do n't require alignments anymore and there are n't any spells to detect it either .

this might not be the best place for it but something that 's been bothering me about the piv stuff as posted on the wiki is that gender/sex is n't the only power structure in society .
to me it seems that class trumps basically all other power structures but race/ethnicity is also clearly a big deal across the world .
my question is would n't the same argument hold true for those structures as well ?
are interracial relationships also without true consent regardless of the sex of those involved ?
would n't a difference in economic assets also carry an implication of contract under duress '' ?

once you hit the higher levels of characters like demise and hylia things get way harder as feats diminish to near nothing above that is the golden goddesses which are the omnipotent creator deities by lore so absolutely crush bayonetta obviously .
unfortunately we really ca n't say we know they nearly took over hyrule and it required hylia sacrificing herself to seal them away and a sword created by her before being enhanced by the triforce to actually kill but the same game pretty much states that the master sword makes fights unfair in link 's favour at least based off all ghirahim 's comments about how if you did n't have the sword he 'd happily and easily torture you until you break .
combined with the fact we get exactly one instance of seeing demise in action and that 's against said protagonist armed with the super ultra anti-evil sword that possibly grants in-game pseudo-plot armour so we really have no idea how good they 'd be without all that .
it 's quite possible demise could basically bat aside bayonetta by doing something like throwing them into a pocket dimension they created where magic works differently and it 's quite possible bayonetta can easily defeat them as her feats hit levels way beyond demise we really just ca n't know as demise has next to no feats as mentioned .

the yield is high because the shares are down massively over the last year or so .
when i first saw you i thought you were half stupid but you have shown me to be wrong and i accept you are far more than that .
german here we 're either seen as fat beer drinking lederhosn wearing bavarians or as accurate unfriendly humorless cold engineers .
so when we see you as dumb fat loud uneducated patriotic spoiled brats that try to solve every problem with violence what 's the big deal ?
we all know that this is a cliche but cliches are fun .
so you 're implying that leaving a toddler alone at home is not an act or carelessness but a rationale act ?

you get continually cited for violating local airspace without having lodged a flight plan .
there has been many cases of woman helping pedophiles for either money or brainwashed 'religious ' reasons .
we took our daughter to australia just before she turned 2 so that was a 1 hour flight 14 hour flight and 8 hour flight .
we had 3 adults so the jobs were shared she was too short to kick the seat in front at least .
we used the ipad for awhile and then she really got into this micky mouse video on the inflight entertainment so i just pressed the play button quite a few times .
we also took her to the toilets a few times for a walk and a wiggle by the plane doors space to stand .
this was a couple of years ago so just saying what 's on the top of my head .
we also gave her calpol half an hour before flying to try and help with ear popping .
i have no idea if this actually helped because it turns out that our last plane flights a month ago she did n't need anything to help her ears .

that rockstar intentionally cripples gta online to make shark cards a more attractive offer ?
it 's not a theory mission payouts have gradually been reduced prices for new dlc items have increased and the only measures rockstar implements to deal with hackers are those that prevent money spawning because it hurts their bottom line .
i am absolutely cool with shark cards that enable all of us to get free dlc
rockstar has made over 2,079,480,000 from gta v. they have plenty of money to be releasing free dlc .
furthermore it 's not really free most dlc updates are extremely expensive money sinks multi-million-dollar vehicles 10,000 outfits and so on that are next to useless and can only be purchased if you repeat the same heist for hours and days on end or just give in and buy a shark card .
the dlc is released to help sell shark cards not as a reward for their previous sales .

but ... i want honda to make a perfect track car that i can afford !
i totally agree it is funny seeing people stock up for a couple inches of snow .
prime first hand example i have of poor winter infrastructure in the south was february 2014 in clarksville tn .
there was close to 2 feet of snow overnight and it took roughly 3 days to clear the roads and an additional 2 days before i was told to come back to work .

good point but refugee 's are not full citizens .
the obligation of host countries is to keep them safe not to provide them all of the rights and services that citizens have access to .
if a group of refugees demonstrates that they are almost entirely composed of good people who will make an effort to respect locals there is no reason that the minimum obligation ca n't be extended to allow additional privileges .
if a group of refugees has a large number of people whose objective it is to organize sexual assault gangs something that is a complete anomaly to the host country i do n't see why any host country would extend those privileges .
that would be kind of crazy would n't it ?
haha i racked up around 70 million just today so hopefully i continue like that and finish soon .
what buildings did were you upgrading during your last millions ?
you still consented to the act at the time .
did you consent to the act which you performed ?
there are reasons to think that at least sometimes you did n't .
so for instance if you consent to sex with me but you only do so because i tell you that my semen is magic and it will cure your illness then later you find out that in fact it is n't magic and really i also have hiv i think we would not describe this as growing up and learning from your mistakes . ''
i think you might legitimately say i raped you because although you consented to sex with magic semen man '' in fact the act which you performed was sex with hiv positive non-magic man . ''
because you performed an act to which you did not consent and because that act was sex we might think this is rape .

i recently bought a 'used ' schecter riot-5 bass guitar from a small guitar shop on the east coast through the reverb.com website .
the bass is in immaculate condition and plays so nicely .
i have one major issue fucking the whole thing up however..
the guitar has 'active ' emg pickups in it as well as an active eq .
after less than 1 hour of play the signal starts to distort .
if i keep playing much longer it just dissipates out completely and all the batteries i keep replacing in it lose enough charge to keep the bass sounding properly .
if i let the bass rest for about a day it will play again for about 15 minutes or so then the whole thing distorts again .
i do n't leave the cord plugged into the bass so please do n't think that 's causing the issue
has anyone else had this problem with emgs or active eqs ?
are there any fixes out there that you know of ?
this is basically ruining this beautiful guitar for me .
tldr the bass guitar with emgs eats up batteries in less than an hour and i ca n't play the damn thing like i want to .
the speaker was male and i believe he had white hair .

so today i checked my mail and i got a letter from boa that says my debt of 1200 dollars is forgiven .
the problem is i 've never had boa credit cards or any loans .
my name is on the letter but other info does not match .
it has my name and home address match but the social security number taxpayer id number and payers e.i.n number on the letter is not mine .
the letter goes on to say that i have to include the discharged amount in your income '' .
i am not going to include it b/c it 's not mine it has a different ss number and i already filed my taxes this past monday .
am i legally responsible to claim it as my income since it has my name ?
or am a free from this since it is not my ss number .
i am a bit nervous someone maybe is using my name and address ? ?
i rarely find them and by the looks of it i ca n't buy any from kadala either .
if i use the hands free attachment with the standard glass heating element would n't that combust my herb ? ? ?

for the last couple of years i 've been hard at work creating a new site named tabletop giant https tabletopgiant.com .
it 's been in a 'test ' mode for the last eight months or so and we 've had about two hundred volunteers from the paizo forums test the site .
today we are opening up the site for all to try .
this site is in active development and is being regularly updated however there is significant functionality available such that many will find it useful right now .
i 've written up an article https tabletopgiant.com/news/introducing-tabletop-giant on the site which describes its current features as well as what we are looking to do .
to summarize for the tl dr among you tabletop currently offers a 'level 1 ' character creator complete with 497 archetypes and nearly all pfs legal feats spells and traits as well as means to organize playing groups and events .
it is also free though donating to the site does earn the user a larger sandbox in which to make player characters .
we also have a patreon page https www.patreon.com/user ? u=923655 u=923655 ty=h which i hope many of you will consider .
i hope you all enjoy this site thanks so much !

how do the career prospects look for your major ?
if you 're a cse major do you have a specialization or recommend a certain specialization ?
thank you so much for your time and i appreciate any of your help !
i do n't remember much about this anime i watched it as a kid in the late 90 's though it may have started airing earlier .
i remember the fact that it was about people piloting big humanoid mechas .
i also remember a snippet from the opening credits the screen is split into 3 diagonally in the first plane the main character appears running towards the camera then in the second place another character a girl i think appears doing the same and then a third guy in the third panel they 're all running together maybe preparing to pilot the mechs .
as for the content of the show i barely remember it i think the 3 main characters each piloted a different robot but then another smaller robot appeared and no one knew who the pilot was until it was revealed that it was the protagonist 's brother or something .
also pretty sure the show was dubbed in english .
not much to go on but i 'm hoping there are some anime fans here .

i 've played in a lot of bands some marginally successful most not .
my primary forte is writing and the back end of the industry i 've worked for my dad who is an entertainment attorney/artist manager since i was a kid .
currently i 'm looking to fill out a solo '' pop project .
i play the instruments well enough to track scratch and have some great talented friends in pocket to record the pro versions .
i have a few dozen hooks that need to be fleshed into full songs .
unfortunately i fucking suck at making any kind of beats besides the basic boring i love rock 'n ' roll '' kick-snare coincidentally the only thing i can play on drums and everything i write solo turns into a goddamn folk tune so i 'm hoping someone out there has a few upbeat/dirty/poppy projects they 've scrapped or would be willing to share for some creative collaboration .
i 'm aiming for top 40 caliber with a little more of an edge e.g .
i really love 90s industrial stuff kmfdm meat beat manifesto modern simplistic hooky hip pop '' marc ronson/bruno mars joint macklemore 's downtown '' and a lot of everything in between .
one 's own music links are clearly not allowed here but i can give you a taste of what i 've done if you 're interested and someone please enlighten me as to whether or not that is acceptable in comments before i make an ass of myself further .

planning on brewing this weekend but do n't want problems to come up namely the ones that made me take a break from it in the first place mostly bad beer .
gon na be an ipa with some fruit zest thrown in not sure what fruit yet .
looking for tips or constructive criticism on hop bill balance ingredients etc .
my main motivation for making this beer is that i 've never been brave enough to just say fuck it '' and throw a shitload of hops at flameout .
i 'm not as fit as i used to be and as a result i am still getting used to the tight jeans
313 titan and a 317 warlock doing a sherpa through normal mode .
leave psn name or message the_infanta for an invite .
so after the whole de-rank spree i kept getting bad teammates blame them and play spitfully trying to kick people who were not playing well and being toxic .
now that i have had a chance to calm down a bit the game is a lot more fun .
even when i am going against better opposition i still try and have fun .
i still try of course i have been having 30 kill games a lot recently but that is due to being juuuuuuuust off of where i should be rank wise .
i went from mg2 to silver master p i know i 'm bad .
so lately i have been having more fun lots of top frag games i do n't get mad as much i am trying to loosen up more .
so due to weather i am in early from work .
i just got a new monitor i need to get used to it .
so i warm up a bit then go into comp with one goal in mind .
i get in there and it becomes obvious within two rounds one guy is using a controller .
that guy is having fun right now i bet .
dudes not trying to get salty he wants to have fun right now .
so all throughout the game this guy named chubby and myself just sort of carry the team and call strats .
nothing crazy only one crazy strat heavy round after a timeout so we could make some quick buys .
i notice blue the guy with controller is listening more .
when i call a save or an eco he starts following .
when we finally won our team had two carry rather than the one on their team blue did n't frag hard but he started playing roles .
he would push smokes to act as bate entry for me or purple .
he made an otherwise fun game into a memorable game .
dear people i was toxic too i am sorry .
i had no right to take the fun of the game from you .
kitty you fought with scott in the last installment and one of you died so let 's go over that .
your attempt to distract him by seeing a monster only partially succeeded and your shot to the head damaged him but not enough to kill him .
he flayed you with his knife like a madman and ended up killing you .
you severely underestimated him by only shooting him once when his health was still middling and not even bad .
duncan your tentacles were hurt pretty bad by the madman and you took some damage yourself as a result but you did take care of him despite him immediately trying to kill you .
going up you find kitty 's recently deceased body and 3 scavenging vulture skeletons who want it .
going in a random direction because you 're insane you come face to face with the giant ! ! !
it 's still just as healthy and strong as it was when it was last seen .
crimson you ate the hippopotamus but sadly nothing was really there ... now you just feel an empty pit in your stomach .
in the next room you find a bunch of bats with skeleton heads and a single skeleton leading them all .
i am either a very emotional and sympathetic intj or a very logic-driven and pragmatic infj .
both seem to fit me exactly and i am having difficulties determining which matches me better .
i am aware that everyone is capable of every function i am just unsure as to wether i am a stronger t or f. for years i have identified as an intj and only recently have started to question that .
i am just going to list out a bunch of things that describe my t/f struggle hopefully u guys can give me some advice .
when giving advice or describing someone my tendency is to be very cold and honest yet i have learned from experience it is best to sugarcoat things because i deeply care about how people feel .

hello i 'm a young engineering professional who has been toying with some ideas on the side professionally employed otherwise .
i have spent a significant amount of time developing them conceptually and doing some basic engineering calculations to get rough scale and layout of said products .
there 's 3 or 4 that i 've really thought about but there 's 1 that i actually did some professional collaboration with and have a pretty good idea of the problem it solves .
the product i 'm looking to pursue has to do with the bike drive mechanism and i 'm looking for the right way to make it attachable as a third party accessory rather than something that has to be fabricated with the bike .
the problem is i have no direct experience in machining or putting together a product like this .
how do should i go about finding a bike engineer to help me create this product ?
it could be as simple as finding an experienced bike mechanic but i really think it will be more complex and require specific machining skills to create .
i have some capital and can probably pay for materials and maybe some shop time if that 's what it comes to but ca n't really just straight up hire a designer to do it .
it would be a sweat equity sort of deal .
i would love advice/insight from those of you who have created products that you could n't make on your own at first .
in general what 's the lifespan of a storage array ?
or more specifically we have a dell powervault md3200 purchased in 2011 with 18 tbs of storage .
it 's currently being underutilized and was managed inefficiently by the previous admins .
it basically used for file storage and minor vm use .
my manager want to buy a new san since this one was purchased in 2011 and they 're thinking of implementing a dr plan that will require storage to accommodate a failover from our remote office .
minus the space requirements would this san be up for the challenge and can live for another 3yrs at a minimum ?
what are new san technologies and improvements should i be considering as well ?
send me some love and offers comment offer here or just send it .

i 've always had a decently itchy and dry beard but i decided to grow it out a bit longer than normally probably a little over an inch long throughout .
since it 's winter and my skin is dry my beard has become fairly dry and itchy as well .
my beard is flaking a lot and is very itchy throughout .
i 've read that it 's not good to shampoo your beard regularly so i 've stopped that to about once a week of shampoo'ing it with head and shoulders .
i ordered some leave in conditioner beard balm from amazon http www.amazon.com/honest-amish-beard-balm-conditioner/dp/b009nnfb0o about three weeks ago and had been using it daily but have since stopped as it may have been irritating my face i 'm not 100 sure .
the flaking was reduced a bit but my beard was still very flaky and dry ... so i decided to order some oil .
i ordered leven rose beard oil http www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00ib6iaos/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_3 ? pf_rd_p=1944687762 pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1 pf_rd_t=201 pf_rd_i=b009nnfb0o pf_rd_m=atvpdkikx0der pf_rd_r=13r3jc795bhqmm51wkwx from amazon and have been using it every day for about a week and a half .
after i get out of the shower i dry my beard with a towel and apply the oil generously to my skin and beard hair and my beard is still very flaky even if i apply it twice a day .
do you guys have any other suggestions/oils/conditioners/etc to use to make this stop ?
i tried doing some research on my own but there 's a lot of products out there and i 've already tried two things that are n't working too well it seems .
looking for 2.5 million coins but best offer so far .
the one at the back of my inventory with c9 stickers is not for sale
i only play trade_minecraft_fnaf_v69 and im better than evryone else so y am i best player
just ok intoo but i can hold my own .
maybe we can bitch about certain textures that need updating .
i think we all can agree new customization options are always a plus and i would very much welcome more hairstyle options .
what i want more is tied up hair for undead males .
for a race that is so often paired with the rogue class it should make sense that they would want to have their what-passes-for-hair out of their faces .
the ned stark hair would be cool for both humans and undeads as well .
i read somewhere about undeads and belves having beards but i 'm not so sure on that .
i am playing with this button but i ca n't figure out why the text gets selected when you click it .

do you guys have any recommendations for character kits i could download ?
free ones would be nice but any recommendations are appreciated .
i do n't own any at the moment and i 'm interested in picking some up .
i 'm sure this scene is taken from an anime and this person animated the frozen characters doing the same thing .
i just decided to go this weekend to reserve my copy at gamestop of the special edition of fates but it 's sold out anybody know where else would reserve it ?

i walked into my front room and my big ass dog a mixed great pyrenees/golden retriever was laying on my couch which was just so cute in my state of mind borderline bartard i got down on the couch and cuddled with it because she is a lazy ass that looks and acts as if she was barred out 24/7 seriously if she is in the driveway when we pull in i have to get out physically prop her up to move her out of the way of the car always tends to lay on her side when she eats .

my wife 's sex drive has been non-existent since we had our last kid 2 years ago .
i tried to spice things by getting her some vibrators but she said she did n't like them .
about 3 weeks ago i told her i tossed out all of the toys '' since we never used them we are cleaning out to move .
this week i was putting away some laundry and noticed that the rabbit vibrator i bought her was hidden in there .
she must have taken it out of the bag of stuff we were throwing away .
so my question is should i let her know that i found it ?
should i pull it out next time we have sex and try it on her ?
tl dr found dw 's vibrator that i tossed out b/c she said she did n't like it in her drawer .
here 's a question for you how do we know that chara is the fallen human ?
surely it 's the 'name the fallen human ' menu at the very beginning of the game .
well i believe that i 've found the answer in this long and poorly written theory below .
oh quick clarification before i get too enveloped by my rant when i say ‚Äòyou ' i am referring to the current player of undertale .
if you ever take any part of this as a personal attack please read this part again and know that i 'm both sorry for making you feel that way and that i 'm not the one at fault .
let 's wind back to the beginning before the arrival of the first human .
chara when living on the surface wanted nothing more than to die .
why this was the case i do n't know nor do i care to speculate on it right now .
what we do know is that chara ran off to mt .
ebott as they did n't know how to end their life so they went to the one place where people mysteriously disappear .
from here they fell into the underground met asriel and lived for almost a year underground with the monsters who before falling underground chara did n't know existed .
after living with all of these kind and welcoming people who were trapped underground chara felt sorry for them and wanted to help them before they ended themself .
fairly soon toriel taught them the nature of the barrier as well as how to destroy it .
this got chara thinking and after learning that buttercups were poisonous through a cooking accident they came up with a plan and told asriel it .
asriel not thinking what it would mean to kill a person agreed to take part .
chara would sacrifice themself in order to save every monster .
chara would 've been a hero if the plan worked .
we know that it did n't as asriel upon seeing the humans before him felt pity for them and resisted killing the 6 humans required to break the barrier .
chara pressed for him to kill the people but asriel mistook this sudden press for aggression as a deep and longlasting hatred for humanity and went home without drawing blood .
at this moment chara realised that asriel was n't like themself that he still had a reason to live and to let others live so chara gave up pushing him to take the six souls and remained silent .
the two never got the chance to talk about it ever again .
eventually chara was buried near the ruins under a bed of golden flowers right where they fell into the underground in the first place .
fast forward i do n't know how many years to when frisk falls into the underground .
they are the first human to be mortally wounded by the drop .
the eighth human lying on the surface of the underground was about to join the eternal sleep of the first human lying underneath the surface .
you called out a name a name which brings a part of chara back from the dead .
you use this part to bring the dying frisk back to health .
you puppeteer this paralysed conglomerate with the combined determination of all three of you .
while you dictate what the body does chara watches from beyond the grave occasionally reaching out to talk to you to fill in the gaps of information that you ca n't see for yourself .
you lead a life down either a pacifist or neutral path and chara is content with watching you do your own thing .
at the end of a neutral path frisk has absorbed chara and has developed into a singular entity capable of living on their own .
however if you choose to you can take those two back and push on for a pacifist ending .
at the end of the true pacifist route everyone should feel complete .
by now frisk is fully recovered without having to absorb chara and lives their life on the surface .
their job done you let chara pass into the afterlife where they can finally rest in peace .
finally you should 've walked away from this game pleased that you 've saved everyone you 've seen and one that you had n't and satisfied that you 've gotten everything that you can from it .
rending this timeline asunder you start from scratch refuse yourself with the frisk and chara of a new timeline and use them as a vessel for murder solely so that you can see what happens when you do .
while you mercilessly slaughter everything in your path chara watches on .
they would 've been shocked if they still had their soul .
this leaves chara to try and figure out why you 'd do this to the ones they loved before realising that they do n't love the monsters any more .
chara is fine with you killing the ones they wanted to save in fact chara wants to know what happens when there 's no-one left .
it gets worse as chara believes that you still have feelings for the beings you kill .
that you enjoy it the hunt for increasing attack defence exp love and gold higher and higher and higher .
chara believing how such a pursuit can bring enjoyment then adopts the view that spiritual fulfilment is achieved through spilling blood and dust and praises you for giving them a purpose to exist .
soon your and chara 's essences utterly destroy frisk leaving a mangled entity behind .
proof of this is in the eyes of chara 's sprite they lie vertically on their head not horizontally like a human 's compare this to the eyes of flowey 's final form as well as further stretching down to the cheeks at one point unless this is a black ooze like many believe .
in both cases it 's disturbingly inhuman and twisted .
here 's something that i find to be very interesting to consider .
the 'you 's doing the genocide run who did n't know of chara 's plight and inevitable corruption watch chara 's actions at the end of the game then blame them for killing asgore flowey and in some dire cases everyone else on the path to this end .
by shunting the blame onto someone else you distance yourselves from the hurt that you 've caused allowing yourselves to hold chara in greater contempt .
that 's right your love in this world our world increased at that moment .
finally at the very end chara takes what they consider to be your path to its logical conclusion and offers to destroy the universe .
if you accept the offer chara takes it as a sign that they were right about you utterly .
if you choose not to chara believes that someone else has replaced you asking since when were you the one in control ? before destroying the universe on their own .
either way chara is merely mimicking you trying to show that they understand you and your desires .
so in conclusion in neutral or pacifist routes frisk was about to die but was saved by you and your ability to use chara as either a spiritual transplant or plaster and the game was your method of letting your attempt to save frisk come to fruition .
in genocide the game itself is a mirror which you perform in front of until chara is the only reflection left .
a reflection of the being pushing all the buttons that ended everything .
and if chara takes the form of the fallen human ...
... then who are you to call them the monster ?
the competitive league of legends scene is developing in a rapid speed so it was just a matter of time that teams start to stack up their roster 5 .
just take team liquid as an example with their 10 man roster .
that is completly fine but in which way did fantasy react towards this ?
fantasy used to make so much fun when you had to speculate which of your players will get the maximum amount of fantasy points for you in this week .
at the moment it is just the speculation is this player even going to play 2 games this week ?
piglet for example used to be a highly contested pick during the first draft .
now he is not really usuable for any teams because he might only play 1 of the 2 games and gets half the points or does not play the week at all so you get 0 points .
another problem is that some lcs player have individual problems in their lifes so they do not play one week because they are ill for example .
as a fantasy player you get this information so late that you are not able to react to this and have again a postition which gives you 0 points .
for example power of evil and xpeke merge to one player .
the result would be that it does not matter who of them is playing you simply get fantasy points for both of them .
if a player just plays 1 of the 2 games just double his points of the 1 game
in the case that you got more ideas how to solve the problems please comment your ideas
i 'm struggling to decide how to value a game purchase .

last october i got permanently banned from the payday 2 group and forums due to hacking i partook in back in summer 2014 .
otherwise i was a fair sport helping players learn and generally not being a dick .
i picked up what dlc i liked and did n't much care for the ones i did n't .
however getting banned from the forums banned me from the community which in turn disabled my community stuff some of which was my standard gear !
i want to get back into this game i want to get more fun out of the money i put into buying this game but none of that will happen if i 'm still punished for a victimless crime .
is there someone i can contact that has the authority to revoke the ban and let me enjoy this game once again ?
edit day 16 almir-bro still did n't respond to my e-mail .
but my theory is that since no capitalist enterprise can stand this long without even trying to make a profit reddit is government subsidized for social network spying .
just imagine how much info people share here about their lives ... .
it can only go forward you ca n't steer it i have some ideas for that .
i should also add another set of legs but .. meh .
it 's not very fast and veers off to whatever side the terrain favours .
the bearing closest to the frame does n't move it 's fixed .
the other three bearings move the leg in a circular motion .
the legs go through 4 stages rotate forward push leg down rotate backwards pull leg up .
i think it 's fine a proof-of-concept but it 's quite laborious to build .
looks at phone huh but i do n't see ... . ''
gamma slam a king ar-tyr a madame darkness a stormbringer or a solar sentinel skin .
like nox ai n't even a dude but we 'll put her in this chest so people pay more money for more gems coz they want that kuku skin .
just let us buy it outright or have just lord slashinton and kuku esq .
in the chest not other skins that do n't fit the title of 'gentleman '
how do you guys feel about the other religions in the world and the people that are in those religions .
so i 've been friends with this girl since the third grade so we are really close .
i was in love with her for a very long time but it never came to anything and slowly i have been getting over it .
she 's had a boyfriend for over a year and a half now and i never had a problem with it .
i really thought any feelings i had towards her were gone until recently .
about 2 years ago my friend sara had a fling with my other friend mark .
they never had sex but they did other stuff .
this really bugged me since i still had pretty strong feelings for her and i had to see them together almost every day since we go to the same college .
it did n't last very long though and she meet her boyfriend slowly after .
even though sara seems happy with her boyfriend she has admitted to me that she is still very atracted to mark and they 've had a few tense moments .
they were at a party together and mark started rubbing up and down her leg she did n't stop it
now there has been a few times that they sat together when we were out .
every time this happens there is usually a visual barrier between their lower bodies and me like a table or a blanket i have the weird suspicion they are fooling around under there .
i notice sara 's weird faces and the looks they give each other .
aftewards we were out on the street and they both went to the bathroom together when we stopped by a bar .
now i was high at the time but i could swear they were in there for like 15 minutes .
i was fine when she had a boyfriend i never saw and never talked to but having her fool around with another one of my best friend in public situations like that drives me crazy .
on the other hand i might just be incredibly paranoid and jealous .
also it might be a combination of paranoia and common sense .
so should i talk to one of them and figure whats going on ?
should i just shut up and forget about it ?
i dont think i can stand it going on a lot more it really bugs me imagining my friend fooling around with her .
tl dr i suspect my best friend who i use to like is fooling around with another one of my friends .
they seem to do weird stuff when were together and im kind of going crazy about it .
i 'm locking myself in my comfy ass bed and planning to binge on shows and beers .
while scrolling through the message details on my iphone i noticed that you can view the details of the photos exchanged between you and the person you are messaging .
most of the photos had details like screen shot '' or snap chat '' ...
what does the getpart '' mean in the image detail ? ..
was a certain app used to take it ? ..
i was readng about paroxetine and noticed something interesting according to crazymeds.us
and yes paroxetine interferes with its own metabolism which is why its pharmacokinetics are so freaking non-linear ''
in my lay understanding paroxetine is itself the active drug and its metabolites have little effect .
and in my understanding metabolization is the method by which paroxetine is removed from the body rather than the method by which it is formed into something the body can use .
does this then mean that paroxetine inhibiting the very site that metabolizes it increases its level in the blood ?
and is this why they say that there is a non-linear effect ?
i am assuming by saying the effect is non-linear they are saying that for example 20 mg is disportionately more potent than 10 mg .
linear would mean 20 mg is 2x as strong and non-linear means 20 mg is greater than 2x as strong as 10 mg ?
what would this imply for the number of dosings per day .
would 10 mg 3x a day be less potent than 30 mg once a day for example ?
or would it not matter since it 's not all metabolized at once anyway ?
edit this is the web-site i quoted http www.crazymeds.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/meds/paxilpharmacokinetics toc9
not sure if this is too obvious or i 'm to high
just trying to confirm that i 'm fucked and have to start over .
i currently have lost and found in my quest log .
i 've gone down to the bottom of the pawn 's guild found the tentacles gone up and talked to the pawn dude .
i have n't spoken to ser duncan the guy that tells you to go talk to maximillian .
lost and found is still in my quest log i teleported straight to cassardis ran to the witchwood escorted quina found the hut talked to selene watched the cut scene with quina walking to the village went into the village and spoke to adaro .
here 's the problem adaro does n't want to let me finish the quest .
he just gives me the standard ah back fron gran soren '' line .
his icon is blue if i do n't have lost and found selected or red if i do .
there 's no way to finish lost and found from my current situation right ?
i 'm extremely thankful for what you do because without you i would n't have been able to play the game at all and i 'm sure others are the same .
the same goes to the people who translate the game thank you !
does anyone miss the old days of the monday night war ?
me and a buddy are looking to re-create the monday night war .
hoping theres still a few out there that remember the good old days of roleplaying with the e-feds .

okay it 's not really a treatise but i never get to use that word so ...
my greatest recommendation of dungeon fighter was there 's a leveling grind but the act of leveling is actually fun . ''
i ca n't make that endorsement anymore thanks to scenario dungeons .
this new mode is fun ... the first time .
you level quickly the stories are good the maps vary ... it 's a well done system .
they 're basically an extended interactive cinematic because you have to go afk for awhile in order to die in one of them .
at that point it barely feels like a beat-em-up game because you 're just pushing x to continue .
i was quite excited about the new difficulty modes as even kings and hero modes were a bit 'too easy ' at times even solo .
running dungeons on slayer difficulty feels like my 'sweet spot ' for a solo challenge .
unfortunately if i take 10 minutes and run some slayer mode dungeons i 'm not progressing forward .
sure i 'm gaining levels but i 'll still have to do all of the scenario dungeons for the next dungeon and have to completely finish the scenario dungeons to unlock the next area .
if scenario dungeons are boring on easy difficulty they 're purely tedious when you 're above their level and still have to run them .
by the time i finish a scenario dungeon and can thus do a particular dungeon on harder difficulties i 've gotten so much experience from the scenario dungeon that i 've out-leveled the dungeon i wanted to run as a challenge so i have to go on to the next scenario dungeon to unlock the next one ... and it keeps going .
also i have to go through the same scenarios on each character by which point the story goes from this story is awesome '' to i hate this story '' just because i 'm being dragged by the nose through the whole thing .
also one of the things that drives a lot of mmo players is the feeling of getting better at the game .
you unlock new abilities and then learn to effectively use those abilities as you play .
with stuff dying in one hit to just about anything in scenario dungeons there 's no meaningful progression of skill .
if there 's no challenge and no risk of dying players will learn bad habits that will hurt them when they reach the actual challenge .
so please neople give us the option to skip scenario modes by out-leveling them .
automatically unlock dungeons once a player is in their level range .
let them grind levels in the awesome new slayer mode instead of dragging them through levels where the bosses are as tough as the weakest enemy in slayer mode .
or possibly let us change the difficulty mode on scenario dungeons so it can be a challenge too .
so i collected all pressed flowers and there is this cutscene with henry 's declaration of love the red tulip .
i think i 've seen it like 15 times now and after the cutscene finishes it just says desynchronized for no reason every time .
also before you post check to see if someone has already posted your school .
if they have comment below theirs instead of commenting directly in the thread .
this will give me a better and less confusing idea of how many people are where .
i was playing as austria yesterday and i was trying to avoid the shadow empire .
i 'd like to get good relations with the pope since the pi bonuses are so good for a nation like austria .
the problem is that if i annex the pope core his land and than release him in rome he 's still going to hate me because i have all of his other cores .
should i go to war again with the papal states to make him release all cores in italy and then try to get an alliance ?
if i get an alliance with the pope would be worth to grant him electorate ?
i think that would be a nice way of getting both a secure vote and lots of pi .
so i 've been looking around after watching some of stabbystabbys videos and seeing in the comments that nocrit backstabs are easier to play with and i 've been looking around for any vpks or folders to use .
how do i recharge it to get into the town ?
its my favorite ln and i want to support it .
is there a good or even decent chance itll be translated in future years ?
p.s before you go into these images no offense indented against the pro 's '' especially lassiz or barraccuda this post was meant to share a funny situation that happened to me
a lot of you know me from posting in this sub but my podcast is basically like we hate movies or how did this get made for animation .
this month i 'm talking live action movies based on animated series and the next episode is jem and the holograms from 2015 .
i know it 's sort of short notice but i 'm not sure if my guest will be able to record tomorrow and i could use a backup .
would anyone here be up for watching the movie and guesting via skype if my guest ca n't make it ?
planning to record today around 5 pm pst time zone .
let me know in a pm or comment thanks .
who do you guys recommend i 5 ... hulk captain marvel or angela ?
so i 've slowed down in leveling level 84 because nyx and other events and my gear score is kinda stuck because of cost restrictions 93k .
i was wondering how much cost we get in between level 90 and 105 ?
is it just cost points we can distribute or is it strait up cost that goes into all 4 categories weaps hats armor monsters .
i would like to know so i can plan ahead on cost .
hey internet tutle folks i found a turtle wandering about the street in my neighborhood .
it 's a highly urban area so i 'm thinking it escaped from somewhere .
i 'm assuming it 's young shell is about 4 inches lengthwise .
anyway assuming nobody comes looking for it what 's the minimum requirements for an outdoor habitat ?
so far i put him/her in a 3x5 planter where i dug a small pond for it to chill in and a box for hiding but i 'd like something a bit more permanent without breaking the bank .
i 'm in southern california so the weather is rarely cold .
we 're going to take it to a pet store to identify the thing tomorrow .
i see these cool aquarium deals but he might outgrow them plus the energy costs .
in the spirit of 'all our bruised bodies and the whole heart shrinks ' i want to know specifically the events that tie la dispute to your life .
we can praise their musicianship all day but i do n't think that would even begin to explain why this band affects its fans so deeply .
i want to know what makes them so special because they certainly are n't the first artists to aggressively tackle the subject matter .
for me it was the extreme details in the lyrics i held on to heartache from high school for years .
somewhere at the bottom was so explicitly heart-on-sleeve in such great detail .
it sounds ludicrously self-absorbed to outsiders and it is but that 's what happens to a person losing a person they dearly want to hold onto !
that old flame nearly burned up my first 'adult ' relationship .
i was stuck in the past despite being madly in love in the present .
and we got past that and when rooms of the house released i attached to it differently .
i was n't mourning a lost love i was dreading the possibility of my then-current relationship dissolving .
we took each other for granted and kept arguing and fighting for the other to be this or that way or to be more responsible for this or that .
revisiting 'you and i in unison ' with the perspective of this fresh wound was like a knife to the gut .
so i 've been dating this girl for about 8 months i 'd say and everything was good .
we moved in together and moved to a new city .
when we first arrived i found a job really fast but due to certain circumstances i had to stop working .
i 've been looking for work and had a few interviews but nothing yet .
the city is pretty small and it 's hard to find work .
it has been about two months and i 'm starting to feel really worthless and that she would be better off without me .
i feel like a burden and negatively impacting her life .
sonetimes at night i think about packing a bag and leaving .
she once said she was n't sure if she was the right person for me because she does n't understand what i 'm going through .
i 've been diagnosed with depression and i spent some time in the hospital last year but i 've learned how to manage on my own .
i do things around the house like cook and clean but it 's not enough .
i do n't know anyone here and i just do n't know what to do .

i 'm going to go out on a limb and say the aac is not interested in any schools with weak football programs as it has designs on eventually being considered a p5 well p6 conference http collegefootball.ap.org/article/aac-striving-turn-power-5-power-6 and doubly so because if teams get poached from the aac they 'll probably be among the best football schools in the conference .
so any replacement school the aac picks would have to be near the top of c-usa the sun belt or the mac in football .

i 'm retired 24 years and these idiot 's contacted me right after i retired guess their paperwork was jacked up .
i had alot of fun messing with them since my last 18 years i was a 79s career counselor the next year my son joined the army reserves i played dumb but offered my son the usual advice a son would receive from a retired soldier then i told the recruiter i would be at my son 's swearing in ceremony he acted like he really did n't want me there but i just told him to give me the time and i would be there showed up at meps two hours early recruiter met me at the door said there was some problem with my son 's paperwork and he probably would n't be swearing in that day as soon as i walked in the front door people were jumping up from their desks to greet me shacking my hand offering me coffee poor recruiter was turning white and looking confused because everyone there knew me i handled the reenlistments for this meps for several years and they immediately got my son 's paperwork completed correctly and let me review it before he signed it .
thank you so much i 've searched for this game over the years man .

i can definitely see how my friend could have felt all those emotions you just described .
one thing i am doing better than your ex i think is handling the aftermath better .
after the natural desperate e-mails on the first day i did give him his space i wrote him a long letter a couple weeks later and promised i would n't continue writing letters .
he actually responded saying he really appreciated it and would read it soon when he was in a better mood and even gave me a life update which i did n't think was something you did to people you never wanted to hear from again ... that was the last i heard from him though he did n't even respond to a short happy new year '' e-mail but i am definitely giving him his space .
the only things i send were the letter a reply to his reply to the letter and the new year 's e-mail over a span of 3 months .
he does seem to care and i really hope this is salvageable ... it 's just driving me crazy not knowing for sure .
i know that should n't be the focus though .
as for changing ... i 'm not sure how .
i 'm doing well with the people i 'm meeting and i think i handle casual friendships alright but i feel incredibly lonely without a relationship or a super-tight friendship .
and once i get one my negative behavior of inadvertent manipulation comes out so i 'm not sure how i can know if i 'm really getting better until i get close to someone again .
i keep trying to think of the friendship i had wondering which aspects of my behavior were okay and which ones crossed the line and sometimes it 's hard to tell the difference .
i wonder how i can know or if it differs person to person what they 're comfortable with .
if you 'd like to talk more i 'd be happy to talk to you about your experiences on skype or telegram if you have them it sounds like you have a lot more experience than i with these sort of things .

i 've eaten a lot of taco bell in my lifetime and i used to think this way .
then one night i found the bad taco bell on the poor end of town .
i was happy because my usual order was 0.10 cheaper than normal because it was under a different franchise .
i ate my crunchwrap which was hot and tasted fine .
i also ate my steak quesadilla which was lukewarm at best .
it tasted okay but i 'm pretty sure it was the impetus for my gastrointestinal demise .
i would soon come to regret the trip with the worst diarrhea of my life .
the second day i went to work but felt ill and left almost immediately .
if i had known that i 'd be spending the majority of days 3 and 4 on the toilet i 'd have stocked up on fluids better .
i could n't sleep because i had to go to the toilet so often .
i ended up exhausted and at least moderately dehydrated .
at one point the liquid coming out of me was bright green from bile because whatever was growing in that quesadilla convinced my insides to take the nuclear option .
once the purge was done i did n't shit again for three to four days .
i did n't eat anything else suspicious and i did n't come into contact with anyone visibly sick .
none of my coworkers had anything before nor did they catch anything from me that week .
the only likely cause was the lukewarm quesadilla from the bad taco bell .

i am curious between the difference between anti social personality disorder and autism as it relates to emotions and navigating a word full of other people 's needs .
autistic people can experience sensory issues but not always which are more associate with autism but high functioning autistic people often get accused of being psychopaths because they do n't connect with others emotions and do n't feel empathy in way we socially believe most people should .
they have to learn how to act in order to appear normal and have meaningful interactions according to societies standards .
do you find that social situations exhaust you and you prefer to spend more time alone ?
do you have any sensory issues or anything you find environmentally irritating heat cold rain etc ?

as someone studying for a degree in marketing and publicity avoid letting your children watch many commercials and explain to him when you see a regular '' to you commercial all the things that are n't right and are n't like that irl .

caring more about the consequences than worrying solely about who can get rich or save the most money .
not occupying other countries to control the outcome their resources .
not solely trying to get rich off of the manipulation and exploitation of others .
whether you want to call it socialism or something else it really does n't matter what it is called .
and m-may your dreams b-be f-filled of ... iv d-drips and s-scaples ?
your example is great because as a guy who 's been groped by a woman when i did n't want to be touched and had society laugh about it around me i clearly know exactly how much sympathy to give other people .
when women complain about getting their asses slapped we should ignore them because they want equality .
when minorities complain they should get equality as well .
if you are n't willing to treat people as well as you demand to be treated by society you do n't deserve it .
ooh i thought they were only doing that for end-game pvp .
i know you 've watched lots of videos but have you seen this sam harris speech https youtu.be/2of-it1ug5w ? t=1m35s on objective morality ?
he basically agrees with you that there are certain facts about the type of creatures we are and our requirements for a good life .
but the point is that those facts exist whether or not a god exists .
a god who commands people to behave in accordance with their requirements to live in peace and happiness is simply a glorified messenger .
the facts about what causes human suffering vs. happiness will still exist even if god disappears..and so the basis for morality still exists also .
a god literally adds nothing to the equation other than the promise to punish immorality after death..rather than in this life .
the newest update has made it double my heart rate when i first check it then it almost immediately fixes itself but it has had me at a higher heart rate overall since the last update and it 's always about double what my actual heart rate is .
i 've had this thing for months it was very accurate since the beginning i know how to wear it correctly and i do wear it correctly but that last update killed the poor thing .

i do n't think any company would tell an employee a month ahead that they are being fired .
why would you want a disgruntled employee around the office for a month .
they might tell you that they wo n't be renewing your contract but if they 're firing you just turn up for work and do nothing what are they going to do fire you again ?
so many people donated even though the max roster in the game is 25 !
that sounds like citric acid in the pee hole .
you are just supposing a deterministic universe is inherent in an idea of god .
i say that god can exist without determining every little detail of our futures .
i do n't think i 'll be destashing anytime soon .
the palettes that contributed least were the ud vegan palette and the bare minerals magic act palette .
udv has half baked which has a lot of pan showing .
i may destash it if i finish that shade .
but it also has a real shade a like and reach for a few times a year .
i almost added that to my imaginary palette but was being honest and do n't think i 'd buy it as a single so i excluded it .
the bare minerals palette is my go-to palette for weekend or longer trips .
it has two blushes a bronzer which i love in my crease and a highlight .
it 's strength is n't shadow but i still love it .
i wonder how many shades i listed from other palettes could be closely duped by monarch or udxgwen though .
like half baked could be replaced by the gold in monarch .
other browns and variations on taupe can be substituted for with some mix of grays and browns i 'm sure .
the green and blue-brown from comfort zone and all the cranberries from revealed 2 would be missed though .

my grandmother had severe alzheimer 's and before she passed there were a lot of moments like these .
in the past her and i did n't get along too well .
i remember i was feeding her and she started to cry .

i wish i could have been a better grandmother but you have no idea how hard it was to handle your grandfather 's death .

bronn was substituted for ilyn payne back in season 4 when ilyn payne 's actor had to leave the show following a cancer diagnosis .
the scene where bronn helps jaime learn to sword fight with his left hand was originally done in the books with ilyn payne .
so since jaime 's adventure in the riverlands in affc was alongside the mute executioner when jaime was rerouted to dorne in the show it made sense to include bronn .
in fact not including bronn would have been weird .
all the dog show meta solutions should now be up and complete .
just checking when you are saying you are trying to fix the itunes rss do you mean trying to fix the podcast list on it ?
because i subbed and it only has episodes 36-45 and i would love to have the rest .
the doge looked at the monkey and birds for a moment it was not what he imagined bringing back to a king but the rule were clear the larger number of kills win not the more prestigious marco took his crossbow and exhaled as he aim for the monkey .
sorry to break your stereotype but from actual sources you can see brits have on average better teeth than americans and also visit the dentist more often .
you can buy omnipods from other variants of the same mech and change your hard points .
say the timberwolf prim has one energy and one ballistic in the left torso you can buy the timberwolf a left torso and put it there to get three high mounted energy hard points .
you can go to the mech lab and drag off your side torso it 's above the critical slots and replace it with something .
the trial ebon jaguar is not optimized as it only uses the default config which is generally bad for mwo .
the trial mechs with c are better suited to matches than the 4 clans that do n't have it there are only 4 champion clan mechs right now so the other 4 are sorta filler until we get more .
lrms are okay for the most part but do n't neglect your aim with lasers and srms and maybe ballistics later ppcs are just bad right now so only use them for novelty/nostalgia .
laservomit meta is just getting about 40-50 damage worth of lasers with a preference for large pulse lasers over er .
i think what you 're asking is if there 's a general discount code associated with this sub ?

how does brago 's flicker ability interact with dreams of the dead 's exile clause ?
it seems like dreams of the dead would perma-exile anything you brought back with it that you tried to flicker with brago but then i could see it going the other way since brago 's ability also exiles and specifically says the creatures then come back from exile .

the fact that you felt the need to point out that he 's not a hero makes you sound bitter .

if you need a place to vent or talk there are others there that may understand what you are feeling and going through .
if you need to take some time from your sister that 's okay .
compassion fatigue is a real thing and it can be difficult grieving with others or handling their emotions with your own .
after my mom 's funeral i could n't talk to my father because it was always about my mom .
my sisters and i never talk about her together and it 's been a couple years now .
regardless you are allowed to have boundaries and you do n't have to carry her grief and your own if you do n't want to .
pain and heartbreak are not okay reasons to lash out and project your emotions either .
do what you need to do so you can grieve and move on in a healthy manner .

it 's very hard to look at russia without a bias because if you look at it critically you can be accused of pro-americanism and if you protect it you 're closing your eyes on corruption low level of life and other issues .
that 's pretty much sums up what 's wrong with r/worldnews discussion .
so if you are critical you are pro-american but if you protect it you are a blind idiot .
i am not so aware about low level of life because i lived through perestroyka and 90s so my standards of what low level '' means do not allow me to call what we have now low '' .
and to be honest today 's level of corruption is pretty manageable comparing to 20 years ago .
because how r/worldnews portraits russia has nothing to do with reality .
i live in a decent place but everyone make it like i am a drunk starving idiot in a rusty shack just because i am russian .
it 's truly naive to expect from russia to turn into norway or finland
why people want russia to turn into something russia is not ?

try to open a usd savings account at your aussie bank i recommend commbank and xfer maybe 3.5k over carrying the other 1.5k in cash with you .
right when you get there set up your bank and start the xfer it will probably take you 5-7 days to get it all sorted and receive the money .
the reason to open the usd account is to get a better exchange rate walking around with usd and changing on the street will almost always be a better exchange rate than through the bank .

my view on this as a german is obviosuly a bit different tho especially considering that great germany was actually a concept for a german state basically the borders that ended up as germany in 1871 together with austria borders drawn along the line of where german is spoken excluding switzerland https upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/german1910.png
the kind of rhetorics trump especially employs would just be utterly unviable .
it is the kind of rhetoric that would be immediately associated with the npd or even the nsdap .
if a german politician would be succesful on a similar kind of rhetoric you would have endless articles of is germany drifting into fascism ? ''
that said this kind of ultranationalism is also really contained to the far far right in germany effectivley stifled since ww2 .

how can i try to live as myself here without upsetting my parents and how can i deal with them whenever they confront '' me about being trans because i 'm kind of wanting do have nothing to do with them again .

the problem with gamemaker is that the program itself compiles the games ' assets like sprites into huge unworkable sheets for the sake of efficiency .
just download update 19 or get your hands on a copy of wasteland kings .
there 's no rules on the distribution of mods for wasteland kings so if we clean up the code we can do whatever the hell we want with it .
it does n't sound fun to recode 75 updates . ''
it might sound like a daunting task but it 's really not .
the first three stages of the game were finished in wasteland kings sans the bosses and the first six were completed by update 19 .
most of the game from that point on is balance updates audio and visual updates fixing and breaking daily runs and new characters .
mechanically most enemies are carbon copies of one another .
there 's really nothing special to their behavior with some exceptions .
for example buff gators track their shots crow men fly and elite shielders teleport .
other than that they all follow the same general formula .
if you do n't focus too hard on making the game look pretty you could easily get the game to its current stages in about one or two months depending on how determined you are to see it through .
so this is something that 's been on my mind for a while .
from using it i 've cured my depression and anxiety completely .
i have seen my life laid out before me outside the bonds of time and this has revealed my true purpose in life to live selflessly and help to rid our planet of mankind 's destructive egotistic ways .
i love sharing all these revelations with my close friends and family as well as with strangers .
lsd has also made me realize unity that we all live despite our best efforts in the same beautifully infinite reality .
most of these understandings started coming to me after my one and only bad trip i will ever have .
before said trip i had tripped around 15 times .
i was incredibly happy when i was tripping i was the person i always wanted to be it reignited the flame of passion and fascination i had locked away in childhood .
however these effects only lasted during the trip and in fact increased my mental disorder in between trips .
it was not until my bad trip did i know this .
i began to experience intense anxiety and fear over nothing 30 mins in to the trip .
i with people who i love in a place that i love .
the whole day i fought these feelings tried to ignore them or distract myself and it was n't till i had been lying on the floor for 5 hours trying to sleep when i had had enough .
i finally realized that the entire bad trip was my fault because of choices habits and excuses i have made in my past .
i realized i had been using lsd to disconnect from my reality because i did n't like it .
this next point may sound confusing but i understood that i did n't like my reality because it made it easier in the short run yet harder in the long run .
i was emotionally disconnected from people i had friends who were complete strangers so i did n't have to deal with the stress of intimate relations and then i had nobody to help me deal with myself nobody cared enough to help because i did n't .
so i lied on the floor and deconstructed myself .
i let every experience i ever had come to me and i scrutinized it .
i questioned what lasting effect these memorable situations and choices had had on me and i asked myself could i have done better ? ''
i realized i had all these massive regrets even though one of my life rules is no regrets .
this inconsistency in my mind and life came from me not trying to live a non-regretful life in the moment .
having said all this i truly believe i understood these concepts because i intended to .
more accurately i intentionally allowed myself to stop blocking these thoughts from entering my mind .
then i began to look closer at the people around me .
i saw that some of them had not seen any of this and in fact ran from it if i tried to talk to them about it .
these people just so happened to be the ones who were addicted and live more selfish lives then compared to others .
i realized that they choose these lifestyles and used chemicals to ignore this fact exactly like i had done before my bad trip .
it was only when i intentionally let myself see the error of my ways was i able to .
i was not receiving love because i did not give love .
before my bad trip drugs acid included were having a negative effect on my sober life because of my intentions when i was high .
therefore in my opinion i was tripping the wrong way .
it was n't until i changed my intention to complete acceptance self-discovery and permanent suffering-alleviation did these things occur therefore making this method the right way .
i think we can all agree that if there is a meaning to life that it is the same meaning for everything and everyone .
as the sub reddit dedicated to acid i feel like it 's important if possible to come to a general consensus on these kind of questions or at least ask them .
happy trails i 'm sorry if i confused any one haha

gilgamesh may not seem like the same guy from ffv but if you read his bestiary carefully and pay close attention to the cutscenes involving him and the final battle with his true form you may find that not only is he the same gilgamesh but type-0 is chronologically his first appearance in the series .
gilgamesh is a l'cie warrior and the current king of genbu he had a right hand man in enkidu but when a coup was attempted enkidu lost his life in the attack .
the first thing to note here is the history in type-0 this gilgamesh and enkidu were childhood friends they were children in genbu and grew up together .
so already this indicates that this gilgamesh did n't go anywhere or come from anywhere he 's not some wanderer from the rift he did n't magically appear kidnap a little boy and name him enkidu then proceed to conquer a nation he was born and raised a member of the royal family .
well ffv gilgamesh is an interesting character because he 's always implied to be withholding his true potential this is one of the things linking him to type-0 's gilgamesh as the entire reason the coup occured was because gilgamesh refused to show his power having a thing against displaying his strength .
in genbu only the strong are permitted to rule if gilgamesh did n't show them his power then he had no right to the throne save for right of birth and to many in lorica that just is n't enough .
so the coup takes place and is thwarted but at the cost of enkidu much to gilgamesh 's sorrow .
later on we find that the people of the militese empire have already struck lorica destroying the genbu crystal with an ultima nuke we even get to see the scale of the calamity and it is nothing short of impressive in scale and scope .
during the attack it was gilgamesh who was right next to the nuke trying to defuse it before it went off now remember this is a magic infused nuke or at least something so powerful that it 's comparable to tzar bomba in destructive scale .
this leads to the second clue we have that type-0 gilgy and ffv gilgy are one and the same he tanks this thing and survives .
now it could be said that his armor had more to do with it that and him being a l'cie and while the black tortoise armor is amazing high level players can still do damage to gilgy while he 's wearing it .
his l'cie powers give him the ability to summon barriers and have a thing to do with barrier magic and summoning swords and so forth but the important thing to note here is that in the type-0 universe l'cie might as well be eidolons because they 're equally powerful if not moreso .
so gilgamesh surviving a magical nuke at point blank clearly indicates that he 's immensely powerful powerful enough to thrash the milites empire alone if he so chose .
during this attack the genbu crystal was destroyed and gilgy forgets his focus .
when you finally do meet gilgamesh he 's lost his mind and is wandering the battlefield looking for powerful foes in mid-game it should also be noted that he 's suffering from confusion status during the entire fight .
gilgy is strong his attacks can easily cut the player 's healthbar down in 1-2 hits and he takes zero damage unless you use breaksight .
once you unlock his bestiary entry there are a few things to pay attention to .
the first is that his specific bestiary entry actually has a zoom function it 's the only one that lets you zoom in and when you do you 'll see that one of his eyes is scarred shut .
this is a direct parallel to pirate king gilgy from ff11 who is implied to be the same person despite being human .
if you look at concept art of gilgamesh in type-0 it shows him without his helmet and you 'll clearly see that he just looks identical to pirate king gilgamesh he 's just younger and his hair is better kept .
so already we have a clear resemblance to pirate king gilgy from 11 but let 's take this one step further .
during the third playthrough you unlock the right to fight true gilgamesh these are one on one matches with him .
if a party member is defeated they 're kicked out of the rift and their weapons are confiscated and replaced with joke weapons if he is defeated the character gets their ultimate weapon .
for his eight armed form the black tortoise armor is now sporting several new arms though whether these are mechanical or actual extra appendages i 'm unsure as the armor seems to have been designed with these extra arms attached in the fight .
however let 's back this up to talk about gilgamesh 's l'cie status .
in the fabula nova universe l'cie who fail their focus become c'ieth or monsters those with an exceptionally strong will can avoid turning to stone the eventual fate of a cieth and become the undying powerful cieth with a relentless hatred for all life .
gilgamesh is a l'cie in the type-0 universe and more importantly the rules of the fabula nova universe still apply here there are several references to l'cie becoming cieth and so gilgamesh is n't an exception to this rule .
when you fight him though he has n't lost his mind okay he 's sillier and he now has a weapon stealing habit but he 's clearly quite sane .
my theory is that gilgamesh did become a cieth much like the undying but through sheer force of will he turned the powers of cieth into just that more power .
in ffv gilgamesh is clearly cited as being a sort of fiend or demon but in 11 he 's obviously human .
what happened may be this gilgamesh bypassed the process of becoming a cieth by remaining in a half-state between cieth and l'cie through his own iron-will .
this allows him to casually transition from one form to the next freely meaning his eight armed form is a semi-cieth form that just looks more human because he ended up turning the powers of a cieth to another layer of his own powers this is further proven by how many undying have extra appendages usually in very inconvenient or weird places .
in type-0 gilgamesh suffers quite a bit more than any man should think about it his own reluctance to display his power pushed his people into trying to kill him and ended up getting a close friend of his killed .
then on top of that he had to watch as his great power was proven useless when his country was turned into a giant crater by outside forces and suddenly a bunch of rogue heroes bring him to his senses long enough for him to try to retain some sense of purpose only to be defeated by a person he 's testing .
gilgamesh by ffv clearly developed a sort of heroism is only for the worthy '' philosophy that carried on throughout every appearance he makes .
in every game you end up fighting gilgy he 's a powerful wall of a character who tests the heroes out type-0 finally reveals the reason behind this he 's trying to see if the hero is worthy of continuing their journey without failing .
in gilgamesh 's mind if they ca n't defeat him while he 's holding back they have no right to hold a sword hence why he confiscates their weapons .
my theory is that type-0 gilgamesh ends up in the world of ff11 then later he begins transforming to become more ciethlike but his own iron will stops the process cold resulting in the demonic warrior we see in later installments his eyes are both functional now he sports a set of horns and he 's become more eccentric either as an act or an effect of his half-cieth transformation and he now employs kabuki acting in his fighting style .
so from type-0 to 11 he tries to settle down live peacefully and is successful but ultimately he ends up finding his way into another world in exdeath 's employ .
by this time he 's taken to hiring faithful sidekicks '' and he wears a mask to his his facial features it 's very likely that he may have appeared in 12 after 11 as his newest version of enkidu in 12 is a rock wolf and he 's shown later on to have a considerable number of these creatures at his disposal meaning he was actively and clumsily trying to fill the void in his heart left by the long departed enkidu the only enkidus we see in 11 being the golem creature .
from 12-5 he ends up in world 14 where he tries once again to replace his faithful sidekick with an animal this time a green chicken/flock of them .
we know for a fact that 13-2 despite being ambiguous as gilgy 's canon definitely takes place after 5 because he uses a sword modeled after that version of enkidu .
this leads me to believe that the entire reason that gilgamesh even takes on faithful sidekicks that he names enkidu is because he 's trying to replace the close childhood friend he lost in the coup .
if you look at ff type-0 gilgamesh you get a lot of explanations for the behavior of his other appearances .
finally though the most clear cut clue that helps further that type-0 is in fact 11 gilgamesh and that 11 gilgamesh is in fact the same gilgamesh that has appeared throughout the series is actually a quote from the guy who explained gilgamesh 's backstory .
gilgamesh came from a village of powerful warriors or so he 'd said .
well lorica is a village city of powerful warriors the people of lorica are exceptionally large exceptionally strong and a force to be reckoned with hence why the militese empire tried to destroy them all as quickly as possible .
anyway food for thought nothing was ever outright confirmed but a lot of work was done to emphasize that type-0 gilgy is the same gilgamesh including the use of his dissidia theme in type-0 and in dissidia 012 there was a special costume you could acquire for him that utilized his genbu uniform it has a zipper in the back however so it 's still ambiguous
this is my summary of why type-0 gilgamesh may canonically be the same gilgamesh from the rest of the series as well as cementing that 11 's gilgy is also the same guy and 11 takes place just after type-0 .
i bought a couple of boxes during black friday and now i just want to get rid of everything .
i can also do a mix and match type of deal or if you buy more than one i can throw in a discount .
i recently acquired a roland jp-8080 which is a pretty sweet analog-modeling desktop synth .
i have a korg microkey with a usb midi connection and the jp has a standard 5-pin midi cable .
i also have a scarlett 2i4 that i can use to connect the jp to my pc with reaper or something similar but i 've had no luck with that yet .
i received a used dvd set in the mail and used a damp paper towel to clean the discs/dry them afterwards but they still are n't as clean as i 'd like them to be .

this is n't any sort of personal theory about the hound just what i have observed .
sandor reminds me a bit of frankenstein 's monster .
he looks hideous he is large and brother to a fearsome fighter and so the kingdom would believe him to be a brute with no other hobbies besides killing .
when everybody sees you as something you are not you start to become that thing .
maybe i 'm not wording this as well as could be done but you get the point .
another comparison to frankenstein 's creature is the names .
sandor is known by the name the hound '' a name that connotes loyalty and ferocity but his given name sandor is quite gentle and elegant .
in 'frankenstein ' the creature is called monster and is cast out from society not for who he is but for what he looks like .
the creature 's true name is adam for obvious reasons but a pretty unintimidating name .
both characters are looked down on by the societies they try to inhabit for what they look like and what these people assume their character is .
it is shown with both that they can be understood .
in frankenstein the creature befriends the blind farmer dude who likes him well enough until his family tells him what the creature looks like .
for sandor he seems to nurse a soft spot for both sansa and arya in his own way .
his instinct to protect them shows that he is at his core good .
there is a lot of talk about good and bad and the grey areas between in asoiaf and with sandor there is certainly some grey areas .
he has killed on order from the king and others he was once joffrey 's personal ‚Äòdog ' and he did kill mycha .
however i am confident that this brute this killing machine is not the true sandor but what the people around him made him to be .
of course this all started with his brother and i think it will and should end with his brother .
cleganebowl would not only be awesome but it would take sandor 's story in a full circle and be cathartic for both the readers and the character .
and to be honest i do n't think sandor will survive it .
gregor is now ser robert strong which i think is safe to say is true and animated and strengthened by some sort of magic or alchemy .
while sandor is a large man and a good fighter he has sustained some injuries and can not compete with this monster of a brother .
in a fight i would say his best bet would be to out smart robert strong whose brains which were nothing noteworthy to begin with are likely addled by the reconstruction process .
this could mean that beating him in combat would not be as rewarding for sandor as he would n't really be beating the young boy who burned his face but a shell of that .
but suppose somehow the mountain 's mind survived qyburn 's rummaging about with his corpse .
it 's such a good well rounded fan theory that i just really want to see it come to fruition .
it would be a relatively simple and pure fight in contrast to these large sweeping battles we have seen involving so many different factions and complicated allegiances .
two men who have been at odds since they were boys that represent two different sides of those fighting in westeros .
those who have been swept up into this combative world and had to fight and kill to stay alive despite their true nature and those who thrive in this environment .
for sandor to defeat gregor would signify that there the struggles going on in westeros are finally leaning towards an end .
or at least come to some sort of climax .
thank you if you read the whole thing please comment on your opinions on sandor and gregor and the whole cleganebowl theory .

it 's something that have been bothering me ever since i started playing .
i 've done some research but have n't found an answer .
it seems realistic that they can move vertically though .
i just landed a new job making more than just 10/hr and i 've decided i need to really bite the bullet and get a hold of my finances .
i 'm working on the first step in the 'how to handle ' link on the sidebar .
the excel spreadsheet i decided to use is this one https docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv ? key=0akuptkxcfzjjdg00sdjzr0tzy1rirxhqr1non2d0r0e usp=sharing pli=1 but i 'm not married to it and can use another if that 's recommended .
my paychecks right now are different every two weeks and i was able to change it to be able to accept a different amount for the first and second paycheck of the month .
i do n't think this 'll be much of an issue though once the new job starts .
i put in my monthly bills and their due dates and it automatically puts me negative whether or not they 've been paid .
in fact there 's no way for me to differentiate the ones that have been paid and the ones that have n't .
i also put in the debts that i have .
i want to put in the minimum payment and due date but again it just shows me more in debt .
can i not put in the amount and date until i pay it ?
i 'm also trying to start this right now but was paid 3 days ago and have already exhausted some of those funds .
should i just put my entire bank account balance as my first paycheck ?
it 's still going to show me as negative especially if i put the monthly payment of my debt which i have n't paid because i ca n't .
tl dr i 'm trying to start a budget and get a handle on my money but i 'm just so damn confused and could really use some help .
edit if it will help i 'd be glad to post the current balance of my bank account debts new job pay rate etc .
i just really am tired of living at home and i need to learn to manage my money .
edit 2 here is what my monetary situation looks like now .
i still owe a total of 8,435.35 and the interest is 16.08
15th car payment 150 note my parents paid cash for my car i owe them around 5000 but they are n't making me pay this until i get a little more on my feet .
also i owe a little under 2000 to de'vry for one bonk ass class that i hated and got out of there .
that was over a year ago and i 've pretty much ignored them since i have n't had the means of paying it .
i should also add that i did n't pay the other school payment this month because i could n't and the phone bil and car insurance are already paid for the month .
lastly my new job is going to be full time mon-fri 9-5 .
i 'll have full benefits/401k and starting out at 18.50/hr
i 've never built a gunpla kit before but i really want to get started with an ew heavyarms .
is there anything i should know about the hg i.e .
are heavyarms still being made or if i 'll be ordering something from 20 years ago if there 's something horrible about them i should know about etc .

this is related to my last post but a question about a different kind of gadget ...
they make this system that comes in two parts one for the girl and one for the guy .
the guys part is a hole with virtual skin and sensors that record the movement being made inside of it and the girls part is like a vibrator but it has motors that can reproduce the movement made in the hole part .
so they guy can use his fingers or penis in the hole and the girl feels the same thing in her .
the data is sent over 3g between cell phones and the two different parts connect to the cell phones with bluetooth i think .
so it 's not technically sex and the guy and girl do n't ever see or touch each other they do n't even have to be in the same building or continent for that matter ...
now i 'm not married and i 'm interested in whether or not this is okay before marriage as it 's not really sex at all it 's more like sexting but i 'm also interested in your thoughts and opinions on using this type of thing if you are married .
we all love to get high and have a good time .
here 's an example of someone who took it way too far .
prerequisite/disclaimer i 'm an atheist and do n't believe in any high power or spiritual matters due to lack of evidence .
i went through a period of dxm abuse spanning a little over a year .
i was at a point where without some kind of chemical suicide was very likely .
nothing but a year chalk full of drug abuse and isolation mostly revolving around dxm weed alcohol and cigarettes .
basically i came out on the other side a full-blown 'schizophrenic ' .
i was convinced that i was living in a machine that stars were our dead ancestors and could talk that everything everyone had ever said to me was meaningful and had led me to my spiritual awakening .
i thought that god had given me visions of rebirthing and reincarnations .
that i 'd been shot through the tunnel or tube that everyone experiences upon death .
the rebirthing is a cleansing of the soul and i was able to glimpse this process and retain myself .
i began to hear the voices of my predecessors .
chiming in on all of my life decisions and happenings .
it was comforting to know that i was n't alone .
that somewhere out there my spiritual comrades were watching over and guiding me .
i started seeing messages sent just for me in everyday objects .
road signs billboards.. when people would speak i would dissect their words and discover hidden meanings .
they were angels all around me guiding me i just needed to listen and decipher their holy message .
when i would walk around i noticed that peoples ' faces would become angelic demonic sometimes distorted .
why was all of this being revealed to me ?
my awakening was a sign that i was about to fulfill my destiny .
i could haunch down with my head between my legs resting on my feet and tap into the core .
it would reveal to me where to go who to help and what needed done to preserve the balance between good and evil .
i knew my calling and no one was going to stop me .
my behavior started to deteriorate into what i can only imagine would appear as a total mad man .
i was dueling serpents when they would spawn trying to ambush me .
one night after a nasty encounter with the evil snake i was in my back yard smoking and air force one flew right over my house .
i knew that i was receiving national recognition for my endeavors .
i knew that the higher ups were connected to the spiritual realm just like i was .
they could feel the spiritual strength emanating from my homestead and were congratulating me on my victory .
my behavior began to get worse and worse and soon i could n't even communicate with my fellow beings .
i was convinced that people were just acting appalled at my behavior but secretly knew that god 's work was being done .
as angels they had to maintain an image of ignorance .
a few close relatives began to voice real concerns and after a psychotic break late one night i was taken to the hospital .
i spent multiple stays in the in-patient psychiatric ward and was interviewed by many therapists .
i had a team of three psychiatrists they experimented on me with a bunch of different medications .
and to be honest i think the medications only made things worse .
that 's when they began doing electro-shock therapy on me .
i think there were 27 ect sessions in total .
it had weird affects on my memory and i 'm still paranoid that it fucked me up somehow .
i guess the moral of the story is do n't be a fucking idiot and stay high on this shit for years at a time although i 've never been so happy and felt as much purpose as i did when i was fully convinced that i was a warrior of god ...
i can totally see why the religious delusion appeals to so many people ..
i meditated took a cold shower and squeezed in time to play guitar before work .
i had a lot of energy today as well .
hoping for day 6 to go just as well .
i 've noticed some pretty dank memes from momo art somebody should do the rest of them .
we can use the command s/oldstr/newstr/g to replace all occurrences of oldstr '' with newstr '' in the current buffer .
but is it possible to filter out matches of oldstr '' that are part of or linked to a syntax group e.g .
the manual method confirmation flag s/oldstr/newstr/gc is slow and tedious on large files so i 'm hoping to find an generic automated way of accomplishing this task .
the goal is to substitute all occurrences of oldstr '' with newstr '' in the current buffer as long as the occurrence is not part of a comment .

hello everyone i am a teacher at a high school in brazil and i need some help with my situation
here we have a different system to calculate the marks of a test and its questions which consists of assigning values '' to each alternative of each question .
question 1 which one of the following are male names ?
so as you may have noticed each alternative has a number before it indicating it value '' following a system of powers of 2 .
in this case the right alternatives are 1 2 4 and 16 .
so the student must sum 1+2+4+16 and write the result on his answer sheet 23 on this case
besides if the student does not choose all the right answers but only a part of it like 19 on this case he will receive a mark proportional to the number of right answer there were and how many he chose .
but there is a problem if the student chooses a wrong alternative he will lose the whole question .
what i need is a way so i can have in the first column all the right answers on the second the student answers and in third if he got the whole question mark only the partial mark or if he lost '' the whole question .

'' i do n't look asian black hispanic arab enough to face the bad kind of attention .
this post is partially aimed at gathering thoughts and opinions and insight in to if a mod like this is even possible and if it is maybe inspire someone to attempt to create it .
i am no modder and have limited knowledge of modding but i have seen what modders are capable of making and witnessed some amazing feats by the community as far as showing what is possible .
having said that my idea is to have a flare/glowstick as a droppable '' item similar to that of construction components that could be quickly assembled and stored in the players inventory .
the player could then have the item and just drop flare/glow stick out of their inventory on to the ground .
the real challenge i think is that the inventory item would have to be made as a light source similar to an interior light .
for what i can remember there are three specific types of light sources in se one being a star environment light a block i.e .
i would imagine that all of these types of light sources in se are handled slightly differently as far as the code .
in the cases of a block or character energy '' is required to power the lights .
where as in the case of a flare or glow stick being a droppable item they would not have a power source but a maximum life '' determined by max floating objects ?
while i know we have the all powerful helmet light i just think it would be a nice game mechanic in specific situations .
lets say you are in mine far from base and you run out of juice no power .
instead of being stuck in a pitch black environment .
you could drop a glow stick that would emit light for a long period of time at a low intensity or a flare that would emit a more intense light source for a shorter period of time .
additionally the mechanic could work in other situations loss of ship power exploring ruins or hunting sabroids at night whatever .
now i am well aware that there would be some challenges with making this type of mod and i am not even sure if it is possible at least to the extent that i envision it .
which is where the more experienced community members and modders come in being that you probably know best in what the possibilities are .
is something like this even achievable is there an alternative or better idea ?
lastly if you think this is a good idea and should be included maybe a email to marek would do the trick or better yet a hand written letter !
anyways have at it se community eat this idea alive !
sorry if this is against rules as i 'm asking for recommendations but not on vendors or anything .
when buying stims mostly 3-fpm i prefer to put them in gel caps and swallow .
i know eyeballing doses is a very bad idea .
i 've looked around at scales but thought you guys may know something i can get on a budget just so i can be consistent .
i 'm lv 17 i tried asking bardon and blake but they do n't have it how do i get it ?
i 'm putting in a new turbo today but just wanted to double check i am applying the gaskets right before i put it in .
the gaskets have a shiny side and another side i 'm guessing the shiny side faces outwards ?
i have some cheap ikea shoe trees in a couple of my nicer pairs and have been looking to upgrade .
recently i 've seen a lot of people posting pictures with nicer shoe trees the ones with the flexible metal center .
had a couple dip out due to real life could use some replacements
i hope this is the proper way to go about doing this but it seems like a pretty specific subject to be looking for .
do you know of any books or series that have magic mostly dealing with spiritual or religious faith it does n't have to be completely as that might be hard to come by .
i 'm looking for the main characters to either be or be friends with paladins clerics etc .
i 'm not religious myself but i find the idea of it very interesting to read about in a fictional setting .
for example in elizabeth moon 's the deed of paksenarrion the main character has a bit of a fascination with paladins and that 's all i 'll say in case you have n't read it and are wanting to .
i run a 4-3 defence and was wondering who you guys would start 85 clay or 85 derrick johnson ?
looking to do some role-play or have a discussion with anyone interested in my cock fetish .
the discussion could be with a female who agrees bigger is always better .
alternatively praising a man for being better than i am because he has a few more inches .
all conversations can be demeaning if you want to take it that way or not .
it can be a fun conversation about cocks or it can be a role-play where a large cock man dominates me .
do n't forget to submit your pound-for-pound lists ! ! ! !
please see the stickied post to send yours in .
my friends have an 18-month old and twins on the way .
they own a 2004 saturn vue at the moment but are willing to sell it and get another vehicle because even if they can fit three across in the back row it does n't feel as safe for them as having a bigger vehicle with them spread out .
is three across inherently less safe than having three rows with one child in one row and the other two in the other row ?
have any of you tried three across in a vue ?
they do n't have car seats for any of them yet the 18-month old is still in his infant seat but needs a new one soon .
so they asked me and they have all the options in the world .
if they get a new vehicle it would have to be used and under around 8000 and reliable .
they like the look and crash ratings of the '07-'09 saturn outlook they have only ever owned a saturn but would be willing to consider an expedition-sized vehicle or even a mini-van .
i 'm curious if they got an 8-passenger outlook and put the 18-month old in the second row middle seat if they could still fold down the other second row seat to reach the twins in the back row ?
they want the children to be rear-facing as long as possible and honestly just want to choose the safest option for them as far as which vehicle they choose which car seats they choose and which configuration in the car would be best .
do any of you have any advice for me to give them ?
i hope this makes someone 's night ... just got back from a walk to check out the snow and found a samsung phone just poking out of giant drift .
despite being found caked in snow it 's still working just fine !
pm me if you think it belongs to you .
phone was found on new hampshire between t and swann .
the phone finally rang.. it was the owner.. and the phone has been returned !
hey there guys i¬¥m not it or in tech support i¬¥m a~~n ennemy user but i like this sub .
i¬¥ve read a couple of threads about stupid loops that mail gets stuck in and here¬¥s my little grain
my boss is kind of paranoid not totally to his fault really so whenever i get an email he gets a copy automatically this was set up since the guy i replaced started the position .
6 months ago he goes on vacation and asks me to set up an autoreply to say that .
i¬¥m no it but i know a little and have some google-fu so he usually asks me for stuff like this before trying it which is fine .
due to his weird version of outlook i couldn¬¥t set the autoreply myself and then i asked it to do it for us .
not long after this my email gets the fritz .
i can still receive mail but can¬¥t send it it just stays there in the outbox .
i asked it for help and they never quite found the problem after days and days of trying all sorts of fixes including reinstalling all of office and some stuff with our mail service .
i was forced to switch to thunderbird in the meantime which somehow worked .
we had suspicions the problem had to do with the theoretical loop that would happen if i sent my boss an email he would get it then i would get the autoreply and because he gets a copy of everything i get he would get it back again and so on .
what confused us it and me is that this should have been a problem with the mail service but somehow only outlook took the bullet since thunderbird seemed to work fine .
as i said before they never found a solution to the issue which one of the guys thinks was due to a corrupt .dll file that was impossible to eliminate completely other than to format the computer and star over clean .
at first i didn¬¥t want to because my computer had these certificates that let you log to our car manufacturer¬¥s vpn .
this thing is so delicate that in will only let the account in the pc where it was installed to use it .
if you lose the certificate somehow you have to pay 10 to get a new one reissued .
it¬¥s not much but it requires an international bank transfer so we don¬¥t like to ask for them very often .
the certificate was of course set up in the account of the guy i replaced which i used at first but then was given one of my own so whenever i need to log to that vpn i had to switch users .
i finally agreed to reimage the pc and upgrade to win7 in the process the computer originally came with 7 but was downgraded to xp for reason i don¬¥t remember .
this was about a week or two after my boss had come back so the autoreply had finally been put down .
my mail was working again and i only lost some stuff after the reimage including spider solitaire damn ! !
but we¬¥ll never know what the hell actually happened .
i 'm looking to do a podcast for my store and looking for what people enjoy from their favorite casts .
other than topic or content what are the best qualities you enjoy ?

i love it when 50 of my gpu is used .
honestly 20fps on a drafting screen is my favourite thing ever who needs smooth frame rates ?
posted this in the post-game thread but am hoping to spark some discussion .
might be a bit incoherent so apologies in advance .
we looked pretty tired tonight and it sucks melo might be injured again but i 'm thinking we 're getting to that point where something has to change very soon .
on the coach i 've been giving fisher the benefit of the doubt and i think he 's been improving .
but the question becomes ... is his improvement fast enough for front office and the fans ?
in my mind fisher has shown some flashes of brilliance but then there are still moments when we see something obviously bad e.g .
there was a game recently where he should have clearly pull calderon and put in a guard that plays defense .
i 'm going to continue to give fisher the benefit of the doubt because i think phil is working with him and he has been improving .
i also think a mid-season coaching change would send the wrong message to players throughout the league especially fas this off season .
it is better to look like we 're incrementally improving and have stability vs. our front office looking like they do n't know what we 're doing .
on the pg problem the biggest obvious hole is our pg problem and everyone knows it .
here 's my not great but fine ok we need to do something '' idea .
and by all means it 's nothing new we sign wroten until the end of the year .
of our big men to a playoff-bound team in need of a big s remember we have willy hernangomez coming soon too .
we include calderon if possible and a 2nd round pick if we have to .
someone posted this trade http espn.go.com/nba/trademachine ? tradeid=hl2oao3 and this trade http espn.go.com/nba/trademachine ? tradeid=h7f6d38 .
i 'm not in love with either lawson or jennings but lawson is non-guarenteed in 2016 and jennings is ufa after this year .
this gives us some time to see if wroten and lawson/jennings can mesh with the team this year ... think of it as a half-season audition .
if wroten or lawson/jennings bust we 're not stuck .
in fa we can then go after the best fa pg we can get which is probably conley .
i 'd like to believe that our front office has n't done anything re pg because it 's a little more complicated than we think .
maybe they are trying to sign someone off waivers and do a trade .
maybe they are going to call someone up from d league but want to get a trade done first .
i 'm hoping we can make some kind of pg change sooner than later because we 're more than half way through the season and we need to know if we can make another pg work .
if we can find a better starting pg now we can try to keep them next season and then we may not have to go after conley .
we can then use that fa to sign someone else perhaps a better fa and maybe look at getting a better-and-younger-than-conley pg the season after .
why not allow everything to be in the buy menu ? .
etrae 's still at his bat mitzvah so i retain control of the amateur hour box .
just like the other daily discussion posts talk about anything related to the topic obscure characters and canons but also win some stuff .
but not the good stuff you 'd normally win .
characters fandoms and canons that do n't get enough attention on this sub whether they be completely obscure brand new or just generally unused .
1 page of search results on www is the cut-off not counting huge group/team battles that only add the character for completion 's sake .
contests change from week to week by picking from a pool of different contest types .
this week we have two new contests of my own design which i will detail below .
contest entries should be posted in reply to the designated comments .
winners will be chosen at some point monday morning the cutoff is whenever i first check reddit .
if you win you will be notified in the early afternoon .
discussion can stretch the qualifications for obscurity above but contest entries must match them .
so here 's what we 're gon na do to celebrate choose an obscure character and describe them as somebody would if they were a mysterious entity unknown to science .
for instance superman is n't a superhero from krypton he 's an anomalous extraterrestrial being who displays the ability to fly via converting solar power into some unknown type of energy ...
please mention the name of the series your character is from in your entry .
if two people do the exact same character only the first will count .
pick an obscure enough character and then through the magic of your ears find a song that you feel describes them or fits them in general .
a rap a tv show theme an orchestral piece or this ?
no this is n't just an excuse to ask you guys to recommend music !
try to explain why/how the song fits if you wan na win !
the song can not be from or associated with the original work the character is from .
song length does n't matter but it should be more than like 30 seconds yeah ?
please mention the name of the series your character is from in your entry .
if two people do the exact same entry only the first will count .
you can however put the same song with a different character or give a different song to the same character .
my lawyers say this is not a good idea .
instead i will send you a hilarious picture of a koala .
rewards i will draw or photoshop a picture of anything you want scouts ' honor .
did you post an obscure character post this week that did n't get noticed ?
link it in the comments and i 'll put it up here .
the best overall post will get the sub 's free sticky slot from monday to whenever .
i do n't have the authority to give these out guys .
instead uh just be jealous of mine i guess .
i have a sandisk sd card and it stopped working .
when i would insert it into my camera or computer it would read for a second then disappear like it was ejected on the camera it said it was corrupted and would n't work .
i figured the best way thing to do was to format it and then see if that solved the problem and then recover all the info .
so i formatted it and now it 's working again .
but i can not figure out how to recover the pictures .
i found a couple softwares but they 're both out of my price range 30-70 .
is there a reliable free or cheap i can afford 15 software that would do the trick ?
i just saw him on bill maher recently and i know i 've seen him before .
now r/politics is posting about alan creating a bill that heavily supports bernie 's plan for universal healthcare .
although it also mentions alan is working on becoming senator in florida .
alan grayson joins bernie sanders ' move for free college tuition http floridapolitics.com/archives/199320-alan-grayson-joins-bernie-sanders-move-for-free-college-tuition
yea no ... i do n't have one and no one else does .
do n't bother every possible theory you can think of has already been said a billion times .
just stop with these crazy theories and stop thinking no one else has ever thought of your theory before .
first of all thank you my used armour '' question have been well answered this is a great community !
now this before asking here i have looked a lot i mean a lot to find plan or patterns to make my own padded hood throat protection included to wear under my houndskull helmet and i did n't .
do you guys have by any chance a site that gives a pattern plan or explain how ?
i 've only found so far found one without the throat protection ...
the president had invited danco into his office after his appointment to the position of colonel and now the two men stood face to face .
my word you 've come a long way from that backwater have n't you ? ''
danco tell me what is it in life you want most ? ''
well tell me one last thing what is it you think i invited you here for ? ''
because i called you to my office for one reason to see you . ''
do n't think your ambition has n't caught the eye of those above you danco .
and like that with a wave of his hand danco exited the room intrigued and bewildered .
the president and danco had gotten to know each other at this point and danco was getting to him finding what made him tick .
he liked loyal men strong men in the political sense .
they went to lunch for a while on this day .
rene tell me what brought you to such brutality earlier this year ?
it is obviously controversial that you decided to open fire on the miners in july .
i think this could and has held serious repercussions on your government .
are you fearful of the army at all ? ''
the army is my tool and i will use it as i please . ''
tell me why do you think as you say you 'are the army ' rene ?
what makes you stronger than those below you ? ''
to quote the athenians the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must . ''
well i think now is a good time to end this lunch colonel .
danco retreated back to his home as if it were the abode of a snake and he plotted and schemed .
mr. president i believe your ideals are flawed . ''
tell me why then do you think this ? ''
because to command the loyalty of an army is harder than simply holding a position .
i believe you must command loyalty by respect and respect by example .
in short the leader of the nation must lead the national army in equal part sir .
it is what countless monarchs did and it is what all leaders should do . ''
perhaps you are right danco ... over the past few weeks i think i 've grown to trust you and your suggestions .
if you will i am holding a meeting in the near future and any plans you may wish to hand over may be considered at that table . ''
danco was happy with himself but he lusted for more .
he strolled in on a sunny day to his new office which formerly belonged to the now-jailed colonel luiz and he sat down .
danko asked klaus to hand him all the documents of importance regarding the west sucre military district he could find and set off for the presidential offices .
he walked down the many halls before he found and swung open a large double door into a well-kept room with simple yellow paint on the walls and a large table stretching from one end to the other of the rectangular meeting place .
there were all sorts of various military and economic officials of the government at this table .
ministers and soldiers there 's so much wrong with the state of this country i ca n't work it out .
we 're in inflation up to our necks the people hate me and we 're having serious issues with the structure and bureaucracy of the army . ''
i suppose the first one of those we should address is the scope of the army and its machinations .
danco rose my staffers and i have been working on a reworking of the army and its branches for some weeks now .
we propose something that may seem odd to some of you and bizarre to others .
we propose that the military and civil authority combine into the body of the office of colonel-governors so instead of the military informally running the show we really do .
mr. president there 's no such thing as civilian authority in the state and i think you 're keenly aware of this .
so why not just delegate the power into the hands of the military officially instead of keeping a facade up ?
these 'colonel-governors ' would of course be appointed by the authority of your office that of the president and as such would ultimately rest in democratic hands . ''
you make a good point colonel cochabamba but would n't this erode the power of the senate ? ''
we would act as if you will martial authorities with all the rioting in the streets as of late we 're needed to keep the peace .
if you 'll excuse me i must go to the restroom sir . ''
danco then got up and walked down the hall to the toilets .
some real martial authority could be just what this city needs .
i 'm a traditionalist and i 'd say that the respect for the army has eroded among the people for a long time around here .
well sir to me it seems like a reasonable idea not much is in the times we live in considering the instability of our state ... ''
i think i 'm pretty set on this then .
... by decree of the office of the president and the rule of the people via the senate the state of bolivia hereby is reformed into districts of military governorship .
the previously mentioned districts shall maintain the borders of the previously exclusively martial military district boundaries .
as well the state of bolivia is hereby placed into a state of martial law and emergency due to the increasing instability of ''
danco switched his tv off and went over to the phone to call klaus .
the president has declared a state of emergency and we 've procured the governorship .
danco hung up and went to his front porch and in the morning light of 10 am he stood proud happy with what he has achieved so far .
my boyfriend and i are both having the same issue since the update .
the launcher keeps loading the login prompts and the play button remains grayed for presumably forever but i do n't have the time nor the patience to find out haha .
anything political but looking for video clips of the candidates making controversial statements ... .
me and my ex were together for over a year before she broke up with me last year we both cared about each other so much and we had been through our up and downs .
we were in a ldr usa europe for a while but that did n't stop us for growing our love for each other we got to meet and had an amazing time together and made us fall even more in love in the month we lived together .
things were on track to spending the rest of my life with her .
months after the first meet up things started to get rocky and we both worked our best to fight to get things back on the right track .
she eventually let me know that she had fallen out of love with me but still wanted to fight to regain her old feelings and keep everything together .
after 3 months of doing our best she could n't take the pressure of her life school work etc etc and trying to keep up with us .
her decisions broke my heart obviously and left me in ruins especially after all we went through and all the loving memories i had of each other .
she told me time and time again that she never wanted this and that she hated the situation she still says she still cares for me and never wants to lose me from here life .
i on the other hand ca n't imagine a world without her since we connected so well but its been a month now and i 've been fighting whether or not i should just cut her out of my life completely or just keep my distance while i wait for things to get better but both of those thoughts scare me so much .
i do n't want to just leave here on her own cause i know how much stress she is under and i want to be there for here like a good boyfriend should but that 's the thing .
i 'm no longer her boyfriend and i feel like i need to move on .
i feel like i have cried and screamed and hurt long enough .
i asked her one day out of desperation for a grasp on everything if she honestly felt like things could every grow between us again and she said that a small part of here believes so and that 's why she does n't want to lose me from here life .
she is afraid that breaking up was a mistake but i do n't feel like its fair for me to wait for something that might not happen .
she is so busy honestly with her schooling that at this point i do n't blame the girl for leaving me she gets home and goes right to it with homework still late into the night she is running on low sleep i 'm sure but at the same time i still feel like i should be mad .
i 'm pretty much a mess right now i wan na get over her but i ca n't cause the what if '' is holding me back and i do n't want to make a mistake .
tl dr my girlfriend of a year broke up with me cause her daily life is very stressful but does n't want to lose me from her life and the what if '' of things getting better in the future is keeping me from moving on completely
nathaniel rode to a secluded part of the misty and ethereal forest near his homestead that he deemed to be tranquil enough .
after hitching twig to a sturdy oak he set a fire for himself and his companion and set to roast a creature he had successfully reaped earlier in the day .
he sat in silence for a long while taking a few deep breathes when needed his nose was prone to stuffiness in this time of the year and watching the dance of the flames gentle in appearance yet unpredictable in both form and function .
he pondered for a short while about the fickleness of a flame .
in one instance it could be the crux of his survival providing necessary warmth food and delicate beauty .
in another instance it could lay to waste his home the forest or the precious life of a poor soul as was the case with his father all those years ago when nathaniel was a boy burgeoning into the early cusp of manhood .
not a day had gone by since in which he did n't think of his carelessness in holding the lantern or the cowardice of his delayed reaction to its fall and his indecisiveness about how to best handle the budding inferno .
such thoughts were finally allowed into the forefront of his conscience for the first time in over two decades .
he swallowed harshly the seasonal affliction also brought about a damnable itchy throat .
he turned to twig and remembered the trusty horse as a young foal a present to the young nathaniel that was to be kept hidden by his late father until the proper day .
however the rancher who had sold it to nathaniel 's father decided that it would be best to give twig to the boy earlier than planned considering the tragic circumstances .
nathaniel 's thoughts went to the countless rides he had taken on his horse for a number of broad reasons almost every one being both unremarkable yet unforgettable as a mosaic of memories .
he remembered the time that twig broke his ankle or whatever the name for a horse 's ankle might be on a particularly rough and muddy trek through these very woods .
somehow twig had still mustered the strength to fight off a ravenous wolf that had been apparently stalking the two for quite some time while nathaniel searching for bandages in his satchel barely had time to react and retrieve his rifle .
he also remembered the time as a boy when he and twig beat the loud-mouthed dale rodgers jr. and his horse in a race to the nearest town .
as a reward nathaniel rode twig to the river and the still-young and playful horse decided to swim across which scared the still-mounted nathaniel half to death .
once on the other side twig had conveniently remembered that horses are naturally fearful of water and nathaniel found a great task in trying to get the foal to cross again eventually opting to find the nearest crossing which increased the estimated length of the trip home by at least an hour .
looking back to the fire and then the stars above nathaniel thought of his wife .
after rubbing his eyes the allergies irritated them he turned back to the roasting animal over the fire and decided that it was fit to eat .
removing it from its spit he set it on a platter he had brought and said his graces then pushed the plate to the side .
reaching into his satchel he pulled out carrots and apples and fed a good amount to his friend one by one ensuring that the horse was full before he ate himself .
twig ate the treats with much delight as such a barrage was rather uncommon to him .
nathaniel then set his attention to his own meal but for some reason upon seeing the roasted beast next to the fire he suddenly lost his appetite and instead began to feel unexplained melancholy first then great guilt over the pointless murder and mutilation of the simple animal .
he prayed to god for forgiveness and proceeded to bury the creature .
at home nathaniel 's own boy was fast asleep dreaming of being a young sheriff protecting his town from the scariest and meanest bandits and outlaws in all of texas .
nathaniel 's house was a modest yet pleasant one .
it had a room for the boy a room for him and his misses and a large space connecting the two which held the kitchen dining table and fireplace .
over said fireplace was nathaniel 's most prized possession a genuine photograph of him his wife his son as a toddler and his steed .
nathaniel worked very hard for a very long time to be able to afford having a family picture taken and was one of the only people for several towns that was lucky enough to have such a thing .
nathaniel 's favorite memories were as follows riding twig for the first time and feeling one last gesture of love from his father meeting his wife at a horseshoe tournament where she beat him in the final round and as a result forced nathaniel to teach her how to ride twig and witnessing the birth of his beloved baby boy which brought him closer than he ever had been to tears .
to him the photograph over the fireplace was n't a symbol of the money he 'd earned and spent but represented what truly made him happy in life and what he was truly proud of as a man .
his wife charlotte dressed in her nighttime blouse was sitting in her chair in front of the fireplace with her arms crossed facing the front door .
she stared at the fireplace but her mind was elsewhere .
she looked up to the family photograph and her mind grew more and more clouded as she looked .
the handsome young man sitting her husband 's chair finished slipping on his boots and left thinking of how lucky he was not to have been shot dead that night .
as he left without a word charlotte began to weep .
nathaniel looking up at the stars thought back to that moment an hour ago when he 'd returned home after working a few towns over to find his wife in bed with another man .
upon witnessing this he acted calmly almost to an unnatural extent while his soul began to deteriorate from the inside out .
he went directly to his cabinet fetched some rope apples and carrots then immediately set out with twig into the forest .
the woods seemed to be more still than usual this night .
nary a gust of wind to blow the branches and even the animals seemed to be quiet for the most part .
the grass scrunched beneath his boots as he walked over to his longtime friend .
he pet the beast for a little while and his mind ran back through all the places it had been earlier in the evening the fire that killed his dad his injured horse and the close-call with the wolf and the fatal gash in his heart brought about by his unfaithful beloved .
he imagined himself reacting more quickly to the fire and calling his father before it grew to be too large .
he imagined himself being more careful with twig on a muddy road having the bandages more on-hand and having his weapon nearby to ward off the wolf himself .
he imagined himself not working so much paying more attention to his wife and not losing her to someone younger .
in all situations he saw his failure to act sooner as the catalyst to the infernos that wrought his life .
in nathaniel 's eyes he was a failure of a man and it was n't until tonight that this became clear and prominent in his mind although in truth it had always been in the back of it .
he stopped petting twig and smiled at the horse .
he undid the rope from the tree which held twig there and pushed him off towards home .
twig had gotten out several times before and gone further in those times than nathaniel went with him tonight yet always managed to find his way home .
nathaniel trusted his friend to make it home from here and after a sturdy hit to his hind twig left nathaniel and eventually did make his way back to the homestead discovered in the morning by nathaniel 's son .
after releasing twig nathaniel removed the rope entirely from the tree and held it to his side .
he began to notice and enjoy the faint sound of chirping crickets throughout the forest .
he sat back down by the fire and remembered the long process of teaching charlotte to ride twig and the gentle warmth in his heart that grew in proportion to his time spent with her .
he also looked back on the time they moved into the house together and how passionately they made love every sensation a product of deep expression of that feeling .
and then he thought of her making love to the young man she was in bed with .
he thought about his boy and pitied the child for having such an incompetent insecure father .
he remembered the various times he 'd gone camping in these woods with his son teaching him how to hunt and sitting around fires with him .
his son was tough and spirited very sharp and quick on his feet qualities which nathaniel wished he could see in himself .
although he rarely explicitly stated it he was proud of the boy and was excited to see the man he would grow up to be and loved him more than anything in his life .
nathaniel stood up at this point and took one last look around the woods before his departure .
he took in the smells of the grass and the air and oak the sight of the peaceful moonlight upon the forest and the sounds of the few chirping bugs all throughout .
after climbing onto a decently high and strong branch he then took the rope threw it over the branch tightened a knot onto it then fastened a much more macabre and sinister knot to the opposite end .
he decided to finally accept his inner weakness and let himself cry .
he cried over guilt regarding his father 's death .
he cried over putting twig in danger all those years ago and forcing twig to save both himself and nathaniel .
he cried over the ultimate loss of his family to a strange man whom his wife apparently found to be superior .
in his emotional display he remembered a conversation he had with his father around a campfire many years ago .
then promise me something son. his father then took a deep breath and gathered his thoughts .
i want you to be strong and that means doing your best to solve your own problems and no crying over little things .
that 's something your granddad told me when i was a boy .
he told me that if you cry it 's like you 're letting whatever problem you have beat you .
because when you cry you do nothing to actually solve the damn problem .
it 's like admitting that you 've got no way to solve it .
that 's why children do it because they 're helpless .
nathaniel 's father smiled at him and in that smile nathaniel knew how much his father cared for him .
now here was nathaniel crying over twenty years worth of regrets and shame in one sitting .
this one was a hearty cry and for the first time in decades nathaniel wished for his mother and father to comfort him but that was impossible now .
with this realization being the absolute final straw nathaniel slipped the noose over his head and around his throat .
he prayed to god one last time and hoped that he would be understanding .
he apologized to his father for breaking the promise he made all those years ago around the fire .
he did n't fight it very much and made hardly a single noise as his life was slowly being squeezed out of him .
at this moment the sun finally began to rise over the horizon and nathaniel watched it .
he felt the warmth of the sun admired the orange glow that the woods and the sky adopted and listened to the soft song of the morning birds as he admired the smell of the morning dew thinking again to happier times with his father his horse his wife and his son .
i really do n't know if you guys can help here but i 'm really desperate and i need help with this problem .

i use the tri-slosher a lot and i am almost certain that the tri-slosher is always a two-hit kill .
however i recently saw this video https youtu.be/baobdv9hr10 that dude posted and there 's a tri-slosher with one damage up main and two subs .
now this could just be a thing for one person but it got me curious .
are there any legitimate reasons for a tri-slosher to have damage up ?
i wonder if we run amok or go into blood frenzies as often as we used to .
yea shit post do n't upvote but i have pb reps from ali and they 're 9.5 and fit pretty snug with a tiny bit of room would a size 10 in zztop fit good ?
i had this book for 11 years before losing it a few years ago during some moves .
i bought the book from my elementary school library in 1999-2000 in one of those sales where they get rid of old or damaged books .
the book was hardback felt like it had fabric over the hardback material but i do n't know that it ever had a dust jacket or anything .
the cover was illustrated with i think either a tower or the man in the moon or both .
the book was a purple-maroon color possibly a faded dark blue the way dark blues and blacks might fade with bleach but i 'm pretty sure it was the purple-maroon color originally .
some stories i remember but ca n't find exactly on any searches
a poor man lets some elves/fairies eat the last of his food bread and cheese and they repay him by placing a coin on his oven that always is replaced when you remove it .
i think it flies in from the window or something .
he becomes rich and marries a woman who is different from the other villagers i think from another town/city .
she is vain and washes her face in milk to keep it pale while other villagers wash their face in cold water to keep their cheeks rosy .
the wife does n't like that no one has ever seen the elves/fairies so she sneaks up on them one night and they disappear and take the money leaving the man and wife poor .
a man sees these fairies dancing at night either 8 or 12 and thinks one is incredibly beautiful and describes her features to be like the moon and so forth .
he ends up kidnapping her to be his wife .
she becomes very sad and either stops talking to him or tricks him into letting her go .
a girl is given 3 presents which she opens when she needs help from i think her step mother who makes her do ridiculous things .
i think she helped an old lady who gave her the presents .
one present was opened when she was told to make a cake and the box contained a giant cake .
the last box had a man/prince in it to take the girl away .
there was one about the man in the moon a man built a tower to reach the moon and i guess he ended up stuck there .
somewhere in the book is an illustration of the tower and of him in the moon which was a full moon and a smiling face with crinkled eyes .
it 's also possible i 'm combining 2 stories but i 'm not sure .
version of clever tom and the a leprechaun '' ?
a boy finds a leprechaun and gets it to reveal his pot of gold .
the boy knows he ca n't take his eyes off the leprechaun or it will vanish but the leprechaun eventually tricks the boy into putting him in his pocket .
as soon as the boy does this he realizes what he has done and the leprechaun has disappeared .
there was a version of rapunzel not sure if that was the title of the story but i 'm assuming so .
a pregnant woman gets her husband to steal greens out of the witch 's garden and the witch makes them give up the baby .
the witch locks her in a tower and eventually a prince rides by and climbs her hair and they fall in love .
the witch finds out and causes the prince to fall into brambles blinding him and eventually rapunzel finds him again and cures him of his blindness with her tears .
there is also a version of rumpelstiltskin where he helps her spin golden thread for three days in exchange for her firstborn child .
then he gives her a chance to keep her child if she can guess his name in 3 days .
she eventually hears him singing his name and gets to keep her baby .
i want to say there is a number in the title like 100 or 50 and a list of all the stories in a table of contents .
but i feel like that 's too many so i could be wrong .

did you know that your emotional right brain trumps your logical left brain when making decisions in life ?
at the age of two the brain 's right side as it develops becomes more active and dominant over the left brain which is home to language logic and reason .
we think that we are reasonable when it comes to making important decisions but apparently it 's all but an illusion .
when our right brain makes an emotional decision our left brain tricks us and comes up with a logical reason to justify our decision .
this process is called post-rationalization. in fact this process has been scientifically proven by a neuropsychologist named roger sperry .
in his experiment he triggered the command to walk in a subject 's right brain emotion in a way that the left logic brain was unaware .
interestingly the subjects actually got up and started to walk .
yet when asked why they decided to walk they came up with random reasons such as wanting to stretch or to get a drink of water .
the amazing part was that these subjects were not lying .
they were entirely honest because they were tricked and believed the reasoning provided by their left logic brains !
understanding the connection between our emotions and decisions is important .
we make decisions every single day and it 's the very act of deciding that leads to our actions and results .
i have shared with our readers before how my decision to relocate from new zealand to singapore have completely changed my life http www.transformingadjustments.com/success/2015/3/24/5-true-meanings-of-happiness-6-figure-salary-and-rolexes-dont-cut-it .
i experienced new things gradually changed my values in life gained and lost priceless things and ultimately became a different person .
one single decision have changed my life upside down .
decisions have the power to alter the course of our lives .
but it 's not just the big decisions but also the small ones .
http www.transformingadjustments.com/health/2015/7/7/7-life-transforming-things-you-can-do-every-day deciding to smile when you are upset deciding to be grateful deciding to wake up early or even deciding to drink more water .
they are all trivial things but just like the ripples in a pond when you throw a tiny pebble every single decision we make big or small will have a consequence in our lives .
if we sum up the information above it can be concluded that
we are innately unreasonable beings because our emotional right brain trumps over our logical left brain .
more often than not we make decisions based off our emotions .
decisions produce actions and our actions is what shapes our future .
this means that we are victims of our own emotions .
although we know and understand that our decisions define our course of life it 's scientifically proven that we make emotional decisions over logic .
this is bad news for anyone that wants to live a life by design and be successful in all facets of life .
surely you would n't want your emotions to dictate how your life turns out .
it is impossible to live a life entirely detached from one 's emotions but it can be done temporarily .
self-observation techniques is one of the best methods to keep your sanity and have your emotions in check .
by observing yourself you can create distance from an event to better assess your emotions and thoughts in a non-judgmental way .
one of the most effective way of practicing self-observation is to keep a diary .
i am an avid fan of writing journals and i do it quite systematically .
http www.transformingadjustments.com/success/2015/4/24/how-to-do-morning-rituals-and-do-it-right every morning i write a list of all the things that i am grateful for .
writing a gratitude list makes me happy for all the things that i have and it attracts more of the things that i am grateful for .
throughout the day i write about the day ahead my feelings towards a certain event or a person a conversation log problems that i 'm facing and events that a noteworthy .
whenever i take a ride on public transportation or at any given down time i do the following steps
stand or sit upright with the spine straight as possible
take moments to simply be and notice whatever i am experiencing in that moment ‚Äì sounds thoughts feelings sensations etc .
6 seconds of deep diaphragmatic breathing through the nose hold for 2 and exhale through the mouth for 6 seconds and repeat .
whenever the mind wanders away from the breath gently refocus on breathing .
this works for me because it 's simple and versatile .
but there 's many other forms of meditation out there and it 's best to choose what works for you .
we all want to be live and have something better .
before you think about how to change the world around you start by changing yourself and becoming a slave to good habits .
not everyone turns out to be successful and it 's not because of knowledge .
there is never a lack of knowledge we all know what to do and what not do .
taking action is all the difference it makes in becoming the person and living the life that you want .
now that you understand our innate flaws of being emotional creatures do at least one of the actions outlined above to have your emotions in check .
be in control over emotions and you will be in control over your life .
if for no other reason to at least try it and gauge if you are deficient .
take it every day before bed for a week .
i started with 2 per day one at lunch another at dinner but cut it down to just one later during the day right after dinner because of the immense lethargy it causes right after .
within an hour i am not able to keep my eyes open and just want to crawl into bed .
i wake up after 6-7 hours of sleep feeling almost euphoric .
it is like something an important chemical reaction had been missing inside of my body and brain all this time and now it is finally there .
my thoughts feel much less negative and instead of wallowing in my self pity and getting frustrated with problems i see myself thinking about solutions instead .
it is almost like a 180 degree change in my mindset .

hey guys i did like to ask a few things and throw out a bunch of ideas while i am at it .
so i picked up dragon 's dogma last week on pc and i am enjoying it very much .
sadly i have come to the point now that i am pretty much to strong lvl 72 to enjoy the open world and to low level to go about bitterblack isle without getting my ass handed to me .
what i actually want is a mod or dlc which will probably never happen that adds monsters of high level max hp for all enemies i refer to the big monsters afcourse more monsters multiple chimera 's in a small area hydra 's liches griffins etc etc aka ddda hunting edition as i did like to call it .
more armors so killing all these high level enemies has a meaning to it and afcourse at lvl 200 you would still have shit to go about
is there anyway to modify the stats of enemies at this moment ?
i did like to do it myself but i have zero expirience modding .
i so far have only seen mods that alter the stats of the players themselfs

in the past it was always a launcher for government payloads that could also put up comsats .

even if it will go away eventually something else will probably come up with your active lifestyle .
going to a physio is worthwhile not just for fixing problems but for preventing them from even starting .
as for the problem itself it 's next to impossible to diagnose anything unless it 's a general stab in the dark really depends on how you 're moving where the pain is exactly what kind of pain it is what movements provoke/alleviate the pain etc .
with all due respect to u/koreaninjabjj i do n't know if there 's much value in seeing your gp first unless you suspect a bigger problem that a physio ca n't treat odds are he might prescribe some pain medication rule out more serious conditions and tell you to take it easy for a few days .
physios are movement specialists they identify not only what the problem might be but how to fix it and how to prevent it from coming back .
if the problem is beyond what they can do they 'll let you know to go see your gp or whichever health professional is capable of dealing with the problem .

look up sunrise florida in broward county specifically black friday towing scandals and you can thank those companies involved for those regulations but here in texas where i live and work we have to accept multiple forms of payment including credit cards which people do chargebacks on all the time luckily though we can refuse personal checks because people would stop payment on them every single time if we did

today i gained about 70-80k rp but i was able to power up just one s card from s2 to s3 .

why are you upset that he is informing people of proper terminology ?
if he is on antipsychotics acid likely wo n't do much .
when i was on abilify i tried a tab of acid .
this tab was from the same strip of acid that caused previous trips before abilify that were quite fun .
he really should n't be doing any drugs at all when on anti-psychotics .
they can be very potent drugs that do not interact well with other drugs .
lsd is also a drug that is very set and setting dependent .
it is probably not a good idea for someone who is still learning how to deal with a mental illness to take it .
i do n't think dlc '' would be the right term .
in fact any purchase in this game could be seen as dlc .
if anything i think weapon sets could be cool .
kinda like you get the asguardian set when you buy collectors .
they could have a weapon pack that gives you a specific skin for each weapon .
like a grunt birthday '' effect or lightning or something .
i mean i love my michael bay-esque explosions but it 'd be cool to have more options .
papa fugly i approve since its more for fun .

it depends on the situation and what type of decision .
applying for grad school or applying for a new job ?
100 pumped about it and wanting to help me any way he can .
how i personally decide to deal with a conflict within my friend group ?
he may have a different idea on what to say but he 'll respectfully disagree .
he 'll be happy if the way i decided to go about it goes well .
he 's always there to help and very invested in my future .
it all depends on upvotes week one there was 1,200 entries 300ish up votes .
week two 367 with 100 ish 75 and 25 i 'm not begging for upvotes i just like seeing 1k people enter and testing the limits of google .
we only averaged 215 entries not including preseason on r/bengals .
i 'd love to see an avg next season of 300 and 50 being bengals fans it was about 30-40 this season no real way to tell .
no relic is going to get you a ton of summons rarely a new relic will get around 50-70k gil in a day for a short time after it 's released with people wanting to try it out but after that things will settle down .
all your best relics are commonly available on the spreadsheet so i do n't think it really matters what you pick .
or the fact that the first graphics card was the same price as the second one etc .

asexuality is not a choice same as with any other sexual orientation .
in the same way if you 're a heterosexual guy you did n't choose to not have an interest in men and you could n't suddenly choose '' to be gay we do n't choose it it just sort of happens .

thanks for the reply by any chance did you remove 2 pictures ? ! ? !
actually according to the bible the bigger '' jew you are the harsher your punishments will be for even the most minor of sins .
for instance god did not allow moses to enter israel after exiling the nation from egypt all because he spoke behind his wife 's back or something like that i can not remember precisely .
on the contrary jacob 's brother who committed many many sins throughout his lifetime was forgiven at his moment of death because he sincerely regretted everything he had done and understood it was wrong .
we expect more from those above us and less from those beneath us .
this happened to me when zeratul was really popular .

i see iowa has decided to join msu and oklahoma in the being good at both revenue sports '' club .
depending on their brand of crazy some lasted longer than other .
i actually had one guy from my church days who was a real fuckin ' loon .
my personal favorite was his rant about a citi bank commercial .
the couple in the commercial decided to spend their extra money on rock climbing instead of a rock engagement ring and he had an all caps message about them continuing to live in sin .
when he started belittling me for my life choice fucker had to go .
after a while i realized it just really irritated me and that it did n't make sense to keep them around .
my social media needs to be for my friends doing awesome shit and i 'm lucky to have quite a few of those .

edit i also think most of those people have told me kids are not in the game plan or at least are n't on it until 40 ... so
still though google is n't doing this because they care about such things but rather because they are being forced to do so .
i 'm not saying that this absolves them of culpability but i would put the blame where it belongs and that 's on our overzealous and unchecked law enforcement .
i completely understand leos wanting these powers but it is terrifying that they are actually getting them .
i 'm a little late to this but my husband deserves the brag .

i had a 12 hour clinical shift so working for free basically on friday that was an hours drive away effectively making it a 14-15 hour long day .
everything hurt and i was grumpy cause i could n't even go home and have a glass of wine .
my husband texted me and told me to let him know when i was 15 minutes from home .
i did and when i walked in the door he had the table set dinner finishing candles lit some fancy cheese and crackers sitting out and a bottle of alcohol free wine waiting for me .
he knew i had a long day and he wanted to make me smile .
you 'd do realize that all those hit pieces '' are legit stories of what he did .
the donald just be an asshole about it does n't make them false .
his defining characteristic is racism against muslims and hispanics .
he made fun of a disabled reporter because of an article he wrote years ago .
the donald just says i never said that '' or the media is evil '' and that makes it go away at least for you morons .
i was in a long-term trip to asia and could n't find proper medicine there .
i ordered online though previously i thought it was not reliable .
i was pleasantly surprised by canadian pharmacy http rx.myprivaterx.com they shipped everything very quickly pills were just as my usual medicine and i paid less .
now i 'm their loyal client for more than a year .
gahhh i really need to sign into reddit more often .
i lurk around a lot on my phone but it never really keeps me logged in while i 'm on the mobile site .
okay this is a really general question butttttt how do you practice ?
i sometimes like to vibe with the music and move how i feel like moving but other times i try to work on my hits when popping .
and this reminds me why crucible drops need to increase .
probably play like 80 crucible vs pve since ttk dropped and still no party crasher 1 .
it may look good right now but so did watch dogs and assassins creed unity before they were released .
ubisoft have a reputation for showing us pre-release trailers for their games running on super pcs then releasing the console versions that look like shit .
the division may end up being a great game but i wo n't be buying it because fuck ubisoft basically .

michael floyd has played well but i do n't like the lack of consistency .

i agree i think koreans in korea are way better than westerners but when they come to na and have communication issues and lack the korean coaching staff i think it evens out a bit .
i still the the koreans are generally a bit better but it is n't miles ahead like if they were playing in korea for a korean team .

to piggyback on your piggybacking fans of good teams using their team 's success to invalidate opinions of fans of worse teams .
rutger 's fan says something negative but valid about alabama .
alabama fan yea well what has rutger 's done ?
fans of bad teams are n't allowed to have opinions now ?
i crashed my bicycle going down a hill about 45mph and had a pretty serious case of road rash bleeding everywhere .
got to the er and they sent me back ahead of everyone else right away .

i got the mig-29 dragon on my third sortie after the patch .
and my streak of getting absolutely nothing related to the ildom sters was unfortunately broken when rngesus gave me a gold box with the anastasia character emblem .
do n't get me wrong i like anime just not to the excessive extent that i see it in infinity .
if it was nose art then i could understand but an entire aircraft is way too far no raptor should ever be neon-highlighter pink with sparkles all over it .
luckily rngesus made up for it and for the next five matches i got free stocked fuel 1x per match so i guess it was worth it .
cheers man i 've been trying to remember for months .
there are worst players/qbs in the hall of fame than him .

sorry am fans just had to vent on that after seeing this thing all over the internet today .
yeah especially when it 's obvious the team is trying way too hard and it has nothing to do with their team .
i have not encountered the prep phase nitro cell party since they implemented their fix .
but i think the instant a defender goes outside it should be alerted instead of a 2 second delay .
so instead of a sniper taking players out it would just be a spotter on top of his game .
i had n't heard of autoapps but i 'll look into it !
that has nothing to do with the fact that they 're misrepresenting their financial status .
you commonly hold your breath hop in and pray you get let out in time .
right now it 's crap and adults are taking all the crap jobs teenagers usually depend on .
i 'll agree that they should probably change the spelling if they want people to be able to intuit how to spell it .
i mean how the hell do you get woos-ter '' from worcester ?
maybe they should just put up signs with the pronunciation .

the thing people forget is that this is a rookie squad .
piglet and fenix are the only ones remaining from last season .

to extend u/sleeps_with_crazy 's answer ito calculus is really interesting when the in function to be integrated stops being deterministic .
with a deterministic l^2 function you do n't need ito .
it is a weiner integral and a classic ibp shows it is a stieljes integral .
but ito calculus in all its glory stochastic process integrated wrt a martingale stops having any connection to stieljes integral since no ibp argument can result in bounded variation functions and you have to resort to ito isometry to show existance .
he knows the more outrageous the stuff he says is the more people talk about him which keeps him in the spotlight and pushes everyone else out of it .

newer windows phones are so broken that they ca n't sustain a continuous connection to the internet .
setting lineups each week is usually my weak point .

you might try to find a mobile car audio/security person in your area .
the fact that there is already a priest shortage may have played into part of the cover up .
koichoco ending s i agree that chisato should n't have won and if anything that her winning seemed forced .
but i disagree they did n't enjoy each other 's company .
she was more into him than vice versa but it was n't so much so i 'd say he did n't enjoy her company .
my issue was that yuuki did n't enjoy her as woman due to him feeling like her brother 's replacement .
he clearly rejected her once and ignored her a few other times romantically .
the way they resolved it felt way too quick .
they should have had that argument a lot earlier than showed him letting his feelings go and eventually being romantically into her .
i do agree with you on the overall score of 7/10 though .
and about mifuyu 's route ... yea that was n't handled well .
s i was so let down when they revealed her loyalty to chisato was due to a scar .
maybe it 's just a japanese thing but it was hard to believe she got seriously shunned in swim class or whatever it was for having that scar .
anime would have been better without trying to force her and michiru 's route in to me . ''
since the people who do like it praise them so much that i want in on it
i 'm not sure what you dislike about it so much but i hope you do give it a second chance .
feels like a minority opinion but i 'll stand by it nonetheless .
hopefully someone puts up a vod when possible i 'd like to watch it again i missed quite a lot because i was laughing too hard .

both of those games have plausible deniability for explicit content .

oops did n't mean to show that lol sorry twitch i thought i was playing all ages version . ''
second life is even worse because it invites a social aspect and near infinite possibilities for whatever out of control of the streamer .
games like dayz people find streams and search them in the game world and kill them .

ooops i kicked the griefer out of my secondlife house because he was spamming porn it was out of my control lol ''

you should have been protected on january 9th because you had more than 7 pills taken properly .
in your case missing the first 2 pills put you at risk from the previous encounter .

we are not talking about international tax agreements that is a whole separate subject plus that is business that is not tax exempt i agree it is bad but that is a different subject .
secondly what does this have to do with people who receive government assistance ! ?
they are people in need who get a helping hand for the government which is paid for with tax money .
does your church give food and help out unconditionally without judgement ?
or are people asked to think about attending your church ?
there are plenty of examples of church 's helping on the condition of attendance .
the government on the other hand unconditionally give support .

the anti-cheese is about a 6.5 the original movie is a 3 .
i 'm so confused how do you print a new updated admission ticket '' ?
that 's the direction college board has on the sat test center closings site .

difference between my ratio of cuss words verbalized to words verbalized averaged over every year of my life and the average ratio of everyone else born within 12 months of me averaged in the same way .
edit i do n't think that was super clear ...
when i turn 1 take the number of times i cussed over the previous year and divide by the number of words i spoke in the previous year .
add them all up and divide by the number of years i lived .
do the same for everyone born within 1 year of me .
add all of those numbers up counting each one however many times the number of years the source person lived .
well at least i can say i spent this time pooping productively ?

if you notice there is very little in the cash shop that costs exactly one of the amounts in the picture .
so no matter what you buy you will have left over currency which increases the likelihood of you purchasing more currency down the road usually during a sale .
oh a sale for 300 and i have 250 in the shop .
i 'll just buy the smallest one it 's only a few dollars . ''
in addition you are much less likely to buy something that says 24 '' than you are to buy something that says 1720 ncsoft coins .

well most phones have a home button or back button .
i have the droid turbo which does have these buttons and i use the home button .
so i do this then manually close app through a task manager sorta thing .
so in return if the phone has no buttons they would have to force shutdown the phone .
in some cases phones may have the button built into screen but when in an app they wo n't be there anymore to maximize screen usage .
sadly a bug made facial surgery unavailable to me after completing one of nick 's detective cases .
i can still use the console but it 's harder to use that way and is missing some functionality .
i did a thing similar to yours at first though .
started with the no nonsense '' haircut changed it to one of the more ruffled ones after getting out of the vault since no one looks that clean getting up from a nap especially for 200 years .
later went for the unladylike '' raider-style one then went back to vault 81 to get the prim and proper hair back .
now that the minutemen have their shit back together and i 'm the leader of a prestigious organization i should look the part .
never really did much with facial reconstruction except to change makeup scarring dirt and stuff .
seems silly that i have to go to a surgeon to do that .
look i 'm not a hillary supporter but this guy was clearly ambushing her .

i do n't care how dallin h oaks defines a bigot .
oaks and the rest of his cronies in the 1st presidency and 12 apostles are all bigots and since god gave thomas s monson a bigoted revelation '' that makes god a bigot too .
although that number is probably lower due to a lot of ppl quitting smoking by vaping

one day i went to my friends house and he was downstairs with his brother as soon as i get there his brother says hey dude did you hear vance got 26 kills in halo he 's been bragging about it a day '' my friend replays dude no i have n't '' later that day he was playing halo master chief collection swat .
after playing for a little bit he gets into a game where he gets 38 kills after that me and his brother ask him if he 's gon na brag about getting 38 he sarcastically says yes .
ever since that day all of our friends and his family have just been around saying 38 and telling people about 38
he still needs to work on his facial expressions.. he looks confused

i remember watching bowling for columbine and liking it when it came out but i remember finding a site like this http www.hardylaw.net/truth_about_bowling.html basically saying the entire thing is inaccurate .
i have n't read that site in over a decade so i 'm not sure of it 's accuracy at all .
however is n't there some huge issue with accuracy every time he makes a film ?
not all r600 driven chips have tesselation enabled atm and some might never have .
aside from that some r600 cards do not implement fp64 in hardware and it will have to be emulated in software .
it 's still being discussed on the development lists i think .
i think there is a variable override to force mesa to advertise 4.1 just do n't remember it atm .
cypress/cayman/aruba earlier r6xx/r7xx chips only support a subset of the needed fp64 ops and do n't do gl4 anyway .
it 's a similar thing as it was in early r300/r400 cards .
amd lied about level of opengl support i remember that there was entire generation of amd cards where the driver lied about hardware support for npot textures which was a prerequisite to certain features related to desktop compositing at the time .

that 's ok. maybe experiment and do shampooing only once out of those 3x per week ?

think my depression started in high school but was n't sure what it was .
i just remember occasionally thinking of suicide and crying every day .
i felt alone despite having friends and from that it progressed .
by the time college came around i had the image of a clean slate and lots of friends maybe a relationship even .
i did everything i could to make it happen even joining a popular sorority .
i ended up getting a bid from the least popular too but i did n't accept it .
first few weeks were great but i started to notice the same pattern .
i 'm not usually ignored but i 'm also never sought out .
i 'm confident if i disappeared for a few weeks no one would notice .
i started to post these quotes on pinterest because seeing them from someone else made me feel better .
but then someone saw them and told the president and then a girl my roommate actually went behind my back and told people i was depressed .
then one day i casually asked if my shirt was too wrinkly to wear of all things .
the girl said it was then i just shrugged and after a second said i do n't think it 's too wrinkly . ''
she ranted at me saying i was too argumentative and no one liked me and so much else .
our roommates walked in and i did n't want to involve them so i wrote her a note figuring i could keep it together better that way anyways .
i admit i lashed out at her in it saying that it was n't fair for her to say that and how she also got on my nerves but how i could n't understand how she could say that everyone hated me when she thought i was already depressed .
she called me immature for writing a note and denied everything .
it felt like a slap in the face and i spend the next two weeks away from the house pathetically crying in a coffee shop .
other things happened i messaged a mutual friend if she could basically tell me everything that was wrong with me so i could fix me .
i wanted to know if there was anything i could fix to make people like me more and i cried to my other roommates about how i was afraid of leaving because i did n't want people talking behind my back but also afraid to be here and see her i had n't told anyone who it was because we agreed to keep it between ourselves but apparently she had told them because they asked if it was about her .
i 'm not sure what she told them and i knew she talked about me but i figured it would be better for my health if i just left it alone .
fast forward a depressing few weeks where i could n't sleep or eat and i got so drunk one night that my sisters took me to the hospital because they were afraid of me hurting myself .
the whole house heard about it some heard me yelling too .
luckily i did n't get committed or anything because i was drunk and told the doctor it was just the alcohol and by all rights i do n't look like i would be depressed .
i had to attend three counseling sessions and i got a citation for disturbing the peace though because police were called .
i 've convinced my family that i 'm not depressed but it makes me sick every time they bring it up .
i also chipped a tooth that night so every time i look in the mirror or my talks about seeing a dentist it 's like a horrible horrible flashback .
my family is great but i never want them to know i have depression .
after that i was so anxious and sick that i did n't eat for a week but eventually made myself start eating toast because i knew it was n't healthy .
i was treated like an outcast in my own house and i do n't have many friends .
like i said i 'm basically jut tolerated now and i 'm stuck here for another 2 years .
i do n't know how to live past that legacy and i equally want to address it with the house and pretend it never happened .
somedays are good now i get through the day without any crushing sadness and others are not so great and i ca n't do anything just isolate myself and pretend i do n't exist .
i just want to know what to do if i should wait it out or what .
i have read and heard a few things lately and more significantly have had some experiences that make me wonder whether the whole ymmv attitude toward all things wet shaving may actually be more complicated .
maybe our different impressions of different products are n't simply a matter of personal preference .
what got me thinking about this was u/cadinsor 's experience with the parker 24c .
he posted a video to his youtube channel where he shaved with the razor and found it a bit uncomfortable .
plenty of people suggested that maybe his angle was too steep so he made an adjustment tried again and posted another video in which the razor gave him much better results .
that may actually be consistent with the mileage analogy .
if i am fond of jackrabbit starts i 'm gon na burn a lot more fuel than someone who drives more conservatively .
poor technique and a manual transmission can lead to membership in the clutch-of-the-month club just like too much pressure will tend to cause razor burn .
but i wonder if maybe there are differences between the products we 're using too .
i 've recently re-purchased new examples of a couple of razors that were my favorites in years past including the merkur 34c and the standard .
the 34c is much more comfortable than i recall while the standard is slightly less so .
maybe it 's just faulty recollection but what if it 's more than that ?
what if the tolerances of the razors are wide enough that a razor made today is noticeably different than one made last week or last year or 15 years ago ?
i seem to recall reading that differences in head geometry of as little as 0.05mm make a perceptible difference in the quality of a shave .
we know for a fact that not every razor that comes off an assembly line is absolutely identical if they were there 'd be no need for quality control .
but what about the razors that pass qc because they 're within allowable limits ‚Äì how much variation is there among those razors ?
badgers vary from individual to individual so the notion that the neck hair from one badger will be identical to that from the next is a little absurd .
a good manufacturer can sort them pretty well but there 's bound to be some variation .
and maybe this should have gone in the general questions thread .
but the notion has been percolating all day so i figured i 'd bore the rest of you with it ...

just received court summons my 2nd and 5 th grader received 7 unexcused absences each because of a family trip to florida .
the trip was half vacation and half to see an uncle who was on his death bed .
i worked things out with the kids teachers beforehand and they did homework during the whole trip both kids are getting a 's and b 's .
and minus this trip the children have only missed one other day separate occasions when one was sick .
the summons mentions having kids taken away and so on is this that major of a situation ?

hey im 20 years old and male and i have had this condition for about 7 years and ive seen about a dozen different doctors and had multiple tests but none seem to have diagnosed anything so i thought i would just try asking here .
my symptoms are a mix of symptoms most commonly associated with ms cfs and fibromyalgia but i have n't had a proper diagnosis of any of them so i will just list them all here and see what replies i get .
i have pain all over my body arms legs back neck hands feet and fingers it is usually aching or stabbing pains but sometimes burning sensations .
i get tired extremely easily like by running up a few stairs or ever just doing a small amount of tidying up .
i am extremely sensitive to heat and get hot and sweaty even when others around me are cold .
it is hard for me to fall asleep and also very hard to get me out of bed .
i get migraines usually every other day ranging more moderate to severe and occasionally very severe .
i got angry/annoyed easily and i have a short temper .
i have bad short term memory but a very good long term memory .
i have anxiety and i worry about things too much .
i have quite a low libido sex or watching porn just does n't interest me a lot of the time even though im 20 .
i have difficulty concentrating and learning new skills but i am generally a very intelligent person .
i used to get twitches in my arms and legs but that has lessened now .
i sometimes get severe pains in my chest that throw me to the ground because they are so painful .
i often have difficulty breathing and catching my breath sometimes for no reason .
basically i cant walk very far from my home because it is just too tiring and painful for my legs and i can not work .
i also had an episode of urinary retention about 2 years ago and i had a catheter for a week but that hasnt happened since but it is often hard for me to start a flow of urine when i need to urinate .
hey guys sorry if this has been covered before .

just to quickly point out the obvious that i do n't own of the characters and that this is nothing but a fan-fiction .
i dunno if i can really count this as a chapter since the extract is so short but it 's all i 've got so far and i 'd like to hear some feedback to see which direction to head in !
i have n't written in a while so chances are this is n't your usual fan-fiction quality !
but i figured i 'd give it a try anyway !
nagisa ... my voice was naught but a murmur trying to reach out into the void .
tears rolled down my cheek as i clung on to her small fragile hand pleading for some kind of miracle .
i could n't bear to turn around to look at the faces of the family that had done so much for me the family i had destroyed .
ushio 's wails continued to drown the room 's otherwise empty silence as i was engulfed by pain and suffering .
this was pain like no other a pain that threatened to rip apart my whole existence .
my faltering voice and tight grasp gave out simultaneously extinguishing any strength i still carried .
a sudden feeling or warmth surged through my body as a gentle hand touched my back .
this touch belonged to sanae a touch almost identical to that of nagisa 's .
i 'm so sorry ... these words though spoken gently cut through me like a sharp blade .
what was i to say to the mother whose daughter i had robbed of life ... ?
we 'll get through this tomoya we 'll get through this i promise .
through red puffy eyes it was just possible to distinguish sanae 's face .
whilst it no longer upheld the happy and sarcastic expression it usually carried it was n't brimming with suffering either .
my head sunk into sanae 's shoulder as i bawled uncontrollably .
i felt so weak crying this way when sanae was yet to shed a single tear .
tomoya ... let me take you elsewhere you ca n't stay here .
it was the first he had spoken in hours and like sanae he had no trouble keeping his emotions under control .
i ... i ca n't just leave her ... the words tumbled out of my mouth before i even knew what i was saying .
as much as it hurt to stay in her presence there was no part of me that wanted to be without it either .
listen kid i know it hurts i wish they could have been an alternative .
but you got ta be strong for us for ushio and nagisa ! just hearing the name made my heart tear apart .
to the father who continued to do nothing but ruin my life ?
to the bakery whose walls held all those memories ?

i was wondering if there is any way to transfer the saves off the game cartridges and import in the games on emunand ?

are there any other tools out there for this or are my saves stuck on the game cartridges ?

by now i 've seen loads of videos/posts/threads about pvms or similar monitors that people have but they could n't have all come from ebay .
i understand that you can get lucky by just stumbling across one at a flea market or something but that is highly unlikely and not something that everyone can count on .
so then what is the best way to track down a nice monitor locally ?
what types of businesses may have them lying around somewhere and most importantly how can you contact them or convince them to sell one to you ?
surely there is a way to find these in the wild as they come up on ebay constantly .

what he did n't know was that there really was such a thing as life after death and that the multiverse was a far larger place than he thought .
a lucky twist of fate one of the few in ning 's life meant that ning was reborn into a world of immortals and monsters of ki refiners and powerful fiendgods a world where dynasties lasted for millions of years .
a world which is both greater ... and yet also smaller ... than he ever could imagine .
he would have the opportunity to join them and in this life ning swore to himself he would never let himself be weak again !
the era he was born into was a desolate one but ning would make it his era .

i 've seen in many shabads the reference to mother comes .
why we need to tell her about this fact ?
i have a theory but not sure if it is the right one
mother usually keeps you attached with family and worldly matters just like kabeer ji 's mother cried when kabeer ji went into bhagti why she cried is the basis of former argument .
a mother would want her son/daughter to excel in worldly matters too and not leave everything become a saint but this sometimes may lead to resistance to even walking to path of being a saint .
such trait is found in our mind '' as well so maybe maey is used metaphorically to remind our mind that forget of worldly matters how can you forget god when he/she/it is the only truth .
is it simply a reminder to our mother that how can you forget god ?

my high school requires all seniors to complete a project of personal interest and i decided to learn shorthand for my project .
for the project i am required to have a mentor who is qualified in my project 's field .
a mentor would primarily have to sign off that i am learning shorthand to a satisfactory degree so being my mentor will only require a couple short meetings over the next few months .
i can be very flexible about where and when we meet .
i will be learning shorthand on my own from a workbook so you as a mentor wo n't have to spend a lot of time giving me lessons or anything .
i am willing to learn any common version of shorthand depending on what version you know .
if you live in the sf bay area and know shorthand or know someone who knows shorthand please let me know .
edit as of right now i am still looking for a mentor .
how would have roman reigns vs hhh done as a main event financially if wwe network didnt exist and wwe still followed the ppv model for wrestlemania ?
i 've been thinking about this scenario ever since i read a post on gonewildstories that has since been deleted .
for this prompt i 'm looking for someone to rp as a mostly innocent college-aged girl that 's been brought to a shady bar either by her friends and boyfriend who knows the dj and is in on it or by her family and boyfriend same deal if you 're into playing it with a slight incest angle .
i 'm happy to forgo that part if it does n't appeal to you however .
you 're brought to the bar where unbeknownst to you there is a wet-tshirt contest going on .
you 're picked out of the crowd by the dj and coerced into participating in the show dubcon against your best wishes .
except you do n't end up on stage with the rest of the girls you 'll become the star of the show..
i would rp as the dj and also a narrator of sorts describing what you hear and see and are asked to do .
i would be looking for you to mostly describe how the situation makes you feel with an omniscient narration .
this prompt would be mostly psychological and less physical .
i 'm looking for a few short paragraphs per response and am open to something longer term because that seems to always fit both partners ' schedules better .
my kink list is here although a lot of it probably does n't apply due to my character not really being a hands on participant .
mainly i 'm looking to explore the dom side of public humiliation and possibly an incestuous slant but again not required https i.imgur.com/lcljeqa.png
for my game i wanted to try something a bit different than a normal dungeon crawl i want to have an escalating series of situations that seem like they will inevitably lead to a spooky '' style combat but then ... nothing .
i want to mess with the players ' minds and expectations a bit and i 'm thinking that the more build up there is without the stress relieving oh it 's time to roll initiative '' the more tense it will become .
or maybe i lack the dm skills and it will just become a farce .
time will tell but i 'm looking for some suggestions .
the players are exploring the long abandoned undercity of what was once the greatest city in the known world .
they are very deep underground at this point and have already met some rather disturbing creatures .
old cryptic graffiti written in modern common throughout the ruins while simultaneously stressing how it is clear that no one had been here for an extremely long time .
all will be arc words of some kind related to the already creepy mysteries of what had happened to the old city but eventually i 'm thinking of including a few meta ones that seemingly describe their actions .
they will pass through an area that used to be a holding area for the old city 's slaves and in a hallway they will find several metal statues showing various people in creatively done agony .
each has an inscription describing a virtue of the slave . ''
to subvert the expectation of creepy statues come to life '' they will instead will not ... but closer inspection will reveal that these statues are actually shaped around human remains .
perhaps a cruel punishment for subverting each inscribed virtue a reminder to keep the others in line .
another will see a hooded humanoid form walk by a doorway while the rest are distracted but find nothing .
so what non-encounters/details would you use for something like this ?

anyone know of anyone sour apple and menthol flavored juices ?

let me start off with say i have crohn 's disease .
but let me also say this is in no way just a post to talk about my disease on because if it was i wouldnt be posting on this subreddit .
this is a post about how i have been loved through my disease and how i wish every woman is able to find a love so kind because this is what we all deserve .
i have been battling with crohn 's disease for about 8 years now .
crohn 's disease is an autoimmune disorder in which my body attacks itself specifically my colon.in the past it has caused me to lose pints of blood .
for about 2 years now i have been on a medication called remicade that has stopped all my bleeding .
6 months ago until this very day i have developed severe joint and muscle pain .
the severe pain is in my fingers my toes my knees my calfs my buttocks and both of my upper shoulders .
it has been determined that remicade is not the cause of my pain although i have been taken off of it for precautionary measures .
i have been to 7 doctors and my pain has yet to be diagnosed .
i was working at a fast food restaurant and a boy asked my friend to ask me if it was ok if he gave him my number .
i ofcourse accepted i had always kind of though he was cute .
we fell in love immediately at least i did i think he secretly did too .
i told him i loved him about 2 weeks in and he was scared because he had just gotten out of a 6 year relationship in which the other party had been unfaithful .
but it was ok we were both so sweet to each other then that i knew if we continued on we would soon be crazy about each other .
about two weeks later he told me he loved me too .
every day with him is perfect we have very little fights and we try to forget them i have a hard time with that but he helps teach me .
i cry and cry and he scoops me up like a baby and rocks me until i feel a little less overwhelmed .
she gives me muscle relaxers and says all my mri 's come in ok. she sends me home .
my parents are skeptical if the pain i have is really as severe as i say it is .
i 've been staying over his house a lot already by this time .
i am a legal adult but my parents had been supporting my school up to that point and are strict about boys .
i had to quit work and school later on down the road .
my series of events is a bit mixed up so please excuse it.so like i said by this time i can come over a lot more.all he does when i am in pain is massage my toes kiss my feet squish my fingers massage my butt my shoulders my calfs .
my boyfriend is happy he thinks ill be ok now .
my third visit to the chiropractor leaves me numb and crying .
it turns out i do not have scoliosis.i have to be on bed rest for two weeks .
he calls me and messages me when he was n't calling .
he tried to sleepover my house but the way the bed dipped when he was next to me gave me pain .
i was becoming difficult to handle and still am .
i cry every other day in pain and he rocks me .
and his eyes look teary when he does n't know what to do .
i started putting on smelly things things stronger than icy hot .
his nose itches and sniffles when he smells them .
but he rubs them all over me bare handed and lets me lie on his bed with the stinky smelly stuff .
i go to an orthopedic doctor and back to my crohn 's doctor .
they send me home with percocet which i had a strange reaction to i would wake up in the middle of the night with anxiety attacks and he would sing to me until i relaxed .
i started to get mad because sitting hurts and i like to watch tv with him he tries to create pillow forts to support my back like some type of pillow architect .
i always cry and say that why would he love me like this that i am no good .
i mention what if i am some type of rheumatoid arthritis .
he grabs my face and looks into my eyes and says that he will love me forever no matter what .
that he is so happy that he has found someone that loves him like i love him and that we will have a beautiful future together that we will have little fat babies running around .
he makes me food and brings me iced drinks in bed .
he understands when i am too sleepy to play his favorite video game with him .
on one of the severe days he washed me .
i am still in severe pain i am scheduled for so many appointments and might have to travel far far to get a dianosis .
somedays i say i rather die but he says that if i die his soul will die .
somedays i do crazy things because i am in so much pain but he still loves me .
i keep thinking maybe his love for me will decrease with my sickness but it only gets stronger .
it hurts to sit up and it hurts for my fingers to type this but i am not crying because of that .
i am crying because i have found a once in a lifetime love .
i think someone placed him right here at the right time as my guardian angel .
and if he ends up reading this bubs you know i always like to apologize for my circumstance and what a brat i can be with this pain .
but i know you would like me to say this that i never have to explain anything to you because you already knew what i was going to say before i said it and you would n't care if i never apologized because you have forgiven me before i have even wronged you .
because you tell me your love for me is unconditional .
you are my life my love my world my rock .
reddit users do n't settle find a love as kind and as good as the one this man has planted in me and i in him
i got some pawn name hamond or something to that effect .
he was a warrior and was a fucking beast .
we were fighting an ogre everyone is down but me and him i am at 20 hp can barely hear shit when all of a sudden i see him climbing thinking to myself the fuck is he doing '' as the ogre starts rushing me then out of nowhere as if he was timing it he fucking jumps into the air smashing his sword down into the ogre killing it as soon as its about to swing at me and end me rightly .
sad that i would eventually have to change him out simply amazed by what he had just done .
makes me happy to see him progress but of late he is the same level .

what is the point of having premade teams against random teams and giving a member on the premade team his own rank ?

i just realized how stupid it is to allow this .

i use whatsapp a lot and me and my friends have tons of funny images and audio clips that we reuse all the time for example the darth vader 'nooooooooo ' audio clip or a photo of my friend 's middle finger
to find a specific media in a phone is like looking for a needle in a haystack .
it takes a lot of effort to do it but for the comedic effect i still do it .
i tried to search for apps that can organize my media files in whatsapp and let me reuse them easily but i could n't find one .
please try it out and let me know what you think .
i made a quick video on how to use it https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=uznatz5pfmy
and here is the link to the app in google play https play.google.com/store/apps/details ? id=net.thesimplest.customchatstickersinstantly
extra if you are into soundboards please continue to read
i think i accidentally written an app that can be customized into any soundboard if you are into that kind of thing .
just throw all the mp3s properly named into the customchatstickers folder and you have your own soundboard just like the one shown in the screenshot and it is better easier to preview and share than the prefab arnold soundboard apps on google play .
i absolutely do n't want to work as a dungeon master until i indulge in my laziness

... you just saved me my controller i was going to throw it on the floor if i died to this boss one more time thank you whoever you are .
i solo 'd every other boss except this one f this boss and its 2nd phase .
so to start off my group we only just started playing dnd just recently only about 5 months ago .
so the campaign we are in is a home brew and the party consists of a neutral good gnome wizard a neutral good half elf druid chaotic neutral dragon born fighter chaotic neutral drow rogue and lastly myself as the chaotic neutral wood elf monk .
i will start off with a little bit of my backstory to clear things up later .
my character was raised at a very young age to be one with the shadows and was trained in the arts of assassination and torture .
my party members know nothing of my past and i am not too eager to tell them unless i absolutely have to tell them to save my life .
and due to my special talents when i interrogate or question villainous characters i tend to get a little creative with my methods so i always find a place without prying eyes of my comrades to do my business .
and my character is all about sarcasm and jokes to cope .
so the session started off fairly normal we just finished a trial of bravery in the fight pits to determine if we were strong enough to be of use to help rescue the commander 's daughter from some particularly dangerous bandits .
this was an urgent mission due to the fact that a damsel 's life was in danger so i went down to the dungeons of the castle where a bandit was taken prisoner .
i started interrogating and basically torturing the bandit with very vivid detail until he told us the location and number of his troupe .
after i received the info on the location i informed our part to rendezvous at the inn first thing in the morning for departure however our druid left on his own with a lack of social skills to go build a tree house in the woods .
we were all okay with it because he does n't know any much about a sense of urgency and we could take on a bandit camp with just four of us .
so it was the rogue wizard fighter and i walking towards the mountains to negotiate with the bandits .
the fighter purchased a beautiful white donkey for an outrageous price of 40gp to take along with us incase the woman was injured .
along the way we found a man running full sprint down the trail with smoke billowing out from the top of the hill he showed no signs of stopping as he was barreling towards me so as a natural reaction .
i took out one of his legs with my quarterstaff to slow him i ended up giving him a rather nasty charlie horse but nothing broken .
he explained that centaurs were attacking his camp and they killed his wife and child as well .
we asked him if he could show us where so we plopped him on the donkey and we ran towards the smoke .
once we arrived we planted the donkey out of view from the camp leaving the wizard to guard it just in case .
we noticed there was attacking group of 4 centaurs huddled around a group of guards that were sent before us to scout out the bandit camp .
as a joke my character said well if all goes to shit we at least have a sacrifice . ''
our wizard was less than enthused but by this time should be accustomed to my sense of humor .
i attempt to negotiate with the centaurs naturally speaking elvish to ask them what we could do to stop them from killing our brothers in arms .
they were having none of my antics and started beheading them .
we engaged the creatures in the attempt to save the men .
during the fight the wizard who was about 80 feet or so away from the camp out of sight from the centaurs decided that he would tell the man on the donkey to take it and to get away from here to where it is safe .
after the battle we untied the guards and the fighter was looking around and wondered where his donkey went .
the wizard told him that he sent it off with the man so they could escape without harm .
this was all fine and dandy with the fighter however he just asked that since the donkey was paid for with his money if he could have compensation for the loss of his property by the hands of the wizard .
it was a calm question nothing personal until the wizard went full meta .
stating how he refused to pay for it because he did a selfless deed saving the poor man that we were going to sacrifice to the centaurs .
he decided to list off everything that my character has done as far as my deeds during interrogations and fights which all of them he was not present for .
so he was going off on how all three of the chaotic neutral characters were evil beings not meant for this campaign taking it out of character at this point .
and i was telling him that 40gp compensation is all he was asking for because he gave away another man 's property .
but he started to tell us everything our players have done that he has n't witnessed to justify the prejudice for the way we play .
and i told him to leave the party if he did n't feel like repaying the fighter back so he ran off back towards the city and abandoned the quest we were given by the nobles of the country over a donkey .
my question is was i wrong to tell him to leave the party if he was trying to force his play style onto our characters ooc or was he right for not compensating a chaotic neutral character because he was neutral good
is there any idea of a wipe before the full game is released ?

i have had this forever and i 'm sick of having it .
it 's a mw karambit slaughter with nearly a full diamond ps white diamond bs .
looks pretty clean but the corner is a bit messed up .
it 's an excellent game with good gameplay and survival elements which are constantly being changed and upgraded .
but one of the elements of the game that intrigued me straight off was the story of the main character and timmy .
i 've often wondered what must be going through the character 's head how he would react to the grisly and grotesque situations laid out before him .
i realize that the developer 's have certain criteria and probably know how the majority of if not the entire story is going to play out .
myself i do n't think i have the patience to wait for the full release .
to that end i 've begin writing a fan fiction about the forest and i was curious if this sub would have any interest in reading my content .
if there 's interest or maybe even if there 's not i will post the first part here within a day or two .
please comment if you would be interested in reading something like this or if i 've made an error in my posting as i have been a lurker for a long while but i have not posted very much .
edit alright i think i will post what i have sometime in the next day or two .
thanks for all your enthusiasm and i 'll try not to disappoint .
please keep in mind that i may change some story elements that i do n't like or ca n't make work the way i want them to but i hope you enjoy the read .
you see on almost any product a list of the ingredients whether it be a brand leading shampoo carbonated soda and almost everything we consume or use body wise .
does this not make it much easier for another brand to replicate the product or at least get pretty close ?

its for a school case i d love if any of you guys can hook me up with info .
at some point in the future de will shut down the warframe servers .
let 's hope it 's 15 years away from now .
when the server will go down we will no longer be able to play warframe .
now i know that some multiplayer games have private servers/server emulators available .
for example world of warcraft mass effect 3 multiplayer etc .
my question is does anyone know what the network setup for warframe looks like ?
if so do you think it would be relatively easy to develop a server emulator .
i have n't tried using fiddler/wireshark with warframe yet .
i only know that matches are run on a player 's machine the matchmaking is done by a server and that alerts/invasions are initiated by a server .
i remember playing my first playthrough as a dwarven noble rogue and i loved it .
i was wandering about a couple of things i would like to replay the dn origin and i was wandering if the dn could become king of orzamarr eventually .
if not i wanted to know if there is a mod that permits it .
also as i have already modded my dao quite a bit i was wandering if the dragon age class and specialization pack was worth checking out .
does it add depth and a refreshing feel to the game or does it make the game unbalanced ?
if not then i was wandering if there were other mods to pick up together with it .
and just generally what other advice would you give me ?
the jungle is a place filled with all kinds of dangerous furry critters with beautiful camouflage pelts .
tekatans already possessed wood ashes from their hearths which they mixed with water and washed the pelts with to soften them and make them nicer to wear .
they also found that by dunking the pelts in a sudsy mixture of filtered wood ash and fish oil the skins became incredibly soft .
the tekatans knew that burning seashells and chalk in the kilns created a white powder that burned wet hands upon touching and could blind people however it took 200 years to utilize this .
the tekatans mixed the powder with water and more ashes until the boiling subsided and it cooled .
one man found that when he left the bucket for a week the mixture had set rock hard and was impossible to remove with water .
so he set about using this wonder material to clog the holes in his walls and prevented the jungle from coming in .
as a bonus fungus that coated other people 's houses in the jungle did n't settle on his .
the mix caught on was perfected and is now used all over tekatan homes for waterproofing and structural support .
they find that this material can clog holes on boats better than stuffed leaves and planks of wood ever could .
resin combined with lime plaster creates a strong inflexible bond that is perfect for attaching two unrelated objects together .
the waiting period is quite long but tekatans do n't mind .
it allows them to mount jewels to copper bracelets and secure joints in wooden construction .
tepoztopilli**-esque weapons the characteristic obsidian blades of the tekatans are mounted in a hardy wooden shell .
the blades can be stouter and used for hacking through dense jungle without the fear of splitting thanks to the newly discovered glue .
by putting the copper jewellery in kilns one found that the metal would become more ductile and far easier to work with .

look at a panda pandas could hardly qualify for fittest '' yet they are surviving well because they are favored by humans .

okay can you at least concede that people have different definitions ?
i do n't know where you get that the dictionary definition of something is obscure '' .
as i find myself saying again and again to you there is often more than one definition for words .
it 's certainly reasonable and happens often that some definitions are more widely used than others .
1. a large container for liquids with a narrow mouth and typically a stopper or cap .
3. stew or boil a hare or rabbit in a covered container .
i 'm not sure where you live but do you use/hear all these definitions equally ?
i know the canadian dollar is pretty weak right now too but maybe general releases and non collaborations would make there way to canada .

arjuna is pretty basic just an aoe atk but it has a small chance for instakill which is if i remember correctly the only aoe instakill np we have .
which is pretty epic if you get that instakill to actually work lol but against unreliable so its really just an aoe atk with a def debuff which isnt really anything new in that regards .
gil 's enuma elish is really just disappointing compared with tesla 's or arjuna 's .
i respect your opinion but i do n't think it 's really relevant here .

well obviously the agent has to be interested in the genre/target audience of the manuscript .
hopefully they 'll list those interests on their website .
beyond that there were certain genres that the agent i worked for considered oversaturated ya paranormal romance for example .
but i 'm not knowledgeable enough about the current epic fantasy market to say whether that 's the case .
it 's hard to judge your case just based on a comment but if the idea is original and well-written and the agents you 're querying rep the genre you should be on the right track .
