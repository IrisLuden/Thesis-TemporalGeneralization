the annoying thing about r is you can only swipe once per meal so sometimes i would be busy and accidentally throw away a swipe
thanks i have a sneaky love of posts like this because there 's so many women who just ca n't recognise anti-male sexism even when its occurring right in front of them .
it 's not that they 're bad people it 's just that they do n't have the ability to register the concept .
seems like everyone on here is telling you you are crazy .
being a 150lb man is n't going to impress anyone .

others have better insight on how to best manage this bullshit email .
i 'm inclined toward nuclear anger in situations like this so any advice i have would n't serve much purpose other than escalating the problem .

well ... if you can manage to get past your autistic spasms and actually complete the act of betrayal and get him to want to do something with you .
maybe if you lose another 14 pounds in 2 weeks and justify it because it was after a binge .

people speak like assholes on here because they 're not going to get their ass beat .

thanks for the lengthy explanation really helps a lot .
before reading this i did some research and found that even the best external drive is not as fast as apple 's mac mini ssds just like you said .
had they been half the price then it would have been a no-brainer .
but even though they are super fast they still suck a bit compared to the mini ssds .
the apple is a bit too tart for me right now but i think i 'll wait a bit and save up for the i7 and 1tb ssd or at least the 500gb .
i actually do want to keep it as long as possible and with the upgrades it 's quite a powerful little machine that should last for a very long time .
.. or i will of course get the next imac in the meantime if apple would be so merciful to launch one with a humane pricetag and contemporary specs .
the best part about this is someone wrote it backwards right to left
what i 'm getting at is that being white and blonde haired is unusual enough that around a third of disney princesses being blonde and white is notable .
there 's so much going on the next few months .
goals for the year find a job and go swim in the bay .
there are millions and millions of houses with lead pipes .
focusing on just flint minimizes the problem with the infrastructure .
so spoiler alert 'cleanses ' as portrayed in popular culture and media they 're not really a thing .
if you want to ask a question like 'how long will it take to get into ketosis ? '
or 'how long does it take to get into autophagy ? '
or 'how long until i lose x amount of weight ? '
those are much more useful questions with actual answers .
most meme formats can be compared to other ones .
for example improvise adapt overcome is the same modern problems require modern solutions '' but people people seem to prefer the modern problems format more .

when i download my save again and it says that this will overwrite the current save is that only for my information on their account ?

police in cohasset last week used tasers to subdue a man who was allegedly attacking a woman in his home with a knife .
the 25-year-old man identified by authorities as erich stelzer became unresponsive at the scene and later died while the woman ‚Äî maegan tapley 24 ‚Äî was hospitalized with extensive injuries .
the incident began on thursday night when cohasset police responded to a 911 call just before 10 p.m. for a report of a disturbance at stelzer 's residence on church street .
when officers entered the home they saw stelzer assaulting a woman with a knife and other weapons according to the da 's office .
in an effort to rescue the victim and disarm stelzer cohasset police officers used tasers to subdue stelzer peggie krippendorf a spokeswoman for the norfolk district attorney 's office said in a statement friday afternoon .
the female victim was able to escape from stelzer and was taken to a local area hospital for treatment.
cohasset police chief william quigley praised the actions of his officers following the incident in a statement released to boston 25 news .
the father of the 25-year-old cohasset man harold stelzer told nbc10 boston following his son 's death that he was looking for justice .
i have a very high-priced lawyer ‚Äî very high-priced .
people will know him and he 's going to put this together he said .
i 'm not looking for money i 'm looking for justice.
harold stelzer told the station that a stun gun was used four times on his son which he described as excessive.
i know that one hit is substantial he said .
stelzer was about 6-foot-8 and 300 pounds his father told the station .
the 25-year-old was a bodybuilder according to masslive documenting his fitness routines on instagram and youtube .
harold stelzer said friday he was in total shock .
i do not even know what is going on he told 7news boston .
i do not know where this behavior came from .
i am sorry for what happened to the girl .
i mean what can i say but until i get the report i can not make judgment .
on saturday stelzer 's family released a statement through an attorney expressing sympathy for tapley and her family and revealing they 'd sought help for the 25-year-old in the days before his alleged attack on his tinder date .
the family of erich stelzer wishes to express its deepest sympathy for the victim and her family philip cormier a lawyer said in the statement according to masslive .
they are without words to adequately communicate their grief and sorrow at the events that transpired the physical and mental pain caused to the victim and the loss of life of a young man who was someone 's little brother and someone 's son.
stelzer had been receiving care from mental health professionals over the past month his family said but during a gathering on christmas they had noticed more of a decline .
he was experiencing delusions and extreme paranoia and behaving erratically the family 's lawyer said .
i t became clear that his needs were not being met the statement read .
believing stelzer was having a psychotic break his family called cohasset police and emts to perform an assessment on dec. 25 .
the assessment by the emts was that he did not need assistance due to the fact that he was lucid enough to know his own name and the date cormier said in the cormier said in the statement reported by masslive .
the family hired a professional intervention team the next day to get stelzer into an inpatient treatment facility but the events of thursday night took place before the intervention could be implemented. ...
what can anyone say except ... with how many bullets would have the attacker 's body been riddled if he had been black or brown ? ''
they prolly knew him and that his family has money

in general there are 3 types of damage gems although there are several variations and mixes among the 3 .
these improve the scaling of your weapon for a particular stat .
so a str scaling gem will make a weapon with b scaling in str have a scaling for example .
these gems are more effective the higher level your stats are .
higher strength or whichever stat scaling gem you get will make that gem more effective .
these gems increase your damage by a flat amount .
very simple gems and there are different types for different types of damage such as physical arcane or fire damage .
these increase the damage you do due to scaling by a flat .
note that it 's only damage from scaling that increases not base damage .
when equipping gems this is the x amount you see next to the base damage .
there are also a variety of these gems such as physical increase or arcane increase .
the top level gems are all found in depth 5 cursed dungeons and all are cursed gems meaning that along with their normal effect they have one negative effect such as increased stamina cost for using the weapon .
outside of chalice dungeons you can find pretty good gems but they are mostly in dlc areas .

after hours and hours of observing the floor 's walls i 've come to a conclusion either the tower 's architects are meticulous enough not to leave any exploitable gaps in their constructs or foolish enough not to provide any emergency exits of sorts .
i run my hand through the walls that are adorned with mere recreations of the town surrounding the christmas tree planted in the exact middle of the scenery towering over all other buildings around it .
i feel no cracks chinks crevices whatever one may call it as my glove-covered hand slowly slides through the walls scraping the snow stuck on it i become more and more anxious .
yes the other carolers obviously will report to anna and others but what if they really have no other way to get in ?
i mean it 's al 's ancestor 's construct right ?
i laugh internally finding the irony of having the tower that helps me from the day i stepped into this world being my grave amusing .
with every passing second the urge to just scream and futilely beg for help increased .
at times like these i 'm grateful that she 's by my side .
lucina stands under the falling snow an arm 's length away right next to me .
the determination and warmth in her voice keeps me going .
her hands encased in gloves that came as part of the christmas costume eirika had given her earlier that day holds a cup of hot chocolate that she had probably prepared at one of the surrounding cottages .
thanks '' i said accepting her token of kindness and gulping it down .
the drink 's flavor is a delicate balance between bitter and sweet a much-needed refreshment .
this building might be too well-designed for us to break through . ''
i sigh and she follows suit amusingly at the same time .
one look at her wo n't give away how much of a wreck she was when the tower 's portal the only gateway connecting us to the castle collapsed trapping us here .
i ca n't forget her anguished face as she dug through the rubble vainly trying to get the portal online again and her defeated look as she blamed herself for delaying both of our returns ...
i 'm sure she still blames herself until now but at least she has considerably mellowed out after the long break i told her to take .
she seems bummered but i do n't want to burden her with menial tasks .
empty-handed we decide to rest inside the cottage we had picked .
for a mere replica the interior is terribly well-designed it looks like one of those winter retreat houses one would find in the alpines .
a comfortable long chair padded with oak and positioned towards the warm embers of the fireplace a kitchen set and counters lined with utensils and games and a set of stairs leading to a bedroom and bathroom on the upper floor .
she rests in front of the fireplace and i take a good look of myself in the bathroom 's mirrors a raggedy tired mess of a summoner currently frozen after spending hours out in the winter 'night ' trying to save both himself and the most important person to him from an uncertain situation .
her christmas attire has lost its shine now disheveled and messed up from the brief period of digging she did .
her modestly downcast eyes shows signs of fatigue and she 's definitely not the chipper giggling girl that showed up earlier today .
after washing my face at the sink i approach her .
she slumps into the long chair absentmindedly staring at the flickering flames .
i sit next to her and ask in the softest tone i can muster
her lips slightly curves a smile but her tone betrays it .
you know you 're slipping back into the old you again .
the one who goes 'hurr durr serious face ' most of the time . ''
in this kind of situation who would not do so ?
if anything you 're the strange one for being so lively . ''
i 'm really threading on a thin line here .
so i make myself sound elated and do finger guns pointing at her with a wide smile .
hey as long as you 're by my side i 'll get through anything come hell and high water . ''

i think fetishes based in degradation/humiliation as subjectively experienced are ... problematic to say the least .
i think they indicate a weak broken human being .
yes this includes women too and i do n't care about the gender combination at hand .
if you get off on being made to feel worthless or insignificant you have a problem .
i should clarify however this is very specifically about the subjective experience of the person in question .
if they have a fetish for x experience x as defilement and degradation of them and get off over that that 's a problem .
if x has a subjectively different meaning to them then that 's the meaning which matters for my analysis/evaluation .
cuckoldry as we see it practiced is frankly about a man fetishizing his own emasculation and humiliation including ethnic humiliation .
we ca n't pretend that there is n't that disturbing racial subtext about white women needing bbc to be fulfilled and all this 'white extinction ' stuff being fetishized .
i honestly ca n't see the fetish as anything other than an outgrowth of white guilt and eroticizing one 's own inferiority/patheticness .
even if we take away the ethnic subtext there 's still a man getting off on his own perceived inadequacy .
rather its a man who 's very happy to have such an exceptionally hot and sexually uninhibited woman in his life .
hotwifing is not about a man degrading himself but about a man experiencing pride in just how hot a wife he has .
i think its telling that cuckoldry gets tons of press but hotwifing does n't .
its almost like the priority is the humiliation of white men .

on one hand super 12 seems like another way of making the games of teams ranked 13-16 meaning less .
on the other hand the weaker teams get more meaningful games .
what they could have done is have 4 pools of four teams each and then have two knock outs .
1 for top 8 teams and another for bottom 8 teams .
that way the small teams get to play with the big teams and the small teams also have something to fight for after that .
or if they feel knockout means too few games then have super eight in two pools for top 8 teams .
so every team will get to play 6 games before semi finals .

i honestly have never heard of anyone using visual studio for java but i 'm open to hearing opinions from more experienced developers
or were the 3 players listed in title speculated to have other plans .
the sparse spanish guitar throughout the game is godly .
i think there 's a guide you can follow .
downloading hitman 1 demo or trial and get hitman 2 .

i 'll never understand the people who wait 5 minutes for someone to load their car put the cart away strap their kids in and hopefully not sit in the car for a minute before they leave just to save 30 seconds of walking .

how is the outside so bad but the inside good ?
i picked up about 8 iie 's that looked like this outside missing keys filthy and corrosion around the keyboard base .
sadly the inside has just as much corrosion and track rot !
but that picture is really interesting because it 's different from the rest .
it 's not just scrolling through the stupid pics to sort out the blow your load worthy ones .
i 'm with you guys until the end of time .
set up remote desktop of her pc so you can do things remotely from your home and she can watch you do it real time .
windows inbuilt remote desktop does n't work so well in me experience .
individuals do not have cases '' or press charges .
if a crime occurs the police investigate it and if it seems as if the law was broken they can arrest the person .
at that point the case is given to the prosecutor who uses the evidence and statements the police collected and decides what charges would be brought .
at that point they either reach a plea or go to trial .
someone yelling threats in a bar without any physical contact like you describe is not assault in md .
assault is harmful unwanted physical contact meant to inflict injury .
while possible for threats to be defined as battery if the victim is put in fear of harm it is not likely the police or prosecutor would pursue a case based on what you 've told us .
you are free to report it to the police all the same and can tell them you will cooperate if they pursue charges .
but it is not in your control to decide if they do or do not charge them .
people who are injured by another person are able to bring a civil lawsuit against the actor for their medical and other expenses directly caused by the assault .
here since she did not touch you and you are obviously not harmed you have nothing to sue for as you did not have to pay for medical attention or have another finanical loss .
people can not just sue others because they did something wrong .
there needs to be damages to recover to be made whole .
you really dont know how to talk in context do you ?
ultra rare haha you just ripped off his pants lol

the difference is that google xbox and playstation all allow you to use software that does not go through their store .

i am not sure about stream so left that one off .
i knew i 'd seen this concept somewhere before haha
i guess it 's not uncommon for private entities to bend to the will of whatever party/person is in power currently .

i think it 's incredibly dark and a difficult novel to read not just because of the violence or the language but because of the stagnant plot .

you 're making assumptions of your own there and fwiw its for more than economic reasons that i would want rid of the monarchy .
but there 's no way to categorise how much money is spent in relation to the monarchy i agree that this study dismissing it entirely is wrong but other studies that claim its all down to the monarchy is also false .
the whole shocking cost thing would morally be very different if it was a public venue rather than the home of one of britain 's richest families .
it could be used as a museum or something similar if they vacated .
the idea of ease of transition personally does n't interest me .

i assume the tc is n't referring to the big retail store packs or boxes sold w/o box toppers ie .
it 's the amount of sealed boxes that are nearly nonexistent .
it 's all about the box toppers and the fact the packs are see-thru makes the sealed boxes even more attractive as that 's the only way to get a genuinely not searched box topper .

to be honest i have n't looked at any models myself .
so i am taking the whole man-made global warming on faith .
and eg even convincing yourself of something as trivial as the shape of the earth or the distance between earth and moon or earth and sun from first principles and your own experiments is n't trivial and is a fun exercise we did with the physics knowledge we had available in high school .
the other potentially even more important bit is that global warming is not actually going to be that bad .
perhaps it 's gon na cost us a perpetual 10 of gdp by the end of the century .
10 of gdp is gigantic in absolute terms but it 's also only a few years of economic growth and so it might be more important to invest in eg malaria treatment or better infrastructure for developing countries now than care about a 10 impact on their and our rich descendants .
or at least that trade-off needs to be talked about and is not trivial .

actually i have n't seen a dc movie since the nolan batmen and did n't know aquaman had been in anything before and i thought it was really refreshing how they basically skipped out on us watching his becoming aquaman except for a few training scenes .
the new economy is great fun for like the first 10 planets or so .
the old sector ai 's biggest problem was that it did n't understand tile resources .
the solution for this was literally just one line of text a change which turned the old tiles into planet features
this one line of text allows tile deposits to be collected regardless of what building was on top .
its fine you get the energy deposit and the mine 's output .
add this one line of text and now deposits are a planet 's base value .
the planet 's production can never fall below this base value .
buildings can only ever improve from baseline resources never detract from it .
then from there it really did n't matter what the sector ai did .
the sector ai also used to collect taxes from its owned territory .
you could have 50 colonizes in the same sector and it ran so smoothly you never had to look at the sector ever again .
add the new system to the sector and you were done for the entire rest of the game .
the sector ai was good enough to get the job done .
the new sector ai is n't even good enough .

pythons can be dangerous in certain situations but they are n't aggressive snakes .
in most encounters they 'd rather try to flee first .
but if you get too close unknowingly or provoke one you might be in trouble especially if it 's a large individual say 3 metres or more .
you see while pythons are n't venomous they have lots of long sharp teeth https boneclones.com/product/python-skull-bc-118 that curve backwards .
when the python strikes at prey these teeth sink in preventing it from struggling free .
sometimes a person ends up getting too close to a python https www.straitstimes.com/singapore/python-bites-woman-on-second-floor-of-hdb-block and it lashes out in self-defense .
it might just give a warning bite and then let go telling you do n't step on me back off '' .
or it might clamp its jaws and refuse to let go this is more likely to happen when it 's already being handled or if it thinks it 's gotten hold of a prey item .
in such a scenario getting it to let go can be really difficult in this incident https www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4037439 a pest control officer was handling a python and got bitten and took 5 minutes before the python 's jaws were pried open with a screwdriver .
the aftermath of a python bite can be really bloody https youtu.be/zbzimlwkro8 nsfw and require stitches http burmjunkies.com/showthread.php ? 7467-****high-def-extreme-bite-damage-pics-inside-no-kids-no-snacking-while-viewing nsfw .
in other cases people think they can easily handle a python and try to catch one but even if they manage to avoid getting bitten they might still get in trouble .
pythons are extremely strong and wild ones will usually put up a fierce struggle when caught .
if the python is large enough and manages to throw a coil around the person handling it it can start squeezing .
if you 're alone and the python has gotten a coil around your chest or worse your throat you 're in deep shit .
this has happened https www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/01/28/villager-who-attempted-to-snare-python-ends-up-crushed-to-death in neighbouring countries https www.nst.com.my/news/2017/02/213531/deadly-grip-python-kills-chicken-farm-worker with fatal consequences https www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/12/27/python-kills-security-guard-near-bali-luxury-hotel.html .
the general rule of thumb is that when it comes to handling large constrictors whether it 's pythons or anacondas you need at least one person for every metre of snake .
which is why you get these photos of several people standing in a row cradling a large python http www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-snake-ever captivity .
and finally there are the occasional reports https www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39427462 of pythons that have actually killed and swallowed adult humans https news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/python-snake-swallows-man-whole-indonesia these seem to involve pythons that were apparently 7 metres or longer .
i 'm not sure about the longest python ever found here in singapore but i have n't heard of any that have reached this size here .
having said all that if you do find a python you 're safe if you keep your distance .
if you spot one in a park or nature reserve or in a drain just admire it and leave it alone .
if it 's on a path or a road wait for it to cross or if it 's at risk of getting run over or hurt by someone else you could encourage it to move by using a long object to gently prod or nudge the tail .
do n't pull or touch the tail with your own hands because if the python is provoked and turns around you do n't want to be in striking range .
if the python is in an urban area like in someone 's home garden void deck coffeeshop etc. the best thing to do is to call the acres wildlife rescue hotline 97837782 they 'll send someone to rescue the snake and relocate it to a forested area where it 's less likely to get into trouble with people .
never try to handle it yourself for all the reasons i mentioned above and do n't call the police or pest control simply because they 're often not properly trained to handle snakes and might not only unnecessarily injure the python but also do things that put themselves or bystanders at risk of getting bitten .

i 've also said that end of the day the ones who will really bring down the straight white male patriarchy in america will be black feminists .
sure you 'll get the hardcore 4th wave white feminists doing their bit and of course one or two token asian american feminists but most of the heavy lifting will be done by black women .

feel free to resubmit your post and remember to flair it once it is posted .

do n't reply to me i 'm a bot .
whenever i do something or attach my name to some tasks that i 've performed or product that i 've created i make sure that i did it as well as possible that nobody can look at the thing that i did or the thing that i put my effort into and think badly of me .
like you said and is the case with most things it 's all in the execution .
washing with only water is perfectly fine in the shower if there 's a visible mess or you 're especially stinky i suggest aveno sensitive body wash .
i use it on places where bacteria build up like pits shoulders and upper back and a bit between my legs .
if it 's sandal or dress shoes or i 've been sweating in my shoes my feet also get soap .
in heat waves i 'll do a bit more all over work with a wash cloth everywhere .
note wash your hands with soap frequently and before using them to wash any other part of your body .
no point in transferring germs from the things you 've been touching all day to places they would n't otherwise get !
and it 's flu session where am so i wash my hands extra frequently like the moment i get home or am about to eat .

i 'm not very representative probably first of because im more of a former ap but the critique still resonates with me a lot and is still part of my way of looking at the world .
i used to be an 'anarcho-traveler ' type hopping trains squatting dumpstering shoplifting learning earth skills and plant id and reading a lot of anthropology and doing activism with indigenous solidarity eco defense antifascist etc ... some of which took me to some very wild and beautiful places and other kinds of profound experiences .
then i got involved with leftists and it basically ruined my life ... so its very different now .
i live in a rural area i garden i hike a lot .
i eat a 'pegan ' type diet mainly because it keeps my immune system from going haywire .
still read a lot and follow native issues closely read a lot more in philosophy spirituality and history now .
i sometimes think we may be in an age of the world where the main work for decent souls beyond surviving is mourning .
though i realize this may be a self-serving justification for a kind of hermit-like quietism i 'm sort of stuck with for various reasons .
i ca n't sort of will myself into being a primitive person and i ca n't deactivate the global death machine .
even as limited as the frame of my life has become within that it helps to have a greater sense of what it 's all about and why things are so fucked .
and to be sort of attuned to where i can exist in a way that is somewhat authentic compassionate natural and does some good or at least not too much harm .
best if you do that part yourself then beg for someone to come hit you ... . bugs really are ridiculous in this otherwise fun game .
it 's not out of the question to say that 's the only one they feel is worth that pick .
i would n't think they 'd prioritize that position in the first round but it has enough value that if a guy fell for reasons the steelers were ok with at 20 why not ?
people put too much stock into first round picks taken in the back half of the round anyway .
it 's about what they can develop into in the future .

the first c8f is the single 18650 version and we did not sell on amazon now .

i thought mgs1 would be too dated for me to get into but even though its at the bottom of the list i really liked the game .
i just reading about you in that issue last week .
ugh i honestly rant to myself a lot about this but reddit is full of the most unfunny guys who constantly spit out the same jokes over and over again see next mrs obama get down !
and circlejerk themselves for making the most painful cringey jokes .
then the same dudes get rly mad at women for not being entertaining enough '' on dates etc .
even though ime on reddit muacj and other women driven subs are usually the funniest .
combine all of that with us ladies gay men whoever the fuck yall are just out here trying to have a good time but goofy ass men come in here and think they deserve an award for their penis ? ?
if you like jerking or makeup or whatever then great comment upvote post etc .
but do n't go out of your way to tell me you 're a guy and expect me to kiss your ass .
the worst part is they bring their unfunny sexualizing asses into these subs and just ruin the whole vibe .
not to mention how condescending they are about womenz actually being funny '' .
i was able to find the episode thanks to your post .
i thought they were talking about oikawa over-practicing or something but the kyoutani thing makes a lot of sense .

the ball landed really close to the foul line entirely possible he thought it was out because of a bad angle or something .
also possible he went on auto pilot and reached over with everyone else .

this allows for more variations of posts to be found when looking up the discussions for the series .
for example if the title of a post uses vol ch the post can not be found with the search bar if the user types out volume chapter .
however if the post is titled with volume chapter the post is searchable with vol ch .

we had a perfectly manageable system in d1 with a page for our current missions and pursuits .
the only thing i wanted to change from that was the ones we tracked get moved to the front page .
instead i have to juggle more than two dozen bounties while i go after sleeper nodes/pinnacle weapons/unlocking forges and hold on to a talisman that for all intents and purposes should be just something my guardian has and not take up another slot .
more importantly why are you talking like a neanderthal ?
so we would be taking on over 15 mil in cap hit to take on a 31 year old locker room cancer that is completely reliant on speed and quickness .
think about that ... an aging speed and quickness reliant wr who flips the fuck out and blames everyone but himself every time anything goes wrong playing for a franchise that always has weird shit go wrong while playing for a coach/gm that wont put up with guys picking fights and starting bullshit .
oh and we would have to mortgage our future for a two year window at success while praying he doesnt go any more crazy than he already has proven to be .
we need a solid slot wr for a lot less money coupled with a complete te to round out the offense .
that lets us tackle our o-line depth while still going after improvements on defense .
with patricia as hc our offense needs to be more efficient than explosive .
shorten the game a bit get points more consistently and be able to work the clock when needed .
wait what other reason is there to bring up lobsters having hierarchies if that is n't the implication ?
animals do lots of shit humans do n't obviously humans do have hierarchies and always have but you get what i 'm saying what lobsters do/do n't do is n't necessarily relevant to humanity and it seems like a huge non sequitur if you are n't trying to make some point about human society when you mention it .

reddit hates this because they have this irrational fear that dozens of women will suddenly accuse them of rape but how many times have 30 accounts from unrelated people all been made up to frame someone ?
there is no logical explanation that does n't involve him being a sexual predator .

but i take it once a day with my redbull before work i work swing shift i stay tired i get worse withdrawls headaches mostly from lack of redbull than i ever have kratom .
my boyfriend is however an addict meth junkie and he takes it the same as i do once a day .
and hes been clean for almost a year and a half .
i think kratom is tricky to abuse ... we use it as a stimulant so if u take to much or add a dose later u are always risking goin down instead .

i think it should 've looked somewhat like how dalek thay 's back panels looked after he sacrificed them and replaced them .
just bare metal with welding lines but still in proper proportions to the regular body with scrapes dents and rust here and there to seal the scrap look rather than making it look wonky and outta proportion .
or maybe a dalek with missing bits or a dalek that was badly decayed and replaced bits of itself with alternate components while still looking like a dalek .

yeah the discounts mlms give their distributors are very small so they 're basically selling it to their family friends at a very similar price they bought it for themselves .
the mlm sets the prices so high for shitty products because the products are red herrings .
the products take them outside of the definition of pyramid scheme even though the only way you can make any money with them is recruiting a lot of people .
mlms make the most money off the huns not off the people the huns sell to .
the huns have to buy a vastly overpriced starter kit pay for training conferences and transport then keep paying every month to meet a quota just so they can actually make commission and make any money at all ! .
the company buys the products from alibaba at wholesale prices the younique brush that was around 15¬¢ to buy and they sell for 32 for example then sells it to the distributors at an insane markup that no sensible person would pay because they 're selling the experience .
they know there 's a massive turnover in distributors for their companies but those starter kit sales keep putting money in their pockets especially for companies like llr with 4000 starter kits .
the majority of huns are n't making any profit off this at all .
they 're also pretty dumb and gulliable and/or in a desperate situation .

i am speaking for myself here but you can see your back and other things that have been out of your field of vision by constructing the environment by what you saw earlier and other senses and filling the gaps .
as for the back you know which clothes you wear and you have an idea of what the back of your head looks like and the take the inputs from your movements to recreate the scene .
it is all speculation but it certainly is a real thing to see yourself from the back as well as dreaming or remember dreams in 3rd person .

people with money will always be looking to lend to those without for a fee .
where it goes wrong is when a central authority can create these loans out of nothing the current system because if we all use that money we all are robbed by the creation of more of it inflation .
fractional reserve loans hurt everyone but the one making the fake money real lending such as loaning out gold and bitcoin benefits everyone .

the only case scenario for supporting 32bit would be for the intel atom z3735 which unfortunately only allows 32bit windows install but allows 64bit linux .
either way those cpu 's are already slow and their successors supports 64bit .

i do n't know a lot about it but bel canto is a style of singing that was used in opera .

this does seem like the kind of thing that would be very helpful and the sort of thing that sighted players probably often take for granted and do n't even think about how useful it is for us to be able to quickly scan through history visually .
safety is the most important part of gun ownership but too many people i know with licenses get far too comfortable around their weapons .
i 've stopped shooting with some friends because i did n't trust their gun safety .
i do n't care that i saw you pull the slide check the barrel and chamber pop the clip and saw that empty and the safety is on .
you do n't put the clip back in pop the slide forward and then hold the gun at your side and turn to talk to me .
keep the gun pointed down range at all times and nothing less than that is acceptable .
it all depends in you can separate the content from the creator
this is exactly how its been working in world of warcraft for a long time no issues with it .
of course this will be lost on deaf ears but nobody is blaming russians for everything . ''
russia attacked the united states by subjecting the country to a military-grade psyops operation with the intent of electing an idiot over whom they had substantial leverage via years of working him as an intelligence asset a useful idiot '' in their terms .
this is consistent with everything we know about russia 's geopolitical aims .
the blame placed on russia is proportionate to the severity of that attack .
your bitrate has to be lower than your upload speed otherwise you will get dropped frames which result in choppy video .
so test the connection with something like 1600 kbps bitrate .
if it 's smooth then you have the culprit .
the problem then would be that even 2 mbps upload is quite low for streaming at 720p60 .
you 'll probably have to drop to 720p30 and even then fast paced games would be an issue .

my only complaint is that there are 10 seconds of logos before the trailer even starts and considering that those 10 seconds are when you need to grab people it is n't a great start .
i 'd put them at the end if i were in your position .
one thing you can do is have two different stories .
story a is your real situation who you only tell to people in your league and above .
story b is your fake or half truth story you tell to everyone else .
i think this is pretty similar to what you 're currently doing except your leaving out one crucial element .
you need to tell the group a people exactly what you 're doing .
so as soon as you tell them story a be sure to mention how you do n't tell that to many people and you only tell story b to most people .
that way when a people and b people meet you have nothing to worry about because the a people will back you up when you start talking about story b .

ricochet rounds is 5 range and 10 stability the kicker is it has a built in zoom magnification not stated in the description essentially this is like having rangefinder built in for free and will boost range significantly so think of it more like 15 to range .
you will have longer ranges before date drop off and the hand cannon will feel more 'consistent ' .
light mag is 5 to range and 10 to reload and i can see why the reload boost over stability would otherwise seem preferable .

after a few hours we were flying back into town down i-70 probably moving 110-120 when we passed a cop well hidden in the center median .
we exited just after that and my turn was just a half-mile after the exit so we parted ways and i went home .
he called me an hour or so later hey man did you even see that cop ? ''
apparently she caught him about a mile past my turn and threw the book at him 115 in a 55 speed contest evading arrest etc..
she asked him who the other rider was and he just told her i was some random kid trying to keep up with him .
someone asked me where syria was and i froze for about five seconds and then blurted out africa .
maysville around madison sq park is really nice without being over the top .
great vibe and drinks especially if you like whiskey .
my coworker also takes all of his first dates here lol .
i always set a stop on the sled even if it 's only for one piece and no matter how carefully i measure i always cut a piece of scrap first to check it 's right .
this also tends to 'transition ' my thinking from the measurement i need to set to the measurement the piece has to be .
when making drawers out of plywood and they all have the same length and width i rout the necessary grooves and rabbet the edges of pieces long enough i can then just slice off the height of each one .
in my current project this means having to pick the proper side only eight times rather than forty .
the fewer decisions i make the fewer will be wrong .
i also do the largest boards first so if i make a mistake i can cut it down to the size of the next-smaller piece .
probably my biggest thing is using a cad program to draw everything up and fitting the pieces together digitally before turning on a saw .
i do n't usually make the same mistake twice but i 'm sort of a master when it comes to finding new ones .
this is still how i enter dire maul ! !
yuh that 's what i meant thought you were op at first

a funny story worked as a digital vp for a company and was laid off and had my department divided up from under me .
fast forward about a year and their major enterprise level site that i was responsible for goes down .
lost 1000s in sales and advertising dollars and was majorly embarrassing to the company .
i did it well so well they did n't understand what i was doing because it was all behind teh scenes .
they never asked what i was doing and assumed i was n't needed .
they even reassigned my 2 who knew where the bodies were burried but put them in a position that it was not thier responsibility .
continuity of service and performance is valuable in the face of the alternative .
yes i can i do that the first time before add snow on them and with snow it 's better than without in my opinion
whatever it takes to get booger flicked out of our lives .
just a clarification there 's a deep history of logic and philosophy in religion .
literally centuries of thinkers who for a long time had access to the best education the world had to offer and used it to create logical arguments for and even against religion .
what they are not generally are empiricists or naturalists which i think is what people mean now when they say logic or reason .
will there be another chance or is that it ?
pretty cool but they should 've just added the same one as criterion and oblivion .

question 1 anyone know the average shelf-life of retinol give or take ?
question 2 for those who mix to 's resveratrol 3 ferulic acid 3 with one of their vitamin c products how much r+e do you use ?
re 1 i need to make a deciem/the ordinary order and since i 'd rather throw in a filler '' item than pay shipping i 'm thinking of getting an extra '' bottle of retinol .
that is to say i 'm buying retinol 0.2 in squalane to use immediately but considering a bottle of retinol 0.5 in squalane to store for use when the 0.2 is empty/done .
most sources i can find claim it to be good for about six months after opening but i ca n't find anything about unopened .
it 'd be stored in a dark place that stays around 67-73f year-round if it matters .
i can store it in its box in a mini-fridge but if it would n't make a big difference i 'd rather just keep it in my backstock/backup '' drawers .
re 2 i have the 23 suspension ha spheres and want to mix r+e with it immediately before use obviously but ca n't find any info on amounts or a possible ideal ratio .
some of these post deserve it seriously why are we posting meetup requests and 7-am pictures you took of dubai .

so i 've been backpacking before but now my best friend asked me if i want to go backpacking with him and his sister .

trump is in clear violation of the emoluments clause the same clause that required carter to sell his peanut farm .
in my opinion trump should be impeached for that day 1 of democrats controlling the house .
there is no reason to wait the same way you get suspicious if a ref calls a late flag .
furthermore there are no limits on how many flags can be called or how many times you can impeach as far as i know .
every day the senate should be sent a new impeachment bill from the house until trump liquidates his business or resigns .
i can down 8-10 pretty easy on the average night .
im starting to think that might be my issue ...

it 's rather apparent you wo n't concede that any aspect of your argument is flawed .
i 've provided you with valid sources which you decided not to look into .
i 've given you proper definitions of terms that prove the correlation between merit '' and competence '' and decided to disregard it and throw it out the window .
also if i even prove something to you you immediately pivot and bring up another argument .

if you are omnivorous newari thakali and limbu dishes may be palatable .
if you are a vegan you may like dishes preferred by followers of krishna pranami .
strangely i do n't see people mention marwari dishes in this thread .
although the origins of the marwari ethnicity can be traced back to india there has been a sizable presence of the community for several generations now and i personally love their vegetarian cuisine so much so that i think marwari dishes are already some of the most popular mainstream dishes found across the country .
there is also the streetside naan-roti joints you may want to explore which was firstly introduced in nepal by the punjabi sikh community but now has its own very popular localized version in nepal preferred by people from all different backgrounds in the country .
sorry you 're right this is more like mainstream politics in australia .

well it 's way better than a crosley and will be good for long time .
but looking into the future perspective you should upgrade to something like rega planar 3 it is way more upgradable .
in april 1999 david copeland a neo-nazi planted a series of nail bombs over 13 days .
his attacks which were aimed at london's black bangladeshi and gay communities resulted in three dead and more than 100 injured .
copeland was a former member of two far right political groups the british national party bnp and the national socialist movement .
it was to cause a racial war in this country .
there 'd be a backlash from the ethnic minorities then all the white people will go out and vote bnp . ''
in july 2007 robert cottage a former bnp member was convicted for possessing explosive chemicals in his home ‚Äì described by police at the time of his arrest as the largest amount of chemical explosive of its type ever found in that country .
in june 2008 martyn gilleard a british nazi sympathizer was jailed after police found nail bombs bullets swords axes and knives in his flat.also in 2008 nathan worrell was found guilty of possession of material for terrorist purposes and racially aggravated harassment .
he was described by anti-terror police as a dangerous individual '' .
the court heard that police found books and manuals containing recipes '' to make bombs and detonators using household items such as weedkiller at worrell 's flat .
in july 2009 neil lewington was planning on waging a terror campaign using weapons made from tennis balls and weedkiller against those he classified as non british '' .
in 2012 the british home affairs committee warned of the threat of far right terrorism in the uk claiming it had heard persuasive evidence '' about the potential danger and cited the growth of similar threats across europe .
members of combat 18 c18 a neo-nazi organisation based on the concept of leaderless resistance '' have been suspected in numerous deaths of immigrants non-whites and other c18 members .
between 1998 and 2000 dozens of members were arrested .
a group calling itself the racial volunteer force split from c18 in 2002 retaining close links to its parent organization.some journalists believed that the white wolves were a c18 splinter group alleging that the group had been set up by del o'connor the former second-in-command of c18 and member of skrewdriversecurity .
c18 attacks on immigrants continued through 2009.weapons ammunition and explosives were seized by police in the uk and almost every country in which c18 was active .
in 2016 jo cox the member of parliament mp for the batley and spen constituency was murdered by thomas mair who was motivated by far-right political views and had connections to several far-right organisations in the uk us and south africa .
they used to make couples hold hands then jump over the fire for some pagan fertility stuff or that may of been something i read in game of thrones .
you have to factor in the environment in which they live .
germans have free healthcare very good quality excellent public transport clean cities and governments which provide a social net in case something goes wrong .
they also enjoy cheaper prices than a lot in the eu .
greece has some of these policies but public hospitals here are a horrible mess cities are so dirty and toxic with only basic sanitation services and dirty parks .
they have huge potholes and cars parked on every side and on every sidewalk .
public transport with the exception of the metro in athens is a mess .
buses are never on time and they are old .
the government 's social net is almost nonexistent and public education is a mess too .
with that in mind a poor german while poor for your standards is much richer compared to a poor person in many eu countries .
yes the vast majority of people in greece own at least a house and a parcel of land somewhere in the country but their quality of life is considerably worse .
yeaaaaa ... ..for those wondering it 's the picture to the right .

the way i look at it is coachella has had months to put this together .
i think there were some really cool ways they could have done this .
every 15 minutes post a new artist on twitter from 10am pst to 7pm pst .
they could have released the lineup around 7pm pst or waited until tomorrow morning to drop it if they really wanted to give those lesser known people some attention .
this just feels like they lost kanye west and did n't have a back-up plan so they randomly sent out a few tweets of lesser known artists .
it does n't feel like it was well planned and i think people are noticing that .
they have a right to vent their frustrations to one of the largest music festivals in the world .
on a side note it just blows me away they did n't have a back-up plan to kanye west ... idk just feels like a mess .
i just see why people are and i understand that paying 450 dollars to hear about coleboyy is n't some people 's idea of fun suspense .
yeah you guys spent two decades trying to investigate clinton with dozens on investigations resulting in zero charges .

i read your cross-post that had more detail about the conversations with your father in the aftermath of you going back to college .
you were valid for leaving no matter what your parents say .
when you go home next i would suggest you start recording your mother with a phone or voice recorder .
this will not be the last time you will be blamed for something you did n't do .
furthermore you need to understand that narcissism exists on a spectrum .
the statements your mom made indicates that she is on that spectrum more than the average human .
i am not sure where you are located but i advise you to consider seeking a therapist experienced with narcissism at your university if they have these services .
they will help understand your mother give your direct support in establishing boundaries and help you practice methods of communication .
this might seem little to you but your parents should not be calling or contacting you every day you wrote this in malicious compliance .
once you enter professional life this habit could hurt your career .
it might not even end with calling you it could escalate to calling your boss or even showing up to where you work unannounced .
you need to find a way to stop this habit because it is manipulative and controlling .

it 's the worst my partner and i had bite marks all over our arms for a few weeks .
high-pitched when they do it too hard it teaches them bite inhibition and stop playing/petting for a second so they learn bites lead to no fun and if they are chewing stuff you do n't want them to get bitter apple spray .
it 'll end soon just be patient and consistent .
even when it feels like you are repeating things over and over .
i think my jaw got dislocated at that point .

on the garmin connect website you can add a widget to a dashboard to track goal progress you can also have monthly or weekly goals and track multiple widgets if you like .
if you want to track goals in a mobile app you can sync your garmin activities to strava .
i actually like the strava goal tracker a little better it will break your goal up into weekly targets automatically and on the website it tells you how far ahead or behind track you are based on evenly dividing your goal over the days of the year .
unfortunately the goal tracking is part of one of the paid strava summit packs .

my moral value comes from my judgment based on what 's the better good if that makes sense for the particular circumstance .

first time i ever threw a guy out at home plate from deep center with a single throw no cutoff happened that year .
not too sure myself i own two but both very cheap .
there are a lot of really cheap nylons out there as they 're popular starter guitars .
there are less good ones as proper classical guitarists are more rare .
you 'll start to pay a lot more for anything a bit artisan anything that 's got a cutaway shape anything made of exotic woods ...
i 'd say stick with cheap and simple play a few in store to see what feels right .
look up how to play an e minor chord and try playing that and gently strumming the strings .
i imagine if given 2-3 options you 'll probably have a gut instinct for which one you want .
unless you 're made of money do n't bother spending loads on your first guitar .
it 's been two weeks since a blog post .
this is brilliant your setup sounds really similar to mine !
i use an external soundcard now with all my real synths running through a mixer into one channel .
i do rather want a neutron i must say .
i am but a simple man and i love the volca beats as it was a birthday gift from my girlfriend .
the kick is deep and smooth and the hats are superb ... but many reviews you 'll read are correct about one thing the snare is embarrassing .
so much like you i have to run the vb in with my other synths making delay and reverb kind of awkward because they have to apply to the drums too .
to get around this i 've started using the vb mainly for the hats and all of my other drums are done in ableton live on a separate channel using live 's drum sampler .
most of the time i use linndrum samples because i freaking love the linndrum but ca n't afford one come on behringer ... .
we have a weekly post about the 6 billion here i 'm so tired it .
like this sub ca n't go a week without mentioning it ?
it 's a 100 chance of drop from erchius though how have you never gotten it before ?
they still have a ways to go in rebuilding trust and proving that they 're actually committed to more sustainable practices but it 's a step in the right direction .
i do n't necessarily support danone but i think them pursuing this is so much better for the world than them not pursuing this .
in my opinion big companies trying to achieve b certification does n't devalue b certification process it adds to it .
because the more that big traditional companies pursue sustainable certifications the more likely the rest of that industry is to look them and think shit if those guys are doing it maybe we should too . ''
if that happens enough pretty soon you 've got a whole lot of businesses that have cut down on their environmental footprint adopted better hiring practices etc .
but if it keeps carbon out of the atmosphere and/or helps encourage a fair trade market then i personally do n't think it 's such a bad thing
but if goetia has succeed then his world of deathless wo n't getting erase by araya ?
because in his ideal world humanity can not be advance and that timeline will become a lostbelt ?
and bestbuy will honor the amazon price if you still have gc to receive an additional 20 off !
yes you should play either azur lane or girls frontline .
if you dont have lot of time i suggest girls frontline because there are some qol features that save time and less clicking like save/load team formation battle planning mode smart enhancement smart retiring auto repeat logistic/comissions .
i 'm surprised there are a lot of former sumo wrestlers in the nfl .
they seem like they could make great linemen with their combination of size footwork and strength
make her explain herself and the appalling decisions she made like taking money off the mafia death bed conversions to christianity and the massive lack of healing she done .
just need bluetooth to sync an awesome invention for those without data or wifi .

but range items will make the ice bullets and arctic wind have a longer range .
especially if they manipulate people pointlessly just for the feeling of control .
do n't spam judge that 's the most important tip i guess
i think most of the 'non-human ' races normally have battle facial expressions https i.imgur.com/cfss0ep.jpg https i.imgur.com/cfss0ep.jpg
then the humanoids always look like they 're taking a stroll through a mall .
but witch elves are some of the worst they 're constantly screaming like mad-women yet zoom in and they all have the same bored facial expression

it 's sodium and do n't tell me i ca n't do something just because of my reddit account name
where do you get the information is there a website or something ?
i was so happy to see it back but i have to agree with you on this one the card is nuts .
making things unguessable is entirely irrelevant if they 're human/machine readable .
at that point there 's no relevance to security whether it 's guessable because you can just access it 10000x faster than guessing it anyway
a 4 digit pin on a door is guessable and 8008 might be extra guessable but if it 's written next to the keypad you are n't gon na start at 0000 and work your way up ...

hey in no particular order can you please list eleven herbs and spices along with their exact proportions ?
i do not find mari kondo to be a person i am inclined to like .
i also dislike her attitude of throwing away and not trying to reuse sell give away or gift away .
she is a liberal/feminsit leaning person and does not tell you to honor other peoples belongings especially not our husbands .
a disrespectful/non-vigilant woman might not see anything bad in pressuring her husband into sorting out his belongings or even do it herself !
just as bad is inviting something gets thrown out because you do not love it but your husband might deem it essential .
one needs to be pretty reflective and firm in the rpw before daring to move with this .
most of these decisions went 5-4 on party lines anyways
the ryzen barely matches it and often not even then when overclocked .
i watched dozens of benchmarks before buying an 8400 for this reason .
have they called an above waist high no ball at all this season ?
i assumed they did n't exist anymore as the umpires seem to think they do n't exist .
you are looking for a 900 1000 dollar streaming build and 9000 dollar dl build ?
why not use the dl as your all purpose machine then lol
well of course i believe someone who calls themselves a twat nozzle and screams fake news '' over the word of natca .
the backlash against patreon and all their censorship lately will be huge too .
it is n't literally imperial vs. metric but it is conceptually imperial vs. metric .
for a new user it kind of depends on what you want to do .
i went with moa because i fucking hate mrad .
for my brain and the distances that i shoot i can get away with 1-inch per 100 yards '' .
that is n't perfect but out to 600 yards shooting steel or 350 yards shooting a deer the difference between 6 '' and 6.28 '' is fuck it .
scopes are either 1/4moa or 1/2moa so the math of i need to go 3 inches up 3 times 4 is 12 clicks '' is super easy in my brain .
so 3 '' higher is 3 divided by .36 so ... 8.3 clicks .
and tbh i 'm not 100 sure that mil description is correct since when i try to think in mils my brain just goes to mush .
the short version is moa works with my brain better .
yeah man if op is n't interested or if we come to an agreement for sure !

most of the few things of his i have seen try to promote a positive identity for men by diminishing the identity of woman .
then again i find the idea that there is a corollary between masculinity/femininity and personal identity to be bullshit anyway ... our culture is way to hard on men that do n't follow the typical social norms of what is considered masculine ... and the fault lays at the feet of those who bash people for not being an 'ideal version ' of a man ... .nothing from peterson i have seen suggests that to be the issue therefore i do n't take his thoughts very seriously on the matter .

i used the search bar and did n't find anything useful thanks anyway .
imagine being proud of assaulting a young girl on a plane .
my order was shipped out 12/17 and i paid extra for xpresspost .
truth be told customs held onto the package for over 10 days so the shipping itself was actually pretty quick .
it got delivered just 2 days after it made it though customs .
since the holiday season is over shipping should n't be as busy .
he will be out in a years time anyways .
the temperature of the earth used to be much cooler .
the dinosaurs caused global warming and eventually had to leave for another planet .
of course it 's not bad to read them .
they 're also misogynistic glorify abuse and perpetuate inappropriate stereotypes about native americans .
so there are some very real uncomfortable criticisms about the books .
but look for the ways they show inappropriate treatment of women of relationships and of native americans and just be aware that what she 's showing is inappropriate not normal and most certainly not romantic and you 'll be fine .
prisoners were n't burned alive as far as i know .
he doens't provide as much early game control and tempo as he did before .
i have n't played him to the changes either but if you have n't played him in a while getting used to the void no longer mini stunning and daytime changes you will definitely feel that .
now he has a real ultimate and aoe silence which is different .
maybe worse maybe more situational maybe even better but different nonetheless .
he does n't win the lane but he is still a high armor stout shield hero .
you can not roam as hard once night time hits .
i think you have to choose between being useful during the first 5 minutes or the first night time .
if you just pull 4 times and get the maximum farm from the small camp that 's the best you can do in terms of levels .
but if you do that you can not pressure a dual lane trade hits with night stalker 's bad movespeed but high armor and hp .
when night stalker first started getting nerfed the build that created the most farm for me was a dominator build .
it gave you a creep and if you 're good with micro can amplify your support game a lot .
it can give you what the jungle wants to give you like ice armor creeps or alpha wolf for faster farming .
or it can just give you something your offlaner or safe laner should want in terms of tower pressure .
but even if you go urn into rushing '' and aghs just makes sure you know what you team needs .
small stuff like glimmer oov or even a blight stone can help the team a lot .
lastly do n't measure your impact in terms of kda the hero is about silences and vision not damage .
if you want damage in a 4 pick lina or a hero with high single target dps .
or pick a high damage aoe teamfight hero like titan .
thats honestly hilarious i watched this for the first time a couple hours ago because it was on my recommended .

how are you gon na be here talking about an unreasonably high percentage of the hottest women '' being fake-ably hot demanding unnatural obsessed and having ridiculous and stupid standards and still act like your very attitude is n't more of a turn off for them than anything else .
i hope you realize that 99 of women even if they are not the hot instagram models or the naturally angelic girl next door types you pine for see type of dehumanisation and fake-woke tone as the reddest of red flags .
i am not trying to say you are an evil person or dangerous or whatever but from a girl 's point of view reading something like this is incredibly unpleasant .
if you are having trouble attracting the type of girl you are interested in i feel for you and i wish you luck but complaining on the internet will literally not change a thing .
go out and put the same effort in as those girls you talk about and then you can be picky too
i almost got tickets to the dome opener in 2006 and my stepdad almost broke the bank for us to go to miami in 2009

well also cause she 's gone through a ton of shit .
i was pretty into it around the 25 mark after the slow start then gradually lost interest until giving it up .
i am sort of curious if there 's some profound ending that causes a positive lasting impression but i ca n't be bothered to get there .
not sure how i feel about such a pixel basic game .
my hair was really blonde when i was a kid like almost white now it 's dark brown .
my brother had light brown hair when he was a kid now it 's pitch black .
it was probably the cancer that made it that way but still .
also my nephew had pitch black hair when he was born but now it 's light brown .
you 're trying to get away from your own point because you know it 's obviously wrong .
if shorts ran this place or even had more than 50 influence then positive articles and comments about apha would not be consistently upvoted .
just look at the top articles and top comments of this sub .
if they were even 50 they 're not even close shorts are more like 5 at most in here then the apha positivity would be around 0 total upvote/downvote ratio .
bad eyesight can cause people to drop things trip over unseen obstacles etc .
but to evaluate a card we look at its merits and demerits and being a 3 mana pw is a big merit that is easy to miss .
or rather it eliminates some of the biggest demerits associated with being a pw .
but when they come down on turn 3 it is difficult to have a board to pressure them .
in control decks pws are sorcery speed spells that can be taken advantage of .
but when you can cast them on turn 5 and leave up two mana for removal or counter things are different .
ultimately being a 3 mana pw does n't define a card the way being a 3 mana 5/4 does but it is still an important part of what the card is .
so you 're comfortable taking even a .01 chance your kid might be molested your statistic ?
unless you lock your child in a cage and never let them out that risk will not ever be 0 .

it 's easily countered which ca n't be said for any flash bang in any other game i 've played .
my first birth experience was pretty bloody ordinary tbh dazed and confused from a scheduled c-section justnomum had arrived from her european holiday to tell me that she was too young to be a grandmother then cried partner hung over and giving zero fucks not a lot of support from nursing staff so it really was a learning opportunity for this time around .
fh upon hearing this instantly was on-board with the idea of a post c-section birth plan .
and has been very supportive and helpful when it came to telling family about it .
i 'm just stunned that a person who i had thought was an ally and a friend is turning into this justno .
and if she keeps on the way she 's going i will go nuclear on her justno arse !

i have added albums via local files on my spotify such as tool and they scrobble just fine .

docile minds prone to superstition and whimsy are much easier to control .

so you think that he went temporarily insane because ... of their bad finances and the state of their relationship and wanting to be with his mistress ?
there is no evidence to say she was on her phone after she arrived home .
maybe yours does too she checked on them and something was seriously wrong and cue the emotional conversation .

biggest mistake i see which i was almost definitely guilty of in the past is the planet of hats '' trope .
for example a space-voyaging party lands on a planet and literally everyone on this planet wears the same hat .
furthermore this hat is usually the only defining feature of this planet and/or its inhabitants or the place is just a clone of another one with nothing but a hat to set them apart .
planet of hats can be applied to a populace literally every single person in a civilization has the same morals and religion a setting the entire nation is exclusively desert with no breaks but for an oasis epsiode or even a smaller element of a world all dark magic is purple and there 's no non-evil purple magic .
planet of hats is n't necessarily a bad thing but it often makes for an uncompelling or overly predictable world .
i see a ton of fantasy maps where makers have kingdoms that are exclusively a grassland a forest a mountain an evil land '' etc .
a solution to this pitfall is to replace your exclusively '' with predominantly '' and entertain that there will almost always be opposing or contrasting elements in anything .
so you 're a loser who walked halfway across the us ?
free stuff from playing the game i was playing anyway and pretty generous rewards .
ignore people moaning about their dislike for the free stuff .
if you had to go out of the way to do this itd be disappointing as not sure many people want or need another tier 6 sherman but everyone will achieve this so youre essentially gifting it to us all which is better than not !
plus the road to the thunderbolt has tons of awesome rewards .
i do n't think we 're on the reich track .
and it 's even worse in the original on ps2 because you ca n't skip cutscenes and that damn fight that rewards you with cure is hard as hell ...
shutting the fuck up is a terrific course of action in nearly any situation .
... some loot is drop-specific from certain enemies while others are earned by completing certain questlines .
it 's worth noting that loot is instanced and therefore ... ''
i wonder where this information even comes from and why no devs have mentioned this at all in the december streams but rather stating the opposite .
unless of course this is regarding lower-tier loot during the crit path/levelling process and dev statements in streams are only related to end game gear .
they also got the loot rarity order wrong so i reserve the right to dismiss the article as a whole .
... there will be rare weapons or equipment that will drop from specific encounters ... ''
so when you have not only myself but higher regarded magazines saying the same stuff ... . when does one stop saying the blue pen is red ?
i do n't know you so your word is worth as much to me as any other random person on the internet .
i prefer to only blindly trust information that 's directly quotable from an actual developer .
and even they can get things wrong sometimes so to a degree it 's all speculation until we 're actually playing the final release next month .
because of the vents it 's similar temps to a open bench system .

i mean i see a pretty girl and i think i 'd like to get to know her but then maybe she 'll turn out to be mean spirited or obsessive or troubled .
i do n't want to announce my intentions early on because because i want an easy escape route and not to be overly harsh if she 's not for me .
maybe it turns out she 'd make a good friend in the end rather than a partner .

when i first tried kratom i did n't like it although i did n't use it when i was withdrawing i used it shortly after doing some oxy thinking it would make it stronger not to mention it was some rip off 10x tincture from a head shop so i was n't impressed .
i did n't try it again until i had been a year clean from dope and this time around i ordered from one of the top vendors from back when r/kratom still allowed vendor discussion .
tbh these days 9/10 times is choose my normal dose of kratom over 30mg of oxy or a bag of dope .
i love green strains because they give me the stimulation i loved from oxy but without the crazy mood swings and brevity of oxy/dope highs .
i 've come to the conclusion that i 'll always need some form of mat .
drug and i 'd much rather take kratom than be hooked on suboxone again .
i 'm also one of the people who only get very mild wd 's from kratom though i know some people get wd 's just as bad as dope/oxy sub withdrawal from it but the most i get is a runny nose and maybe some light rls for a couple days ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

people keep talking about the eye test yet every defensive rating has russ up high .
idk how much i trust people 's eye test .
i would n't go as far as saying russ is the best defensive guard around but it 's also not silly to see how a defensive college guard can be playing good defense in the nba
it also looks very bad if you have another accident and need to use the insurance and can potentially void your policy if you have n't told them about this incident .

after a stressful day of work i love the game as it 's difficult enough to keep me paying attention but not too difficult to be a big problem to solve .
however they are still technically supposed to turn it in to the store fund that they will use for cookouts and stuff .
this is a fair middle ground in my opinion .
not the same as a store but the idea is that it would be unfair for the door man and the concierge desk to get all the tips while the people hauling trash and keeping the hvac system working to get nothing .
money goes into a fund and that is distributed .
now that i think about it casinos definitely operate this way and so do some restaurants in a way .

not an expert but my guess would be to somehow filter out the carbon from the smoke and not release the hot air outside as it would probably steam in the cold air and make a noticable mist .
maybe channel the smoke through a vat full of water so the carbon dissolves/goes in the water ?
however that would result in a toxic acid water that you would need to replace it after a while making sure to obviously neutralize with a base like baking soda before desposing it .
a better aproach would be to prepare before hand and get a specialized smokeless furnace/burner .
i 've heard propane and propane accessories emit less carbon than coal .

it teaches you patience and really lets you appreciate how hard money can be to come by .

the party system has never made much sense to me .
how can you group all your opinions into one large group and label them as one side or another ?
that entire way of thinking is what is best for the people ?
voting should be about the opinions that person has aligns with your own the most and has nothing to do with what side '' they are on .
they should be on the peoples side no matter what .
nope they just make taking apart your sks a bit more of a pain in the ass .
their 's a few other options that are a bit cheaper but ts-200 sites are the way to go with the sks zero'ed out to 200m they are accurate as hell .
scopes and rails just do n't work great on the sks .
it blows my mind that it widely accepted that one can spend 4 weeks and by the end of it learn everything they need to to teach someone to fly a freaking airplane any everything associated with it ... .
eh most of the points he 's trying to make do n't seem to be researched enough or explained well .
on his lacking originality point he 's mostly just talking about how aaa fps titles are riding the battle royale wave .
this was always par for the course and not surprising at all .
as you just pointed out being risk adverse is a main issue .
developers with annualized releases are typically the most risk adverse .
adhering to a strict time table to get a cod out every year even from three different developers does n't leave a lot of wiggle room for experimentation and innovation .
but it completely ignores the impressive leaps many single player story oriented games aaa games have made in the last few years of this generation .
his point on shareholders influence is a good one but this is kind of what i was referring to when i said it does n't seem well researched .
there is n't much info available on the influence shareholders have for each specific company .
yes we can see ea often bends to the will of their shareholders and ultimately the almighty dollar but this is also rather a easy shot to take .
maybe activision and ubisoft as well but even with whatever shareholder influence is held in those companies ubisoft has still managed to pump out some pretty good games along with finally giving the ac series a much needed overhaul .
finally the whole marketing thing another point that seems more anecdotal than researched .
most of these companies have a whole team of university graduates with advanced degrees is marketing .
if take-two is spending the money for a tv advert or radio commercial you can believe it was well thought out and not some snap decision .
as far as red dead 2 was concerned rockstar games typically break the boundary between hardcore and casual gamers .
the type of people who maybe only play one game a year or only buy the new madden and do n't bother keeping up with game news are the type of people who will break that pattern to buy the newest gta or red dead game .
so advertising on radio tv billboards ny subway stations etc is a great way to reach the people who are not hardcore about following game announcements or reading gaming news .
i do agree with some points of the article but they just do n't seem well thought out or researched .
more like personal anecdotal experiences rather than an unbiased critique of the game industry at large .
seems like it is an instant bend with vibrato in game .
i still do not have any clue how to read the bends real time .
if i want to get 100 i have to go look at the extracted tab .

your first sentence is a simple future sentence predicting that something will or will not happen .
your second sentence is about a possible but so far unreal present or future .
it 's possible to use 'would ' to talk about past habits too but it seems unlikely in your sentence .
my grandfather would take us to the sweet shop every saturday morning '' for example .
your example sentence is saying what would happen if you were in that situation and at the moment you are n't in that situation .
your third sentence uses 'would have ' which talks about an unreal past .
i would never have said that '' is saying not only that i did n't say it but also with the extra justification that it 's not my style anyway .

it 's the most neutral term we have for police sentencing a suspect to die without a trial and executing that sentence themselves .
it 's a loaded phrase and you know that .
you say it as if the officer took time to deliberate the facts reaching a conclusion of guilt determining the death penalty is appropriate and calmly killing the person .
you know damn well that 's not how it happens .
first that it happens in a split second and that it 's not an execution where there is no threat the the executioner but self-defense .
clearly you 're uneducated on the topic of which you are commenting .
the wa state blfa which spd uses has long included both crisis intervention training and de-escalation training .
so that when a guy has a knife it 's not necessarily a situation where the only possible response is shooting him ...
that 's not the situation now has not been the situation before and wo n't change with the new training .
you say it as if previously the only and necessarily outcome has been shooting the suspect .
if that was the case there 'd be a lot more dead people .
and they way you type out the shoot shoot again you are trying to make it seem like each shot was drawn out .
when in fact all the shots happened in less than two seconds after the officer told him to drop the knife three times .
tommy le was shot twice in the back in burien in 2017 .
first you stated cops killed a kid with a pen .
second you say he was shot twice in the back but leave out that he was shot a total of three times .
it is not surprising that he once shot would turn and subsequent shots would hit him in the back .
as it is likely that all the shots were fired in rapid succession the fact that two hit him in the back is immaterial .
police officers claimed he was approaching them with a knife which was in fact an ink pen .
police were responding to several 911 calls that a man with a knife had attacked someone with a knife .
the arrive on scene and tommy le is the accused and is holding something in his hand .
should they assume it is not the deadly weapon they 've been told he has or should they assume he might be a lethal threat ?
one homeowner even fired a round into the ground an inappropriate use of force to scare the man away but it did n't work .
and then he ignores officer instructions to drop the knife .
the officers attempted to use tasers but were unsuccessful and then a man reportedly with a knife continues to approach and they use lethal force .
you 'll have to find a different case if you want to argue that police will indiscriminately kill kids holding pens .
the question was n't why does every suspect the police encounter have to die it 's why does every altercation have to end in the death of the suspect .
there is n't a breakdown of the 11m arrests that involve an altercation but i think even you can realize that it 's far more than 987 .
so it is far from he case that every alteration ends in death .
when the police issue you a lawful command you must submit .
if you do n't they will proceed along the continuum of force and that may rise to a lethal force level and if lethal force is deployed you may die .
the other alternative is to stop enforcing the laws .
or only enforce them against those that agree to have it enforced against them .
and be sure to look up the continuum of force before replying .
because a cop can only be injured or killed if the suspect has a weapon ?
you should be aware that more people are killed each year with hands and fists than with guns .
and what about those times where the suspect takes actions to make the officer believe that they are armed ?
or the weapon they had turned out to be something else .
and more why do you have a problem with expecting suspects to respect the officer and comply with lawful orders ?
deven guilford flashed his brights two ... he failed to fully submit continuously asking the cop to justify ...
he refused to provide license registration proof of insurance as required by law .
you do n't get to argue with a cop on the side of the road .
if you feel the cop is out of line you take it to court and/or file a complaint with the department .
when the suspect refused to obey lawful orders the officer is charged with enforcing the law .
or are you again proposing the officer say you do n't want to comply ?
so sorry for inconveniencing you ignore the law go about your business.
refuse to provide docs they 're going to take you out of the car .
resist arrest you 're going to be tased or other force will be used .
the video shows him resisting arrest being tased getting up after being tased .
the article goes on to say the suspect pinned the officer to the ground and punched him 10 times .
the officer felt he was loosing consciousness which would have given the suspect access to his gun etc and fired to defend his life .
and again typing out shot him several times might make you think that each was a slow deliberate shot uncaring of the results .
but the rest of us know that in reality the officer was in fear of his life and fired until he felt the threat was over and they were rapid shots .
like the first five bullets did n't put the sassy seventeen year old down well enough ?
you describe a non-compliant male who is able to get up after being tased and pins an officer to the ground punching him 10 times as sassy ?
and again the officer fired until the threat was removed .
it said seven shots it did n't say anything about shot placement .
you 're on a rural route in the middle of the state in the snow .
two you do n't know if it is his car or not so you ca n't be sure that you 'll be able to track him down by the registration .
given the resisting arrest you do n't known since he was n't cuffed and likely was n't searched yet if he has a gun and will find a hiding place and start shooting .
all of this and the death could have been avoided if the suspect had provided his documents and complied with lawful orders .
the officer later claimed he thought the child might be a member of an anti-government terrorist group .
well that was n't in the article at all .
if you 're pulled over by the cops and they ask for license registration and insurance you give it to them .
it 's just so hard to read that as anything but a bully deciding to kill someone who disrespects them and then outright killing them .
that 's because a you do n't know what you 're talking about and b that 's how you want to read it .
hell i 'd like to give police the benefit of the doubt but then we find out police have carried around toy guns to plant on unarmed victims to justify them murdering them .
but even if we take it on face value it has multiple allegations .
someone who was already convicted made allegations that someone else said to do something but ca n't say if anyone ever did it .
though ward did n't say whether or not the tactic was ever used
a few bad cops in baltimore does n't mean that an officer in seattle improperly used lethal force in self defense .
look i have no problems with an officer shooting a suspect who draws on them
as in the case under discussion in this thread that 's exactly what happened based on what we know now .
you 're trying to say that an officer ca n't use lethal force to defend themselves against serious injury or death unless the officer has clear evidence that the suspect committed a crime that warrants the death penalty .
i hope you realize how rediculous that assertion is .
running from the police sure as shit is n't on that list and that appears to have been iosia faletogo 's fatal mistake here .
no his fatal mistake was pulling a gun on a cop .
how have we gotten this far and you do n't realize that ?
we 'll just have to see whether the police 's conduct passes the new litmus test .
if the facts as we know them hold and it does n't pass the new litmus test then you can expect every spd officer to quit or to simply sit in their cars all day while they look for a new job .
if and officer ca n't use lethal force when a suspect pulls a gun on them no one in their right mind would do the job .

i did it when i needed to listen again to a lecture to reinforce concepts .
sometimes i have my book open on the treadmill if i 'm just walking instead of running .
sometimes i stream it in my car on long drives and then re-listen and highlight take notes later .
would n't use it as the only way i get through a module but it 's helpful for reinforcement .
most single edged cutting swords are so you can slice instead of just hacking .
i will do some research on the 6.5 grendel .
my favorite bolt gun is a 6.5 creedmoor and it kills the hell out of everything but would require using the heavier ar-10 platform .
would there a noticeable drop off in performance with a shorter barrel either 14.5 or 16 inches ?
my biggest complaint was that they didnt commit to just leaving the 02 cast dead oh and even hinting at that awful season ending ...

just to let you know that we have solved a bug report that can occur if you are defeated in scenario 1 .
under certain circumstances one of your units can be duplicated if you restart the scenario .
this unit will not be visible when replaying the scenario but will cause a problem if you win and enter army management before starting scenario 2 .
we have a fix for this issue and we will roll it out as part of version 0.083 which we are hoping to implement over the weekend .
as a workaround if you lose scenario 1 exit to the main menu and start a new campaign to play it again as an alternative workaround ... ..do n't get defeated in scenario 1 !

he basically said you get in shape on the first few weeks of hiking
it has a steep learning curve with a high skill cap .
you really have to play it a lot and practice .
a lot of people play 50 or more games before they ever get to the final '' boss .
you should be able to beat the main game more consistently before you worry about doing the elevators they take tons of resources especially each floor and are hard to do unless you know what you 're doing .
also when you use them you start at that floor with only starter items so you 're at a disadvantage versus actually going through the floors .
do n't worry about elevators for now buy keys from shops when you can so you can open more chests kill bosses clear every room on every floor .
the syntax highlighter knows how to interpret python 's syntax and knows to expect python syntax simply because the file is a .py file .
so it starts parsing the file with an expectation that everything in it is a python language construct well a regular expression is actually an example of a domain specific language or dsl and it 's very definitely not python any more than json or xml would be and so when the syntax highlighter hits that it does n't see something it knows how to parse as anything but the python string literal it is so it gives up and moves on to the next token .
the nice re.verbose behavior happens to make the regex parser itself respect comments that happen to look like comments in python but they 're really comments in the regex dsl .
you 'll find that syntax highlighting is a bit of a weird art that does n't tend to work around language boundaries like this and a general programming language like python often has to embed bits of dsls like html and the highlighter can basically be instructed to correctly highlight either the python or the dsl but not both simultaneously .

he is really good at talking while playing well most of the time not as focused as cammy but a bit more entertaining .
i mean there is nothing that says that is inherently the outcome of promoting more cops mods .
though one could make a convincing argument based on previous events with subs like r libertarian .
however i would say that we do just a fine job of filtering it out ourselves .

modern dishwashers have a lot of sensors and logic so that it can adjust its program as it is cleaning your dishes .
so there is much less options on modern dishwashers .
however there are a few things it can let you chose .
the most costly part of washing dishes both economically and ecologically is heating the water .
but the colder the water the longer it takes for fat and other dirt to dissolve in the water .
so depending on the temperature of the water it takes longer or shorter to wash the dishes .
the last part of the washing cycle in modern dishwashers is the drying .
older dishwashers did not always have this and relied on humans to leave the dishes out to dry .
some modern dishwashers will give an indication that it is just drying the dishes and might even open the door so that the dishes dry faster .
in order to dry the dishes faster it also usually turns on the heating element .
when there is no water to heat it will heat the air turning any remaining droplets into steam .
so in eco mode it might not turn the heating element on as much and it takes longer to dry your dishes .
i do n't have any plans of making prints of this one currently maybe in the future .

hopefully instead it 'll give developers tools to cater for these audiences without having ti reinvent the wheel .
the app isnt popular but if it did come with accessible communication tools it 's likely it 'd become more useful inherently for everyone .

i put a shot into pershing then 2 shots into an at-7 across the map .
then the red heavies push into is-5 and lowe they both die without doing much and i end up sniping a bit from the middle dumping 2 clips into a red is-3d and a kv-5 along with a t28 proto .
game ends with a nub t-43 and sp1c rushing in against an is-3 d and a t28 proto as well as another nub su-101 that could have died but was one-shot .

i am happy to come to the house today to give my full support for this throne speech .
the ucp is ready to give the stability and security canada has been desperately hoping for ever since the former prime minister who began the long road of government instability resigned .
this throne speech lays out our plans for how we will go about bringing stability and security during our term .
we have a strong plan for foreign policy that will allow us to prosper in the new global economy and assert ourselves as a nation who is ready to defend it 's values on the world scale .
we are ready to work with our commonwealth european and nato partners to make deals that allow us all to prosper .
we also have a plan to defend the nation of canada from new threats emerging in our world .
from terrorists to hackers our government hopes to combat all threats to keep canadians safe and secure in a time where national security must be defended .
i am very proud of our governments plan too help the indigenous and francophone communities of canada to ever connect us in today 's age .
a canada that is connected and one that allows our minority groups to flourish is a stronger canada that can work together to tackle the issues that face us all .
our fight for freedoms and equality is a very good sight to look at with preserving the many freedoms we value such as freedom of speech and freedom to love who you want while also not bringing political correctness into the mix .
we are in great state in this area and our government hopes to preserve that .
this governments plan to lower taxes and balance our budget will help canadians on controlling their own economic future not the government wasting their money on vanity projects .
and with this budget balancing we will be putting money into programs that matter most and removing money from vanity projects .
the increase in infrastructure and technology spending will help better connect canada bringing us closer together and allowing us to prosper more .
we also have plans to put more money into the fight against climate change to hold our environment and keep canada clean and beautiful for generations to come .
it may be a fight and not an easy one at that .
but i am confident this government will be able to get things done and i am happy to be apart of it .
i am extremely pleased to support this throne speech and i am ready to work hard for northern ontario and canada .

ultimus crew could 've been expanded up more but i do like that their story is not over yet .
winter 's howl is amazing and the changes to the map layout keep the difficulty with anti-frustration features .
there are so many secrets and easter eggs steps need to be completed alone just to get things like pack a punch and the new zombie types are almost too much to handle .
you can have a werewolf s ! regular and crimson nosferatus special zombies and the regular ones in one round if you are unlucky .
it also sucks having to search the entire mansion for silver bullet parts shield parts and some challenges for the hidden rooms and stake knife can only be attempted once .
if you fail them you ca n't redo the steps to get them .
it 's not a bad map per say it 's just not casual friendly and the marketing for this map was just abysmal .
the order of it does n't do favors for the chaos storyline and tryarch needs to be more open with the community and not screw up the next map .
or the chaos storyline will not be engaging and the aether storyline will eclipse it .
if you have the budget railcar will custom cut you a pair of their ladies raws .

this post is in solidarity with u/materia_girl who was banned earlier today for posting this waffle pizza .
whether you respect this culinary creation or not if you 've been around r/food for long i think you can agree with the following
the only pleasure they take from their position is the modicum of power their allowed banning people left and right drunk with authority high on control .
the inability to engage them in conversation no matter how peacefully without being insulted they truly are miserable and i pray everyday for a better mod .
if you agree with this sentiment please upvote all the waffle pizzas you encounter .

i have had chronic daily headaches for 12 years now i was originally told it should n't last for more than 3-4 years but i guess that was wrong in my case .
i 've had years where it 's improved and it was far worse when i was pregnant as my headaches seem to be due to hormones .
i tried many medications and types of treatment when it all first started but was eventually put on gabapentin and stayed on that for years .
try to find out what your triggers are and what helps the most when they become unbearable and just keep going until you can find the right medication for you .
good luck my friend i know the pain you 're in unfortunately but it will improve one day .
wait getting the same players several games in a row has nothing to do with how populated the rank is .
the players in a comp lobby are all around the same rank and end their previous match at the same time .
if you immediately requeue of course you 're gon na get a bunch of the same people again .
if the matchmaker had some provision to prevent people from getting queued into lobbies with the same people from their previous queue times would definitely be longer .
evidence of low population would be getting the same people even with downtime between games or getting very unbalanced matches even during peak hours .
so is timo if he is silly enough to do that while levandowski is still there .
it could be true but unless you have proof to back up your way of thinking i am going to ask you not to question our posters specially if they are underage .
i think the game will run pretty well even on low end systems .
i assume that 2gd is using a machine with decent specs which results in a framerate constantly over 200 .
at the same time we have to bear in mind that it is also a pre-beta build assumingly with lots of room for performance optimizations .
those optimizations might only be applied some while after launch though .
there 's no way to build all projects in that solution from any single project file without making some kind of pseudo-solution.xproj file just to reference them all .
at which point you 're just being daft and should use a sln file .
i did n't get a letter stating they were n't paying .
i only found out after sending an email asking .
i then asked if it was possible to do what you suggested and the va said it would be falsifying the enrollment document .

yeah it really shows what he 's doing although we have n't created enough chances in the final third the tempo we hold on both sides of the ball as well as passing is pretty good this team as a whole is just so much more exciting to watch than mourinho 's wow .

there 's no reason for eren to want to help marley and he and zeke seem to be genuinely on the same side .
or at least zeke thinks they are and i 'm not sure what reason eren would have for betraying his brother when zeke is the one who seems to have brought forward a plan that would n't require paradis to sacrifice historia and her children .
i ca n't buy zeke having killed so many of the survey corps as a reason because eren has become a morally ambiguous character and has access to ... if not kruger 's memories then at least his father 's memories of kruger so he knows that people can do monstrous things to eldians for the purpose of eventually restoring eldia .
zeke 's worried thoughts about the full potential of the world 's armies vs paradis indicate that he is n't anti-paradis though i 'm not sure he 's pro-paradis so much as he 's probably pro-eldia and believes that the best thing for the future of eldians is for him to defend paradis here .

i only watched the first season but mostly the dad just yells at them iirc .
i hope it 's ok i stumbled in here .
the things my husband did for me that really really helped the most
i would get so wrapped up in taking care of baby i would often forget to take care of myself .
my husband would walk around the living room bouncing a baby on his sholder while i would take a quick shower .
another thing he would do as soon as he got home was bring me snacks and water .
i am personally just terrible at eating and drinking so i 'm not sure if this applies .
water is super important for breastfeeding to make sure mom can make milk .
a bowl of oatmeal every morning is what tons of women swear to help with their milk supply as well .
this might sound kind of weird but when baby is awake and not fussy both me and my husband try to play with baby to tire them out .
from bicycle kicks and arm wiggles as a newborn to tummy time and floor play as a 2-6 month old to lots of time in the jumper and practice walking standing form 6-12 month .
our kids have always slept like champs when we keep up with actively engaging them in some type of physical play .
possible down side is that our toddler is super strong .
like lifting gallons of milk and carrying them from the car to the kitchen and moving our heavy wooden kitchen table whenever he feels like it kind of strong .
kid is built like a tiny little line backer .
also as others have mentioned just a short break to
and i second the point of just talking to her .
everyone is different so the best advice would come from her personally .
now as for getting you through the night time feeds and the rough patches .
i would suggest giving a streaming service a go with one of the free trials .
i personally do n't have any so i did hulu one month and netflix the next down the line .
it is suprising how easy it is to doze off with a baby in your arms .
i have always been legit terrified of this thought .
watch a tv show or movie helped me stay just enough engaged to stay awake but not like so involved it was frustrating trying to do with a baby that suddenly hates everything .
a simple video game would also work for this purpose .
i am decently good at overwatch from all my late nights at this point .
it is really important to have someone to talk to outside of your spouse .
my husband has table top group that meets every sunday .
he told me at one point that it makes him feel normal after the day to day craziness that is having children .
also a neat thing that may or not help you .
when baby is being super fussy but dry fed burped etc .
sometimes just walking into a new room or going outside weather premiting can calm them down .
the show had an ending and tried to tie off some loose ends .
daniels cowrote the finale so maybe it was his way of admitting that leaving all the ends untied was kinda half baked

then just kind of spend a bit more on it to make you forget about the others .
i think his search for redemption makes him such an outstanding character his powers are to me just a bonus .
his role as antagonist and the realization of his actions makes him so human spoiler s which is so incredible since he was trying to become more than human '' .
and s even if his victims forgive him he ca n't forgive himself so he acknowledge that he will forever be a stranger to humanity that his past wo n't allow him to become normal and like everyone else he ca n't atone for his actions even if he tries to protect last order .
so instead he becomes a stranger and embrace his role as the other as a villain '' .
this makes his power so symbolic a barrier that shuts everything else out so he can live in his own tortured mentality .
paying lower taxes to get no medical care education support on crumbling infrastructure .
borders exist with or without a gold 20ft wall .
the border has been there for a while buddy .
others guys are offering higher taxes but with universal healthcare free college tuition and government programs to update dated infrastructure .
they are offering to use intelligent ways of enforcing the border with drones and cameras to minimize cost and upkeep .
and they support the right to defend yourself even with a gun .
sounds pretty reasonable when you boil it down like that .
especially considering that benefits all people and not just the wealthy or white .

if caldwell is such an issue tell me how joique bell reggie bush donald brown ameer abdullah bernard pierce and joseph addai did after he coached them .
go ahead go look up their stats during after caldwell .
go tell me how they all kill it on other teams but oh wait they did n't !
and fwiw i do n't believe caldwell is a good play caller never did .
however he 's only ever called plays 1 time since his hcing debut in indianapolis all the other times not so much .
also the passing offense regressed due to a loss of talent not because caldwell just forgot how to call plays between the sb and the next season .
they lost 200 targets between dennis pitta and anquan boldin who were the 1 3 targets on that 2012 team .
you know who picked up the slack for those 200 targets ?
marlon brown jacoby jones and 34 year old dallas clark .
pretty much like the lions going from marvin jones and tate to tj jones and whatever other guys we used during the 2nd half except extrapolate it over the course of a full season rather than the half season we dealt with .
not a total shock but having bad players in an offense will pretty much lead to having a bad offense .
outside of torrey smith they had pretty much an offense composed of bad players in 2013 and it 's not like torrey smith was a true wr1 he was just not awful .
and to think a new oc just carried out the old oc 's scheme for the remainder of 2012 is ridiculous .
if that was the case cameron never would 've been fired midseason .
it 's like saying when lombardi got fired that jbc just carried lombardi 's scheme since it was already established .
do n't try to put that over on me it 's literally flawed based on everything that happened before and after cameron 's firing .

why did n't they just long-press the power button ?
whether it 's ideate or autodesk for software expertise or it 's someone like contech or some concrete structure manufacturer they all have keen interests all the time in filling sales roles with technically competent people .
an alternate path i 'd suggest instead would be to get on the other side of private development working for a developer .
getting an mba in something finance or business related while starting a job on the development side would be a very strong start .

every time this is said i can only think to this post that defeats that stupid tee hee he made his job harder and killed people when he didnt need to '' bullshit .
because both of my parents are 100 polish and from poland .
i grew up with polish family many polish traditions.. polish food ... etc .
so because of my mix of culture tradition language and heritage i consider myself a polish-american .
when i travel abroad though i simply address myself as american .
i feel like calling myself polish-american would come off as kind of arrogant .
plus ... my passport says united states of america .
there are however americans that are 100 american in every way but because they had a great-great grandfather from germany or something they then consider themselves german-american which makes no sense to me as they have nothing in common with germans german culture language ... etc .
i am for all intents and purposes an american but because i still retain a lot of polish traits '' i personally consider myself this .
people who come straight from poland and become american citizens are most likely to call themselves polish rather than polish-american where as those born in the states with citizenship call themselves blank american .
i remember a kid from school who called herself russian all the time and russian-american but could n't speak more than 2 or 3 words in russian and was 100 to the tee american .
i do n't think even her parents spoke russian and only her mom came from polish heritage while her father was american .
you 're just plain old american with some russian genes .
so ... this is just my personal view on the matter .
for the most part it 's first-generation americans that call themselves blank american .
they often grow up in households that have traditions and languages of their family 's old home nation .
it is also a pride in their diversity and background .

i see a lot of people commenting that the hot springs are not actually hidden . ''
i would n't recommend going to a hidden one .
i once read something where a couple went off the trail in an area with hot springs and came across a hot spring .

nfl teams were only recently informed that this old rule would actually start to be enforced so how is it that he and his agent would have known ?
also an offer from the nfl is very different from an offer to be an nfl hc .
he probably considers like most coaches that nfl hc is the best job a football coach can get .
hmmmm that play was way too complicated just to get it to brown

i actually liked all of the dlc maps to be honest especially the ones for shock operations .
the biggest problem i had was that there was n't a way to have a full rotation of the maps you would bounce back and forth between 2 operations and it got boring after awhile .
i hated having to go back to the main menu to join another server for a different set of maps .
shock operations solved that problem since there was just one playlist with multiple maps .
but that problem could have been easily solved if they would allow full control of custom servers owners could just put the operation maps they wanted .
i do n't doubt that he has he is very respectful at least .
it 's more about how he makes the same mistakes getting angry/overly defensive over legit criticism repeatedly even if he apologizes each time .
he has been doing this since the sans is ness video and while he has shown improvement in taking criticism it 's something that he still has n't fixed about himself after these years and it 's something that genuinely affects his content
i just do n't think at the playoff level it would at all .
but the gap between one of the playoff teams and you guys is pretty big .
i used to go there for band camp every year in high school and marched during the halftime of a troy game one year .
i think there should be a way for teams like you to get there but the gap in talent is pretty significant and you would have to be on the hottest run in the history of your program to beat a quarter final then semi final then final over what would be the top programs in the country .

today it 's more about poor choices both federal and albertan made for generations leading up to this point and the current low price of oil than anything else .
so blame ottawa '' for everything is both simplistic and shirks responsibility .
it 's better to focus on how to prevent this situation from happening again than stoke separatism .

i think that 's in relation to the police immediately rushed to the scene because it seemed like a fairly lengthy delay .

the pixel 3 has a single rear facing camera .
all of the extra magic is done in software .
with some that nonsensical comment asserting sites will arbitrarily employ censorship because someone '' was upset in order to appease investors .
i ca n't find the article anymore but a few months ago while reading about the eu copyright directive this was a point being made during the debate .
it 's not something i pulled from my ass .
legal liabilities do impact how community guidelines are designed and enforced .
advertisers ' opinion of the content their ads are displayed with also have influence .
a website 's choice to allow adult content to allow sharing images to allow political content or allow psuedonyms or demand verification of identity etc all come down to their perception of how risky those things are .
i see sections titled causes of action '' where they tie the functioning of a website to legal language that might be relevant to product liability like defect in manufacture '' .
linking the two together is something the lawyer is creating it 's not like its set in stone ?
many of the points are fair i wo n't deny that .
but is it right to oversubscribe and bend a law like this ?
if product liability has never been applied to a website before and that 's the whole reason for the controversial nature of this case according to the experts then why should you expect me to find something showing that in fact product liability laws do neatly address issues related to websites ?
because you want someone else to read 71 pages of information about the case and summarize it for you in a manner that supports your beliefs .
the document you linked has 43 pages not 71 .
if you just say here you go here 's reference material '' instead of making a point that 's a douche move in an online discussion and i 'm inclined to think its you who did n't read .
right now there is a lot of backlash against social media .
some of it is very justified but a lot of things people act surprised over are things a reasonable adult could have anticipated .
maybe not this particular case but others could be far less justified .

mas sayang ang oras kung wala ka namang motivation at pagod ka na mag-aral meaning mas higher ang chances na babagsak ka so you still have to repeat subject/s which will cost time as well .
if i were you i 'd rather take even just 1 sem off to unwind to gather motivation to think and gather my thoughts .
and if i think i 'm ready then i 'll enroll in a course that i feel comfortable in .
honestly the ayokong mag-aral gusto ko lang ng diploma '' mindset really needs to stop .

grad school is n't only about marks in fact it 's generally a relatively small component at least in my experience in sciences .
you 'll probably get grades like this again but do n't sweat it .
many people do and all that matters is not to ruminate on it and to try harder or differently next time .

if you are so obsessed with a character being exactly the same color or sex as you are otherwise it will irreversibly damage your psyche forever ruining movies for you then that 's on you .
simple fact of the matter is you see what there is most of in movies .
in this country that is white people just like if you watched a bollywood movie that would be indians .
superheroes have historically been something that mainly males were interested in because it appeals to their masculinity and the inherent need to feel like a hero .
that is changing in this day and age with more females interested and it 's being shaped to add them in .
but if you have to factor in color or sex into whether or not you can admire a characters substance then that 's extremely shallow .

from a slightly different perspective i remember growing up and observing the kids who had one parent in and one out .
they were always edgier and we 're never as spiritual as the kids with both parents in .
and sooner or later usually when they became teenagers they all disappeared from the meetings .
when they become teenagers and want to have fun they always go to the parent who will let them .
i wonder what owls look like on their planet ?
when a president like trump erodes his own benefit to his allies enough eventually it starts to tip the scales and you may see the politics hit a new equilibrium where enough of those former allies do n't see it as in their interest to align with him anymore .
and politicians love keeping their jobs and having more colleagues in their caucus to network and make policy with .
the 2018 midterms showed them that this is probably not something trump is doing for them especially in increasingly-important suburban districts that swung to dems in 2018 .
what would they gain by standing up to him ?
well the earliest person to stand up gets remembered for having a backbone .
this could set off a wave of politicians wanting to become part of that group because they like their jobs and being known for having backbone can get you re-elected .
congressional republicans were there for him until suddenly they were n't .
often social systems that seem stable are actually only what social scientists call pseudo-stable and can change dramatically and unexpectedly despite seeming locked in a stable status quo .
this is what happened with the arab spring and lebanon 's civil wars .

is that his baby or has a woman supposedly joined this path of doom along side this disabled soddington disabled not as an insult but as a descriptor of what this man is not sure if that clarification was necessary but from what twitter scandals have taught me clarify even if it means you have to send two or more posts to get your message accross .
shit that was a tangent too good to be deleted for the betterment of getting my point across .
but anyway continuing from disabled soddington ca n't believe i found an excuse to use that term again oh goody for a lack of an emoji .
so my main question is what is the the origin of that mans facial expression who is also disabled but that should n't define him as a person .
not this again matilda i ca n't stand having to let the baby see me so powerless to fucking trolleys '' or is it why is this whore taking a picture of me '' the hostility probably stemming from an internal realization that that woman has indeed been fucked and he shall probably never engaged in such a pleasure at least not how he 'd like to .
i 'd like to point out how i did n't wish to 'severely ' offend any disabled people but comedy must prevail and some will fall victim i dream of a world where i do not need to make such calrifications but unlike that man many peoples disabilities lie in not that of the physical

you 'll get where you need to be and you 'll do it in your own way at the end of the day you 'll get better experience from being in your current unit than in theirs .
if you were annoying them i 'm sure they would tell you but it 's never a good idea to burn bridges that you may need to walk one day .
in short be happy for them do n't be jealous you 've got this you 'll do it in your own way .

it 's not next to the chatbox it 's in the chatbox .
... nitro gift button that is placed in the text box ... the button is located on the right side of the chat box next to the emoji button .
this https i.imgur.com/yr9tuos.png is how much room you have with the users tab open and the discord app window as small as you can make it .
i do n't know about you but i click towards the left/middle of the chat box .
if the gift box was such an issue then the emoji button should have been an issue too but you do n't see anyone complaining about it .
secondly to say that people are only mad about it because it 's change '' is just retarded ... and so on
i do n't know how long you 've been on this earth but i 've been here long enough and have used a lot of software to get into this mindset where little changes bother me .
it was a fairly significant change to the look feel and functionality of chrome .
after a week or two i got used to it and got over it .
however after some time people stopped caring and got used to it .
there is a big difference between changes that slightly modify app functionality and changes that break the app or make the app completely unusable .
you seem to be how i used to be when i had nothing else to do absolutely infuriated with everything and trying to take sides just to talk to people and spark debate .
it 's not necessarily wrong because it 's good to want to debate and have civil conversations with people but if you want to be respected and have a good conversation i suggest you take the rude sarcasm out of your messages .
if i lived in the 1600s i 'd be dead now so i 'll go with poor man living today .
you 're talking to a scammer not the woman in the picture .
the bos is not lore-breaking that 's a common misconception .
it was controversial to put them in the game i give you that but it is properly explained to fit the lore .
this is from someone who actually knows the lore .
i also think it 's partly to do with the fact that the person i am interested in at any given moment never seems as enthusiastic as i am about the possibility ... one of the things i hate most is giving my all and putting out a ton of energy/effort and not getting anything in return .
i also think it 's rare to find someone who can really see me for me .
i love the people who can appreciate my quirky positives qualities and who are n't afraid to call me out on my equally quirky negative ones .
soccer fans use soccer player name to by pass some of the filters .
breaking up a censored word in to different part is also popular .
i know this might seem like terrible taste but we could also move the comma to describe him at parties .
why are you getting this angry over a minor understandable misunderstanding ?
sometimes people will misunderstand you even when you might feel you were clear does n't mean they 're some disgusting failure of sapient life .

never tried it myself but flask of fire plus throwing blades can supposedly kill anything in about 3 seconds so maybe some sort of archer build based around that .
i love honchkrow i 'm planning on using a choice band/scarf set on the battle tree or on battle spot .
would love to see some more of your legs !
man it 's impressive how tall these phones are getting .
you just stomp on the brakes which i find stupid .
i generally love platformers in general and mario in praticular and even though the new auper mario series is getting a bit stale people say this game is the best in the series so maybe it will be worth it .
it kind of sucks knowing i 'm facilitating pricey ports but i do want to play the game .

that 's why you use trustworthy generic play store mirroring sites like apkmirror .
they do n't host just runescape in particular they host all app files on the play store unaltered .

no other markets in the centre unless i 'm mistaken .
did n't need a guild but could have and use one if you wanted .

i took notes but did not use them at all .
i think answering the questions as you go helps but there is just too much information for it to be a good study guide .
my ethic and quant notes were over 40 pages .
after you do some questions you should be able to pinpoint what you need to work on
i 'd say it 's more simple than that .
some people do n't like the particular changes that happened .
there was some small game mod or something i got into an argument with the dev a long while ago that seems relevant .
none of the other campaigns for game work like that for a reason .
it 's a dumb idea for the reasons i stated .
sometimes being unique just means you 're a screwup .
there 's no way those long parchments are holding her up .

that is true though are any babies being named it ?
maybe it should be in the uk section as it 's still way too old lady to catch on here i think in the same vein as the others listed .
i get a little frustrated with not getting any 4/5 units but when i think about it i have some good characters like diene ravi from rerolling for a week w. schuri husbando yufine .
what makes me happy is not by getting all 4/5 units but by seeing my favorite units growing upgrading their gears from low stats to abnormally high stats like 10k hp or 3k atk it 's like seeing your friend who was weak and now became a tough one by helping him/her out .
i think for your question about the motivation to play is me wanting to see my fav characters grow for enjoyment is probably farming catalyst .
yes catalysts ' drop rate are low but for me it 's worth the sweat i get lazy on the way but once i 've reached the amount to awaken/skill enhance i definetly get happy .
eh i quit playing after about 30 minutes and went back to oblivion due to skyrim feeling bland overly hand-holdy and the leveling system being dull and not fun to me .

rent yes as what we are getting out of it is the ability to pay off our mortgage faster .
they can stay literally forever as far as we are concerned .
i should point out that she is divorcing my cousin cuz he has made moronic choices and the kids are my god-kids and i have already once accepted the legal responsibility of caring for the kids as in both of their parent 's wills the kids will go to me if both parents are dead or unable to care for the children .
so needless to say the kids are my personal top priority here .
we were buying a house for ourselves and this divorce kinda sprung up and we found a house that was weirdly perfect to allow us to give the kids a home where their parents arent fighting all the time .
our main goal was to get a house for us as we do not like the restrictions we have renting right now .
that 's not actually an answer to the question .

ironically for me the low console price is n't an advantage but a disadvantage .
if consoles were priced as let 's say upscale smart phones so around 700-1000 but had better cpus which allowed 60 or more fps and maybe ssds they 'd become a serious alternative and i 'd consider abolishing my pc maybe .
i am playing from the couch on a oled tv already but play most games except a few ps4 exclusives on pc for fidelity reasons .

what kind of legitimate argument can the ref assoc use to back up those terrible calls ?
they need to cede to the people and acknowledge the greater problem .
i definitely come to this sub just to see posts like this ...
they are making 5/6 different variants of the gtx 1160 starting up a gtx lineup along with an etc lineup and basically multiplying the amount of cards they have by like 10 .
they are literally competing with themselves over the smallest changes .
meanwhile and got some big boy leaks for their new gpus and cpus thoughts ?
did n't realise the soup dragon was so racist .
fairy in bottle is a bad idea you ca n't slot it until it gets way cheaper 1 accessory you should get is a matyr leash .
then the 2nd one would be any of either str ring brooch rosary flower ring .
the important thing here is to buy accessories you can slot as you will need double kobold cards for both accessories .
going the fib way is pointless if your crit rate is way too low to matter .
a friend of mine that is a agi lk as well does lower dps than me when he already has fib and me with a brooch and a matyr leash but both have kobold cards .
same thing i suggest for other agi lk is to look for either a brooch str ring matyr leash flower ring or a rosary with atleast 5 damage total atleast 2.5 melee then 2.5 or higher from dmg increase or get an accessory with a flat melee damage 5 sharp blade 2
i 've yet to post or create a video for a guide on gear progression for agi lk but will do some editing soon to get it done .
agi is too high you can get aspd from other sources including upgrading your noble wristguards and foods .
you will also hit the aspd cap when you are in a party with a priest and use a grade agi food .
vit for me is useless i can tank and dps at the same time at 90f with 0 vit but its a matter of how you do it .
while you do get 1 atk per 1 vit you get more value from str for more damage you get 2 atk per 1 luk once you hit job breakthrough .
luk at your current level is okay but higher would be better when you get lv11 aura blade it provides 2 atk per 1 luk
gear progression is important for our class while the starter set is now cheap holy avenger is at 1.8m to 2m each
blueeve cape and beast heart is cheap as well .
i 'd want to see your full set including your adventurer book to see what would be the next best thing to focus your funds on .

infrastructure is not built overnight it requires years of work and billions of investments .
it 's not easy to do in a country that barely got out of extreme poverty .
agree but on the same note most western european countries have built most of their infrastructure in one or two decades hell even hitler built more than like 30 of german motorways .
since 2000 romania built only around 650kms and considering the distances between major cities and i 'm only talking about cities over 100,000 we would need at least 2000 more kms to connect them all .
hell i think bucharest and sofia are the only eu capitals that are not connected to the others via uninterrupted motorways .

i just do n't see how city can play with 2 offensive as fuck midfielders in david silva and kdb and we ca n't even play one offensive coutinho
it 's because of their winger 's workrate when it comes to tracking back and pressing .
our wings are usually dembele/messi/couts they do n't even come close to the work off the ball sane/sterling/mahrez/silva put in .
city 's first line of defence their front 3 is really good defensively meaning their second line of defence their midfield does n't have to be as defensive minded .
our first line of defence is pretty poor for a top club which means our midfield has to be more balanced to make up for our forwards ' lack of defensive workrate .
it 's a joke how little messi and dembele press/track back compared to wingers at other top clubs but they make up for it with their offensive output .
well that was towards your first reply were you changed what you said .
my point from the start was not that i specifically replied to you but that many people are claiming this about g2 due to 2 midlaners .
this looks more like a xenoblade chronicles than a breath of the wild though .
thinking about it i really wouldnt mind if we adopted koreas system of requiring your social security number to make an account .
it would limit botters and hackers and thus also limit nexon 's need for insane hack detection like we have now in gms .

personnally i watch a lot of video as tutorial and mechanic of the game to improve my knowledge of the game .
you can also analyse vid√©o of pro-player to analyse the move-set combos and how to go off-stage .

it 's very important to go on training mode to practice the combos of your character and to train to short hops and fast fall .
when you are able to do them easily try to do them online but it 's very difficult at start to make a combo on real condition .
do n't get discouraged and start training again and again .

love derrick and would say he is the best at the game out of the people on here but i think he played too good of a game on his first season to be able to win again .
people wo n't trust him and he 'll be targeted early .
someone like hayden who was loyal to the people he was loyal to and never really had to make any huge moves would have a better chance of winning again .

people seem to forget the hulk tore apart the hulkbuster suit on the first attempt and stark had to replace it by asking veronica to send another one .
yes hulk was thrown down the building but he actually got up but wanda 's spell wore off at that point and he was not in combat mode when he was knocked out .
and i do n't really think stark went toe to toe '' with thanos .
thanos was basically toying with him and caught off guard by starks ' different weapons but ended up just had a scratch on his face .
remember tony was wearing the same suit when he got his asses kicked by cull obsidian and would probably be knocked out if spider-man and later wong did not arrive in time to save him .
hulk was knocked out clean by thanos without the power stone being used but thanos at least considered it was worth his time to kick his butt for an exercise .
all that to say hulk was n't as weak as it seemed even in the mcu and the nano suit was not as powerful as it seemed .

try to clear every area completely using the teleport system .
this gives you more practice against each enemy and will give you way more loot and power scrolls .
try and get the runes as soon as you can .
when you explore each area you might come across a room with a big rock with a symbol on it .
there will be an elite enemy a much tougher version of a certain one and after you beat it you will get a rune .
the runes give you extra movement options like breaking walls and creating vines these open up more paths in each area and give you access to new areas .
edit not every elite room gives you a rune and they are each in different areas .
you can always look them up if you get stuck .
if you just want to get as far as possible you ca n't really go wrong with spending all power scrolls in tactics spend at least 1 on the other two for the hp bonus though and use turrets like the slicer/cross-o-matic .
you can use the turrets to take out the enemies for you from a safe spot .
learn to use door breaks roll into a door and down smash press down and the jump button in mid air .
these both stun the enemy and the down smash in particular does a lot of damage .
the game mainly comes down to trial and error learning the enemy patterns and getting enough scrolls and loot to make it past the tougher enemies .

fwiw just turn off the sound effects in settings until the drake is killed .
you do n't lose much characters are still audible and it allows you to fight the drakes without going insane .

money heist is great it was originally la casa de papel when there was only one season .
it 's not a netflix original everywhere they just have the us rights to it and are branding it as such .
it 's spanish about a team of strangers hired to take over spain 's mint holding hostages and printing money .
surprisingly well done where i expected full on cliche .
my only complaint is how they split the show into two seasons and how they edited the runtimes creating more episodes .
it probably would have flowed a bit better in its original formatting but with binge watching these days who notices .
also for a movie xoxo was entertaining and sweet with good music to boot .
fox news and breitbart just suck donalds dick all day never question his statements and never ever report on anything negative he does .

bolsonaro is a dangerous populist and how much better it would have been if the pt had won .
they were our choices at our second round of elections .
but i ca n't help feeling that both the right leaning and left leaning choices were not the best ones that could be picked on our first round .
amoedo would be a much saner choice to a right wing voter .
and there we get to my problem with bolsonaro .
my problem with bolsonaro is that what essentially differentiates him from the other right leaning candidates was his pro-dictatorship pro-violence speech that validates extremist behaviors among the population .
then we start treating politics like a choice between their favorite football team and not having a reasonable debates about problems that matter and if you do n't agree with this or that you are a communist/fascist .
so currently i do not believe that he will turn us back to a dictatorship .
even if that is a thing that he would actually very much enjoy seeing done .
that also seemed like a small number to me personally i think it 's about the principle of the thing .
congress and senate already agreed there already was a compromise .
if they let trump get away with extorting them or more precisely giving him exactly what he wants regardless of wether it has a majority in congress or senate is probably a bad idea .
it 's kinda the politic version of negotiating terms with kidnappers or terrorists .
you give him his wall what 's stopping him from asking for other things that have no majority in congress and senate ?
no exercise is going to be better for you than the exercise that you actually enjoy doing .
if you do n't love long cardio sessions do n't try to force yourself to do them that 's what 's going to kill your long-term motivation .

my personal choice is to run by myself in the mornings lift weights at home and then hike with just my husband .
if you have a lot of weight to lose once you 've lost a bit of it give those things you do n't enjoy another shot .
you might find you hate long cardio sessions less after you 've lost 30lbs and the strain on your joints is n't quite as rough .
or if confidence and insecurity played into why you did n't like x but you 're in a better place now give it a shot .

less well known is the paradox of tolerance unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance .
if we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant then the tolerant will be destroyed and tolerance with them .
‚Äî in this formulation i do not imply for instance that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion suppression would certainly be unwise .
but we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument but begin by denouncing all argument they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument because it is deceptive and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols .
we should therefore claim in the name of tolerance the right not to tolerate the intolerant .
i can think of a couple ideologies that answer arguments with violence in today 's society and it is n't the right or even the alt-right .
additionally i do n't think that the argument is meant to push any type of policy of suppression but rather to resolve the paradox itself .
the funny thing is that i did n't post this my wife did so i was very confused on what was going on .

democrats should actually show some political callousness and use it the way republicans would have if obama was in power ofc obama would never be this fucking stupid .
the yardstick should be is trump being fucked worse than obama was by republicans ?
if the answer is no you 're not doing a good enough job .
and before you call me an asshole for callously fucking up people 's lives to humble a braggart i 'll remind you again that trump created this crisis himself and can end it any time he can convince his ego to allow it .

when they think they 're better than someone their strategy is going to be to try and minimize variance and spend as little effort as possible to dispatch you .

i kept linking citations to articles at him and he kept on repeating himself .
he ended his tirade with a complaint about how all these federal workers are enjoying a paid vacation on his dime .
and on topic for this thread lack of air traffic control is going to affect air freight .

civics have been the most sold car in canada for like 30 years for a fucking reason .

but i 'm of the opinion that 2 motion shots are good for exactly that midrange looks off the bounce and off balance .
what they do n't do well is extend to 3 point range because the added distance means that the added motion is n't good .
and historically rui has n't been much of a 3 point shooter .
and yes i know ray allen was a two motion shooter .
but basically yeah i think most people are seeing part of that he has skill from midrange but his form is one that 's harder to expand to 3 and so he 'll probably never take those consistently at the nba level .
he 's got the puck on his stick which he can feel i think it would affect him far less than the goalie
i have n't seen the one on the right but they have a few games out massive darkness and decent are the two that your models most resemble .

ancaps are of course not really anarchists because they 're not opposed to hierarchy only the state i and even then many promote a privatized state and private police and prisons .
they 're not just not communist they 're fiercely anti-communist of the fascist variety .
they see fascism and state violence as a justified response to the perceived threat of communism which is why they idolize fascist dictators like pinochet .
many are also white nationalists making them naturally at home in the alt-right .

it is not our job to make decisions for our patients .
example i work in onc so a lot of my patients have multiple goals of care discussions .
the doc is the one responsible for laying it out of course but it 's always my job to help them debrief after because these are really tough decisions and a lot of information for them to process .
i always talk to the team before the discussion and try to be in the room as much as possible they 're often very long .
the providers have a tough job here they need to lay out all the potential treatment scenarios and what the outcomes are likely to be .
one of the biggest barriers that we have to end of life care stopping treatment when it 's going to cause harm and ultimately will only extend the patient 's life not cure is the rhetoric around cancer care is always fight fight fight .
sometimes fighting just is n't the answer but try telling that to a scared 28 year old and her mother who had no idea she even had cancer a year ago .
sometimes the patients have to go through hell multiple times before they realize that it 's time to transition to hospice care .
and 99 times out of 100 it 's for the sake of their loved ones that they continue pointless treatments .
my job is to walk into the room about 20 minutes after the team leaves and put on my empathy pants and listen .
i ca n't do a lot for them but i will never ever give my opinion on which option they should choose .
i am there to support and i take this very seriously .

i would get a phone call reject the customers unreasonable demand for whatever reason and they would then threaten to write a complaint .

they would drastically change the story into how they were a victim and the other person on the phone me was horrible and rude to them .
you understand that things like robots and space ships while called technology '' and not science '' are actually made using science right ?
like they are n't just slapping these things together from scrap metal and hoping for the best .
when people build a computer or in theory a space ship or whatever they are using scientific principles to make them .
the story does n't need to explain the scientific principles used to create the technology known as a hyperdrive for the hyperdrive to be science fiction .
there 's no known magic in the star wars universe other than the force '' and there 's no suggestion that the technology in that universe runs on the force '' so we have to assume it is just advanced science .
as for your argument about wheel of time the advanced technology from the age of legends is such a minor part of the story and the technology '' that we know of if they are n't explicitly explained as being ter'angreal it is heavily implied meaning they are basically powered by magic .
that is not the same thing at all you should look up the logical fallacy false equivalence '' to see why you are wrong .

it may be great to be considering a face lift for spring garden but it only takes a quick look at a map or aerial view to see this is a critical transportation corridor through the downtown with little alternatives .
limiting and at times closing argyle street makes sense as it has always been the entertainment district and was not any sort of necessary transportation corridor .
downtown does not have the classic grid systems of other cities nor service alleyways like vancouver .
we have a ginormous hill and national park in the midst of downtown the already severely limits transportation options in and out of the downtown .
a cycling network in halifax is probably a good thing but why choose an already congested street that regardless of what they decide will still need to be used by buses delivery vehicles taxis and the many who have no choice but to use spring garden because there are really no other options ?

something toxic should be in a resealable container and if it 's intended to be stored in the home then it should ideally be child-proof .
cans of paint always represent the color on the can so that you can tell what color the paint is .
one of the purposes of design is to anticipate how people will store and use the product and give them affordances to use it properly or avoid misusing it .
slapping a label on something that looks like something else and saying 'you 're on your own now ' is the definition of crappy design or at least lazy design .

you should have an amulet or cube-power that gives you immunity to your own main attack being reflected .
so that 's one element where the resistance is moot .
a firebird with immunity fire is superior to one without that immunity .
for some most builds i 'd use an amulet and a power for two immunities .
cold elements are mostly dangerous because of freeze/slow '' conditions .
there are various items that give immunity or reduce duration of control effects .
any high gr build should have one of those immunities .
enemies with posion damage are mostly nerfed that might change in future patches ...
lightning enemies are mostly weak there are a couple of dangerous ones .
simple question for the next 6 gameweeks going forward ... kane or salah ?
us police are trained to escalate because 1 they like to kick ass '' and 2 legally it gives them more latitude .
example cop knocks on your door and talks to you .
cop puts his foot in your door and you attempt to close the door because you 're done talking .
now things have escalated to assault of an officer '' .
this move is actually taught in most police academies which is why you as a citizen should not open your door when talking to the police .
he gets to barge in tazer or beat your ass whatever he 's in the mood for then handcuff you .
then for his safety '' he 's allowed to search the house .
so not only did he get what he wanted to search your house he also got to kick ass and gratify his inner violent bully .
see how all this looks much more attractive to the cop than a brief conversation and you closing the door ?

i think he was planning to splash him with the coffee after the dick guy recovers .
for classes with weird descriptions i would go to the class and observe without signing up big glass windows that you can see everything from for the classrooms ..
some of those classes like abs core or ones that sound like they 'll give you a good workout.. do n't give you that .
i 've been to some of the classes with names like that or ripped and there 's a lot of dancing around and weird footwork without using weights and you really do look like a broken puppet on a string when you are doing them .
like crouching down taking 6 steps forward and jumping and swooshing your arms like you 're shooting a basketball crouching back down backing up 6 steps and repeating for up to 15 minutes per class very useless ... that shit is ridiculous it did n't make me sweat nor anyone else that was in my line of sight during and after class and did nothing but make the arches of my feet sore for the rest of the day .
further it 's a little embarrassing especially when you do n't have foot coordination like me and you 're half a step behind i 've just up and left these classes and watched from the sidelines and the whole class was no different than watching and participating in those grandma workout routines that you used to put in a cassete player or dvd player not challenging not making you sweat nothing but embarrassing .
good classes are the yoga classes barre and barre fusion classes total body conditioning although i have n't been to this one for a while they might have changed the routine to something a little more ridiculous beginning boxing foam roll and release kettlebell training and boot camp .
honestly do n't take my word for it though instructors change and so do the routines even though when it changes dramatically they still call it by the same class name .
when in doubt go and observe a class even if it 's only for 10 minutes to see if it 's your style .
the instructors are generally really nice and you can talk to them after class and get tips or advice from them if you need it .
i 've always gone by myself to all of my classes that i schedule and it 's never been weird or anything .

also little girl did not want to cooperate at one of the 2nd trimester scans and the doctor said they were going to try to do everything they can to avoid having to do a transvaginal ultrasound and he looked so apologetic at the idea .
i just looked at him like dude shove the wand up there if you need to this an ivf baby and idgaf .
i mean i didnt curse but i did tell him she 's an ivf baby and i had like 20 transvaginal ultrasounds and i really would n't care .

when you ride an naked bike you sit more upright and it affects your posture making your back hurt and the wind pushes you back then you have the low saddle/seat height which can make your legs hurt after a while even if it say is a 90 degree angle .
the rear sets are not that much lower compared to a sportbike .
not sure about standards/nakeds but i disagree where this concerns adv bikes .
sitting upright is good posture and a windscreen takes most of the wind pressure off your torso and head .
not sure what you mean about low saddle/seat height '' a v-strom has 33.5 '' seat height .
and the pegs on the strom are significantly lower and more fwd so much so that it is really easy to go from a sitting position to standing on the pegs .
try that on a sport bike and you look like you are presenting '' .

a friend and i went to chicago pre-gps era .
going up there on friday we got lost and ended up taking 4 hours longer than it should have to get there .
on the way home on sunday we got caught in a blizzard that shut the highway down completely .
we were stranded at a truck stop for 6 hours .
by this time i was just done and wanted to get home .
it was 1:00 am and there were very few cars on the road .
i saw the cop on the median and immediately slowed down and pulled over before his lights and sirens turned on .
i sat there waiting for the inevitable ticket for reckless op .
after running my license he asked me where i was coming from chicago and looked at my home address .
he then asked you got caught in that blizzard in gary did n't you ? i told him yes and told him about getting lost on friday .
he handed me back my license and said this is an opportunity to be a better driver and do the right thing .
my friend and i sat there in confusion as the cop got back into his car and left without giving me an official warning or a ticket .
i should 've had my ass handed to me on a platter for how fast i was going .
but instead he understood my frustration and desire to get home .
i adhered perfectly to the speed limit the rest of the way home .

there 's been a few answers hear covering the emergence of human language here from a biology perspective it 's an open question when and how it developed .
the books are good recommendations so i 'm gon na focus on scripts instead .
every culture we 've documented used language spoken or signed but not all used writing systems .
it does n't seem to be a thing that just happens super naturally either since we have about three/four examples of writing emerging ancient near east in cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphics whose simplification and mutation eventually led to latin/greek/cyrillic/indic/hebrew/arabic/mongolian systems chinese oracle bone script which influenced most of the east asian writing systems and in south and meso-america .
in all cases they were originally quasi-pictorial individual characters mapped to an idea or image .
as you keep writing stuff though your gon na need more and more images so a lot of the ancient languages tended be logograthmic which is a symbol mental word in language mapping helped with phonetic extenders and markers to disambiguate context .
for instance ancient cuneiform is complicated to read with each symbol potentially having multiple semantic or sound meanings .
over time some of these scripts ended up simplifying and relying on phonetic mapping and spelling more and more which led to the more familiar alphabets abjads and abugidas of today .
alternatively logograthmic representation remained as in chinese and some other east asian scripts .
so why is it that there 's only been 3/4 real creations of language but there 's hundreds of scripts and written languages ?
well generally people would adopt them as needed if exposed to it as did the greeks with phonecian script and the ancient persians and elamites cuneiform adapting them to fit the meanings and sound systems of their languages .
additionally sometimes academics and scholars attempt to update develop or reform scripts to better fit the language as in old church slavonic modern chinese spelling reform korean hangul spanish royal academy ' regular suggested update to spelling which is a great part of how they work '' a few thousand years of practice some hard work and people generally adopting what works the most .
1 i do n't count scripts constructed by people already familiar with writing like tolkien 's elvish or canadian syllabic script to count as from scratch '' here .
i 'm so bad about using it daily even though i know it helps but it 's an absolute staple for me !
the point is for it to be excessive i 'd figure .

the abc is not culturally aligned with the greens '' that does n't make any sense .
i ca n't think of any situation where the greens have popped up in an abc story when it was n't relevant or newsworthy .
the most evident form of greens bias at the abc is the over-representation or greens focussed and greens favourable stories .
in other words the inflation of relevance offered to the greens exclusively on topics that are favourable to them .
if any subject which is a core issue of the greens is discussed the greens will be given equal coverage .
however when there is an issue which is challenging for the greens they are left out of the discussion .
the abc treats the greens like a third force in politics in a way that is completely inconsistent with their coverage of other minor parties .
other minor parties tend to be looked at as pieces to be played by the major parties the focus is on horse trading on parliamentary process etc .
they 're treated as a third force because they are a third force .
the greens on the other hand receive coverage about policy positions and announcements .
despite the fact these are meaningless coming from a minor party .
labor and liberal both get coverage about policy positions and announcements .
greens do too because they 're the third biggest party and their positions on issues are relevant .
even if you do n't believe they 're newsworthy in of themselves they 're relevant as other political parties manoeuvre themselves in reaction to them .
particularly with labor who are currently in a locked battle with them over the left .
that breath of the wild is n't really in any of the legend of zelda timelines but the one that they all convulse back to explaining why it references histories of multiple games in different timelines although i have considered it could be a restart circumstance aka before the orginal timeline but that is more a part of the same theory
but a mortgage stays as a lien to the property so it has to be paid off or assumed in order for the property to be sold or transferred .
or else the mortgage lender is going to foreclose on it .
also any assets that are part of you estate must be used to pay off your debts before your estate can be distributed to your heirs .
your best bet is to sit down with an estate planning lawyer who can advise you how to set up your assets will and maybe a trust so your heirs get the maximum benefit you 'd like them to .

fixed a bug where corrupting tier 15 shaped maps could result in a lower tier map .

i moved back in with my mom at the age of 34 after my divorce destroyed my life savings .
it was incredibly helpful at the time to have a place to reset .
once i was back on my feet though i could n't get out fast enough .
after that it was the first time i had lived alone in my life which was an invaluable self-learning experience .
imo that 's what you should be looking forward to eventually .
everyone should live alone at some point in their life it 's very freeing .
it 's your place and nobody can fuck with it except for you .
but really you do n't have to rush it if you have a good thing going now .
lol same with abyss except you get to see when the enemy is gon na use their ultimate example mushrooms and mercedes
4g speeds are generally in the neighborhood of dsl say 5-15 mbps .
5g speeds are expected to range anywhere from 500 mbps 1.5 gpbs .
the extra speed may not be crazy useful for the things you are currently doing with your phone because you are already capable of doing those things with your current speeds .
the extra speed opens up a whole new realm of possible things you can do which your current 4g phone simply ca n't .
the first one of those things for many people may well be to ditch their current home internet .
who needs to deal with comcast for home tv and internet when you can get a 5g device that will allow everyone in the family to stream 4k video at once ?
a jump in capability like this does n't just make things faster it makes whole new things possible .
why post such a low quality play and be disrespectful oh wait you 're probably in iron and dont know how to not be toxic never mind !
i 'll ask again what is your theory here ?
that multiple state dmv agencies are slow rolling just tesla titles ?
i wonder if these parents get their children to act out these scenarios .
you can setup a custom dfs game on draft kings just for you and your friends .
more satisfying than microwaving them that 's for sure .
better yet you will put the flame out on a molotov and put it away !
when i say spawn it in i mean just download builders workshop map and grab it on your character .
college football in the us is broken into 5 major conferences power 5 and a bunch of smaller schools in a bunch of conferences .
they each have their own individual network deals by conference but espn is going to have the most individual games because the networks for 3 of the power 5 acc sec pac 12 are espn owned .
i 'm not sure how those deals work out though internationally though .
in the us we have watch espn which comes with most cable subscriptions it allows you to watch anything on an espn network or on abc .
just had a look at the output of the hdr10 release with madvr converting to sdr .
as expected the black levels remain the same regardless of settings clipped at 100nits using the tone mapping curve etc .
so it 's not a tv setting or the tvs tone mapping curve .
lol ive tried to draw her a few times it never comes out right
yeah i was more aware of that than him doing poi actually but it shows that he 's hit the ground running with it .

well if you are into manga it 's a pretty recommendable series .
it 's been one of the darlings of r/manga for a long time now and it 's close to finishing if the author stops having random hiatuses

actually i 'm gon na f my way back in h because it was a joke and i am a closet laker fan .
for those wondering the relevant type of scam a triangle scam is addressed in this post by r/leesalt https old.reddit.com/r/mtgfinance/comments/adj8u9/is_this_a_scam_someone_selling_sealed_allegiance/edhw4x3
the seller takes your money and many times will send you the actual product so you 're happy and they get good feedback .
what happens is they use stolen credit cards to purchase the items they send you but they ship the item directly to you through an online shop like tcgplayer or cfb scg etc for full price .
so then the credit card gets reported as stolen the cc company takes their money from the company that originally has the item .
then the only recourse the company has is based on two addresses your address and the address of the person whose cc was stolen .
it 's doubtful they pursue either since one was a victim of crime and another was the unassuming purchaser of stolen goods .
in general this scam usually only hurts the company that sells the original product but it 's not something i want to be involved in because it 's just a shitty thing to do .
edit also you 're dealing with known human scum so there 's no guarantee you 'll even get the stolen goods sent to you .
the cc may be caught before it 's sent or any other number of things .
unfortunately your submission appears to mirror a common thought .
please remember that as per rule 1 all showerthoughts must be original and unique .
ci sono un sacco di canzoni italiane in cui mi piacciono la ritmica e l'intonazione ma la maggior parte dei testi parlano di cose romantiche che purtroppo non mi riguardano perch√© sono da sempre single ascoltare canzoni di questo tipo mi fa sentire ancora pi√π solo e diverso dagli altri che riescono facilmente a trovare una donna .
ci sono autori che compongono testi in cui parlano di cose come la solitudine e il non riuscire a trovare la dolce met√† ?
well i do n't i do n't want to be told how to combat something .
oh sorry to hear fighting games are not for you .

if you have to ask you are too young to know .
only a few months ago prevailing opinions on this subreddit were all for sophisticated content that catered to the hardcore and dedicated .
obscure puzzles that motivated the community to solve together .
now that we have it people want the opposite straightforward content that 's accessible to everyone .
the very design philosophy people criticised vanilla d2 for .
i guess the idea of difficult and exclusive content is more attractive than the reality of being one of the people excluded from it .
looks to good to ruin with edited text from paint though
that 's more of the ignition cylinder than the key rhough right ?
are n't you supposed to do drugs at joshua tree
what you think he turned out the opioid vote ?
more like he campaigned on doing something about the problem .
he turned out counties who have to deal with opioid users .
i found it interesting he also turned out rural areas where a large percentage of young people had deployed overseas in active combat .
damaged and dead youth made his message of isolationism attractive .
actually with kiames in-game def editor you can fix many of those things yourself .
though only for the actual traits not for the preferences added with psychology .
you do n't even have to know how to mod apart from understanding the different datasets and how to trim them to your liking .

personally i would have the villain dispose of the heroes in one way or another .

the wc3 remaster is a joke haha it 's like they do n't wan na spend for r d .
what i meant is even if you announced your target to your group most of them will just ignore it anyways .
there 's no point pressing the button if no one actually cares .
i did n't read any of the other comments before posting this so maybe it 's just my area but where i 'm at we have a ton of drug use i think at one point we were in the top percentage of overdoses per capita .
around here if you 're a felon but making an effort to change yourself then you 're gladly accepted .
i had a lot of recovering addicts in my basic classes but even those you knew who had been to prison or were addicts they were welcomed with open arms and even received more support from their peers .
i 'm not sure how it is elsewhere but i genuinely hope people accept you for who you are now .
i do n't have any tips on subjects to go into but i have tips on what helped me through college !
it 's been proven that writing in colors other than black/blue help you retain information .
i would switch colors when the topic changed and highlight any important information within those .
for math it helps when you 're doing different steps of an equation or different parts of a problem .
since i chose to write in pen it sometimes bled through so as wasteful as it is i only wrote on one side of the paper .
i found it easier to read and study when i went back to it .
or they were mine at least i personally liked to keep a 1-1.5 binder for each class a different color for each back to colors lol that way you ca n't confuse them .
there were a couple of times when i grabbed the wrong binder for the wrong class .
it 's always good to know at least one person in a class in case you have to miss or need help with an assignment
i am such a huge procrastinator and i regretted it every .
so just try your best to work on stuff even if it 's only a little bit at a time .
of course it wo n't be easy but you can do it !
and as you go you 'll find what works best for you those are just worked for me .
so good luck on your journey i wish you nothing but luck ! !
the best way seems to be jumping or hiding behind cover .
while driving with my windows down i 'm going to go over a snake and it 's going to flap somehow and land on me .
i will not dye in he car crash cuz my gear is going to explode before that .
we even have the terrible traffic on certain times of the day !
then build on from there to someone in real life
below you will find a very small part from chapter 4 given from both translations in order to compare

positively as it has has gifted me with almost all optc knowledge i possess as of this day .
also negatively as the fanboys really hoard on games like this bending their whole life over .
and then when normal players suffer from this as they have a real life to govern they get bashed by the bendovers .
the norm is life optc and i really feel bad for the general gaming community .
because god forbid if you as a player would have any input or opinion on your gaming experience at all .
just pay with all of your wallet stfu or get the fuck out the game if it does n't suit you..
the number one threat to the gaming industry imo .
also the rates progress and time invested are constantly getting relatively lowered .

the existence is superdelegates '' is the most legal and most obvious form of cheating employed .
the dnc appoints some individuals in each state to act as delegates directly who get to cast their vote regardless of how rank and file voters vote in a state primary or caucus .
their vote counts tens of thousands of times as much as other people and their only qualification is the party appointed them to that position '' .
some sanders supporters are sore that the media reports their declared intentions for how they 're going to vote early like when the primaries get started or when their own states vote instead of at the convention at the culmination of the process .
but imo the real problem is there are superdelegates '' at all .
defenders of the dnc will argue that the superdelegates have never determined the final outcome of an election .
they argue this in the process usually of defending the existence and necessity of keeping superdelegates around just in case . ''
the fact that you just compared the private sale of national parks to calls for gun control after a school shooting is ... worrying .
vertcal lines on film are scratches on the surface of a film print .
this can be due to the print running over some dirt a stuck roller or any stationary object in the film path .
for this reason areas handling film are usually well-maintained and very clean .
on film stock there is an 'emulsion ' side where the image is printed and heavy scratches can look green as most of the emulsion is scratched off the film .
if the scratch is lighter it will appear black instead .
source i was a film projectionist and accidentally caused a few scratches in my time .

but do n't get disappointed by the dislikes just keep uploading good content .

i used this explains pretty well where and how to get each decoration .
the dolls above the tool table are from akihabara 's arcade .
they are obtainable through the crane game make sure to get them before the prize rotates .
well when it comes to lr vb it 's an lr i would n't necessarily expect an eza unit to hit harder even if he 's belgian .
he is the best f2p unit as a whole thus meaning that standards of good for f2p '' or bad for p2p '' kinda get thrown out the window .
of course it 's possible for an eza unit to hit harder heck just look at teq cell janemba beerus all hit disgustingly hard but with the damage predictions maybe gogeta 'll do just that .
teq vb does hit extremely hard at the end but i only have free dupe for him so i guess i 'll never really know until i pull more he 's one of those units where if you 're lucky he 's the best unit in the game if you 're unlucky he 's a defensive liability due to the fact he could n't kill the enemy in one go and has a slow overall atk and def raise via his sa .
and i never run teq vb on sbr he 'll never have the defense he 'll never get to hit hard .
it 's why i 'm excited for this gogeta eza any eza that gives itself a defensive boost tanks disgustingly .
it 'd also be a great way to speed up holland 's development into the ideal '' spiderman getting inspired by the best traits of all the other spideys he meets .
it seems like a lot of creatives toil away in their twenties and thirties maybe even half of their forties before they start to actually matter . ''
by that metric a guy with 14 years of experience and three years shy of forty might still be considered young . ''
somebody who 's only just climbing out of the grunt work .
probably do some research to how everyone else is fucking shit up and write it down .
then fire them in ways they 'll never get a job in politics again .
please tell me you 're not a guy . ''
homophobic moron praying he has n't come across a gay man .
you can try adding your switch to your router 's dmz to test if there is anything you can do .
if that does n't improve your nat type you 'll need to contact your isp for possible options or change your isp .
if setting your switch to dmz improves things you can either leave it there or remove it from it and create some port forwarding rules .
if a device is in dmz the device is n't protected by any possible security features of that router .
in most cases there not small droplets of water in the air but water as a gas not a liquid .
you only droplets in the air when the relative humidity reaches 100 by for example cooling of the air .
these people can pretend to be other people better than you .
so they are better than you and their opinions are to be trusted .
we figured that we have been applying early and the real hiring season will be in march/april .
i will contact the gtcs as soon as i can as i 'm going through re-certification in the us right now .
when you say in a job you mean already in the field ?
we were thinking that as an american i could finally gain a leg up on the competition for hiring as previously eu nationals were the demand and americans were not regarded in the slightest for jobs in the eu priority to eu nationals of course .
we do n't know what will unfold but we are staying positive in trying to accomplish what we want for our future family .
to speed that up just walk a red light in front of children and old ladies .
yeah master technician should move it from 1 to 2 .
maybe there 's a cyclops with a battle computer in the opfor ?
so youre talking about laws of a country yet you just said you should ignore the law because freedom of movement is a basic right ''
you cant just pick and choose laws lmao if i have freedom of movement then i have every right to go into your house or property
si on mettait les 7 milliards d'habitants de la terre dans une m√©galopole horrible et pollu√©e qui couvre toute la surface de madagascar on verrait un monde d√©primant et l'√©cosyst√®me irait pourtant dr√¥lement mieux .

you will have to convert the iso file into a. imgptn file which lets you boot the image in either legacy or uefi .
1809 and maybe other versions have problems with fat due to single files in the iso beeing over 4gb .
there is a workaround for it but i have not tried it myself .
you can also reduce the image size with something like ntlite by removing unnecessary windows versions from the image like workstatiom n and so on

she requested the flag fly in honor of all transgender texans either on max 's birthday or on tuesday the first day of the 2019 legislative session .
if i 'm correct einstein had a similar view .
here 's the deal stop the spamming of trans stuff and continue with the northern ireland related stuff .
there are other more appropriate subs to discuss that topic and if you 're struggling with your lifestyle there are professional services out there you keep linking to them .
yeah hopefully will get one started in the next couple of weeks .

there 's also a big pedantic speech in the beginning but i hope it is n't that boring
1 asthma bronchitis and depression are fixable of course in some cases only partially by either therapy or medicational treatment in a serious case of asthma you have an inhaler which is a temporary solution in case of emergency so that 's the disease i always compare depression to it 's just there and you ca n't really do anything about it if it 's serious but take a hit of your prescription when you ca n't even breathe or function normally anymore .
it helps a bit but you still wo n't feel so good if you do n't have a recreation plan and there are a lot of different kinds of medication and things you can rely on for depression .
there 's a lot of i-tried-this-and-it-fucking-made-shit-worse but if you can get something right for you it will help a lot
2 that 's exactly why i did n't say if you want to live '' but if you feel like you should want to live '' .
of course nobody wants to live with depression both as in live enduring depression '' and i do n't want to live anymore '' .
from my experience there were many occasions when i did n't want to live like this anymore '' but i always tried to rely on a thought that everyone somehow lives fine and dandy no one around me wants to die so what 's so different about me ?
like i should want to live but somehow i do n't .
like i am somehow broken or have n't been taught what it means to want '' in my childhood .
but if everyone else has some reason behind their existence so should i .
and the fact that i ca n't put my finger on it right now does n't excuse my lack of motivation to live .
if i still do n't want to live maybe i 'm doing something wrong ?
like maybe i have n't told anyone that i 've been spiralling down for more than a year and i feel worse each day ?
when people around you know your condition they can learn what to or find someone who knows what to do .
so there is a line between i want to die '' and my depression wants me to die '' .
maybe my past experience with depression can help you a bit
what helped me were actually my friends and a passion .
once again i do n't know what is your case and what life are you living but for me it was the last year of school and i had a couple of friends i thought i could rely on and i told them about my depression .
so they started trying not to ask dumb questions like why are you sad ? ''
and such and actually tried to help me suggest new hobbies take me out of the house on trips and such get me to do more school-related stuff with them rather than on my own .
they are still my friends now that we go to different universities and they 're the only people i talk to so their presence is life-changing literally .
i also picked up my father 's guitar learned how to play it and started writing songs so now when i 'm feeling shitty i just try to write what i think in notes on my phone and drop some sick chords on them or maybe just sing something i wrote before .
i picked up ableton an app to edit music and started making fully fledged songs and putting them up on the internet .
of course i 'm not famous and there are like 10 people listening to my songs but knowing that my thoughts are out there in the world makes me feel better .
and i can cry my ass off while singing some of my favourite songs that i actually wrote .
if you have someone to open up to just do it .
you wo n't do better if you sit on your ass and do n't do anything about it .
but if you tell somebody that you are not fine then you just might find something that can make you feel at least okay for the moment .
you want to die anyways what can make things worse ?
for anyone around you it 's better to know that you 're depressed than finding out that you killed yourself because you eventually snapped .
i just hope you do what 's best for you .
your life is the only thing that matters and realising it is the most important thing you can do .
i 've occasionally experienced big delays but it mostly gets me where i need to go on time .
there are many improvements that could be made but a lot of stuff is currently actually in the works green line extension new cars for the orange and red lines new fare system .
they 've just recently started putting bus lanes in some places which makes an incredible difference they need to be rolled out all over the city .
i hear the red line is really unreliable but i do n't take it so could n't say .
one major gripe i have is that bus stops and a number of green line stations for that matter are far too close together .

wwe can barely get their stars on these shows and when they do they go guns blazing with cena and he 's not even usually the first guest .
once in a great while you 'll get someone lower level miz and sheamus have been on the cone zone in the past so if wwe struggles to promote their talent on these shows and roh and tna have never had anyone on late night what the fuck makes you think some brand new promotion is going to be on there ?

probably like these more though https www.massdrop.com/buy/tai-hao-paradise-pbt-backlit-keycap-set https www.massdrop.com/buy/tai-hao-paradise-pbt-backlit-keycap-set .
it 's a color variation of the miami set and it has backlit keycaps .

vega20 was n't designed to be a gaming gpu but ofc it can do gaming too .
now that amd saw the turning perf and realized they could sell vega20 for 699 to gamers too ofc they will use fancy words .
it factually is the first 7nm gpu you can game on .
does n't mean it 's a particular good one tho
do i make my eminor my home chord '' and even make it more present compared to other chords ?
and you need one other chord that has an f in it .
well you 'd need the d to be dm .
and there 's maybe one too many chords there .
or you could use f instead of dm as the more common bii phrygian chord .
i.e. you really have to be able to hear e as home '' and that f e move is the phrygian cadence '' .
you might be able to get other chords in there but there 's a risk of drawing the ear away from the e centre if you move away from em for too long or too often .

coba sunset includes the zip line actually they built it .
a private company has agreements with the zip line company too but i 'm 90 sure you can pay over there if you want it and it wo n't cost more than 150 pesos .
the cenote wo n't cost more than 200 could be 50 80 100 120 pendes of which one you choose
it 's probably more a problem of the top of the sls not being designed to withstand the aerodynamic forces of flying without a fairing since falcon heavy wo n't cover the whole thing .

these two were how i diagnosed myself which later saved my life as i had to be immediately operated the hour after my ultrasound results came in .

tbf a big part of the reason he got off was because it turned out the cop that found the glove just happened to be a liar and a racist .
when they proved he lied on the stand about being a racist it was very hard for the jury to not think the glove might have been put there by him .
on top of that another cop took the murder weapon as a trophy it was only recovered a couple years ago .
to be clear i definitely think he did and he has since basically admitted it but it was n't just a wonky legal system that got him off but also inept and tainted police work .
ok you can download the file again just put the splashart inside the champion folder

i read manga because i do n't like having to read in videos subtitles .
manga i can advance as fast as i can read it whereas anime i have to sit around while they continue jabbering in moonspeak after i 've already finished reading the subtitle and it makes it hard to play a game at the same time which is what i 'm usually doing when i 'm watching tv or movies
that i get to use that as an excuse to dissociate from weebs is a bonus
in the metal gear series one of the protagonists/antagonists depending on which game youre playing creates the msf militaries sans frontiers a play on medecins sans frontiers aka doctors without borders so in this case soldiers without borders .
its a military without a country basically in this universe a private military corporation mercs .
they recruit from battlefields all across the country finding soldiers who feel disenfranchised by countries treating them like pawns but still have no place in the world besides war .
one iteration of this group is called diamond dogs basically just because the creator of the series hideo kojima loves david bowie and makes references to him constantly .

that 's the same logic why everyone started making mmos but wow having millions of users did n't mean there was a massive market for mmos it meant there was a massive market for wow .
to be fair to your media said multinationals have been baring one or two exceptions here and there very quiet on the subject it seems they fear accusations of meddling in politics project fear '' talking down the country '' and all that .

wah ea does n't fix anything ea is garbage as usual .
this is the most they have cared about nhl in a looooooong time so that 's not true and the pause glitch is fixed probably just your trash connection .

yeah i noticed the muti screens after i looked at it but opened 5 windows and it was a laggy mess .
plus do n't make windows smaller as you ca n't make them bigger again or at least its very hard i could n't do it .
i 've had great sushi and would love to go to japan and have some real sushi from a real sushi chef ... then there 's the stuff from the plastic container in the supermarket ...
i did the uofw film course all the way through .
vfs and toronto film i hear are decent but quite expensive .
you 're going to get various advice depending on who you ask and a lot of the advice will clash so decide what 's best for ya .
more suitable if you 're the type that learns better in a classroom setting .
the information is more narrowed down for you instead of just blindly searching the internet not knowing where the hell to start .
you 're going to be surrounded by like minded people who you can then share your talents with to make stuff as a collective .
i 've also gotten paid union set work because someone i befriended from school asked me to hop on .
uofw tuition fees are cheaper than like all the other options afaik .
some film profs there howard curle shereen jerrett bruce claydon specifically are really good to learn from for different reasons .
film is a bit secondary for the theatre and film dept emphasis on and film '' .
it 's a very theatre-centric dept and we definitely felt a bit like we got the shorter end of the stick in terms of how much resources and post graduate stuff are available to us .
to add on to the point above once you graduate you 're kind of on your own .
if you did n't make the connections it 's gon na be an uphill battle to get anything going .
since uofw is n't a film school you are required to take lots of other class requirements to graduate .
as for your focus on editing and camera work editing 's tougher as there 's less of a demand for them and less room for them .
camera work though there 's a film training manitoba program you could take and look into that 'll get you on to that path .
since they ca n't put faces i espect it to be the normal suit with italian spiderman suit and wig obv on it

this looks like a picture from a sneak peak .
i have n't gotten used yet to the fact that this is now live gameplay .
it sucks having to jump through the prescription hoops every month .
it especially sucks with add scripts ‚Äî phoning insurance getting to appointments and dealing with all sorts of red tape exactly the sort of shit i ca n't do when i do n't have my meds !
however you ought to consider adjusting your attitude towards pharmacists .
they are n't pill counters they are highly qualified professionals who have completed years of post-grad schooling .
pharmacists are n't able to deny prescriptions on a whim ‚Äî they are tasked by law and ethically with ensuring that their patients receive the correct choice of treatment .
in fact they share responsibility with the prescribing md ‚Äî if your md prescribes the wrong thing and your pharmacist does n't catch it ?
they 're equally liable for whatever harm you may suffer .
your pharmacist is the person who makes sure you do n't suffer an allergic reaction .
they 're the person who makes sure you do n't accidentally take too much of a drug when multiple doctors write you the same script .
they make sure that your various prescriptions wo n't counteract each other .
and it 's worth putting up with the occasional delay .
i imagine quin ripped them all a new asshole during halftime .
the first half vs second half was night and day different .
i say this a lot but it 's very important to realize that there is a difference between a fetish and a sexual orientation .
to call a sexual orientation a fetish would be to greatly devalue it .
in fact a lot of closed minded people make the argument that homosexuality is just a fetish that you can pick up and i find that pretty disrespectful .
a fetish is something that turns you on and a sexual orientation is determined by what gender s of mate you seek .
if you get hard looking at femboy fox pictures but still desire a female as a mate rather than a male you are straight .
some people might see furry porn and correctly realize they are gay .
other people might see furry porn and think they are gay when in truth they only acquired a fetish and they will eventually realize their misconception once they start dating .
the parties steamrolling come out in droves when this gamemode is out .
camping in north carolina one night on my own land .
i routeanly pack a rifle for self protection and this trip i brought my ar15 with one 30 round mag .
i have always been a little over kill lol .
had no plans to use it save a bit of target practice .
well about 2 in the morning i wake up to these strange melodic owl sounds coming from three moving lights past me .
i could hear the cruntch of boots in the soil and see their headlamps moving .
had a tough time going back to sleep and i did n't know if they had seen my tent .
about an hour later they came back making the same strange noise .
this time they got closer and surrounded my tent .
so in one move i stepped from my tent with rifle and light in hand charging a round again shouting .
as i moved their lights went off and i saw nor heard anyone .
i stood guard outside for 1 hour and i hurt faint sounds of the men moving off .
i went back in the morning and found one footprint .
i was n't dreaming and i had a fellow camper with me who also woke up .
to this day it creeps me the fuck out thinking about it .
my life is strange enough as it is i do n't need to make things up to help .
they probably aimed for the building next to them .
you seem to be very unlucky with your devices lol .
you ca n't experss your opinion freely there ... even telling others that buying chromium is a trap would get you banned .

however your rates are paid to a local government essentially they are a tax .
a land tax is kinda like rates your pay to the government ... .would n't it be the state government ?

currently using 1more triple driver in-ear earphones https www.audiophileon.com/news/1more-triple-driver-in-ear-headphone-review they 're good value for the price you pay about 100 usd .
i definitely recommend them if you 're somewhat on a budget .
they are n't wireless though so you might need a dongle to connect if your phone does n't come with a headphone jack .
as shitty as this is you are only hearing one side of the story so lets not fully shit on blizzard and activision just yet .

okay so my future for anime is actually still pretty optimistic !
i do n't know why i put off some of these kaleido star i was actually about to start but the crunchy unblocker broke as i loaded the 1st episode and then i never got back around to it several of these i have already downloaded etc .
a general case of not now '' applies to some of them .
but often i just feel like watching something that i have low expectations for because then i can just phase-out while watching it or be pleasantly surprised when it keeps my attention
i have an odd habit of binging through things i kinda like but not super like much faster than things i really enjoy .

it 's the same ol symptoms but they 're randomly put together and it feels extremely jarring .
it 's more exhausting and energy consuming but they typically do n't last that long .
vulnerability usually peaks so if you need to hit up the safety plan do it .
if you can hold on but it 's sticking around try to eat something filling not junk food avoid sugars unless you 've eaten a nutrient dense meal first .
do n't change med plan if you 're on one talk to doc if you think a new med is causing this .
also the weed i 'm a lifelong cannabis user i will get alienated high if i blaze too heavily during vulnerable times .
it 's very unlikely the weed has you still freaking out much more likely that it 's a prolonged mixed episode although it may have started with nye and then your stress of feeling distant from friends could be fueling the prolongation .
either way you 're very likely to recover but like i said earlier make the call if you 're in the danger zone .
no because we destabilise a fuckload of countries and then blame them for it

ah yes i miss that everest guy yelling at me through the tv
sounds like youve got a lot to unpack on your chest .
you may be surprised how much it could help !
fair enough you 've been more than civil it 's just i 've heard all these arguments before .
unfortunately i doubt you 'd be convinced even if you saw jesus himself float down on a cloud and tell you himself .
this is a common attempt at downplaying the non religious argument quite the opposite if i was provided with evidence i 'd certainly consider it .
i just do n't see the point in faith without anything further .
and just so you know a book is n't really what i 'd consider proper research it 's just an opinion .
unless it 's peer reviewed with a proper method it does n't hold much scientific weight .

ukraine.. like kansas is the bread basket of the continent .
i believe i may have been a spoiled child ...
i have no idea how i grew out of this but i remember seeing an old home movie of myself at maybe 5.. and it was a christmas video .
i thought there was a gift for me and i started to open it it was gently taken from me and i freaked out and screamed heyyyyyyyy !
presents ! needless to say thanks to my grandparents me and my sister 's christmases were unbelievable ... loads of gifts .
like i said i really do n't know if something happened but somehow i grew up to be a minimalist .
i mean when i do want something i want the best version of it but i do n't need many accessories or anything like that for it ... and usually i want to buy it myself instead of receiving it as a gift .
maybe all those years of being spoiled and my mother 's psychological abuse made me feel like i do n't deserve gifts .
i 'll never forget the one day when i asked her if she 'd buy me a cereal brand i 'd been wanting ... then of course she had one of her episodes i have no idea what diagnosis she had but maybe one day i 'll find out and freaked out on me took a deep inhale like she always did before she talked and loudly yelled i do n't have the money ! ! ! !
you just want want want want want want want and i ca n't afford it ! yet she always had money for her cigarettes.. but anyway.. just ... it confused me too .
because one year i wanted to prove to my friends that i was n't spoiled .
they thought because i had nice things i was a spoiled brat .
so the christmas i was 15 i asked for one thing .
i said all i want is a pair of red lens round-frame glasses .
i got a grapefruit sized crystal ball a book of witchcraft a ring that said harm none an amethyst crystal necklace an altar cloth and a pack of tarot cards ...
i wanted to prove to my friends that my mom bought me things so she had ammunition to yell at me later .
as if i asked for all those things how ungrateful of a child i am etc .
but since then i 've never asked for much i prefer to not own many things .
maybe someday over time i 'll have a house full of nice things i worked for and i can say i worked for those things .
he knew him but adam did n't like tommy because of the build-off drama with jimmy .

i just do n't like anyone downplaying epstein 's heinousness i do n't feel like that was necessarily your intent do n't get me wrong cause he 's a walking shitstain that i would n't mind seeing someone turn into a pez dispenser .
he deserves to rot in a cell for life and the only reason he is n't is because he has money and either bribed or blackmailed his way to that horseshit 18 month sentence .

the kid has been misparented so bad and has no respect for authority .
from the time he was about 7-11 he would throw temper tantrum if he was n't allowed to bring his ipad to the table .
most recently he was given a brand new computer setup not sure of specs that cost over 3000 to put together and used it twice simply because he got bored of playing fortnite on xbox with a mouse and keyboard .
he used it for a week and then went back to xbox because he would get shit on and then throw a tantrum .
this christmas he got a brand new 2018 macbook pro with all the lace and frills .
because his 2016 macbook took 15 seconds to start up instead of the 3 it used to .
he 's allowed to drink coffee and stay up till 3 or 4 at the ripe old age of 13 .
he swears at my uncle and aunt and even his grandparents without a care .
i ca n't wait until life smacks him in the face at 18 .

a human doing experiments on another human even for progress is evil until certain stuff has been passed .

i think you 're inquiring about floorplate size rather than podium size .
podiums are the first few storeys of a building that typically take up the entirety or most of the lot and then which the tower rises out of .
floorplates are the term for the size of each concrete-poured 'slab ' .
for one hamilton already has regulations on the size of tower thickness which is set at 750 sq meters .
as well while you could cram more units into a thicker tower the unit size and arrangement would be compromised .
big plentiful windows are a selling feature for buyers and renters .
if a developer crams too many units into a tower you 're going to end up with lots of long-and-skinny units with few windows which do n't sell as well .
as well you do n't typically see tall buildings using their entire lot size as a tower as podiums are popular and represent a way to increase return by adding commercial retail and office space .
the developer there has proposed 2 towers when he could 've built a single connected tower and squeezed in an extra 4 or so units per floor .
that has n't happened though because buyers and renters want windows want balconies and want amenities .
so instead that space that could be used to build a thicker less elegant tower is a swimming pool on the third floor of the podium .
i feel like the horrific airing schedule is working against the show .
nothing like waiting a month for 4 beach city episodes with a ronaldo one for good measure while the last 30 seconds of the 5th episode is a massive cliffhanger for the rest of the arc to be started in another 3 months .

if they reenter sideways perhaps with a bit of a spin to distribute the heat evenly the engines would n't get blasted a lot providing they are sufficiently shielded from the side and the heat would be soaked in the fuselage .
the problem i see with this is that a booster that is almost empty would have its centre of mass near the engines which would make the booster want to reenter engines first .
so perhaps the sideways position could be maintained by rcs thrusters however i have no idea how much fuel they would need just to maintain that position and if it would be worth it .

as soon as i turn on the shower i get a very sudden urgency to pee .
normally the sound of water has no effect on me .
even if i need to pee the sound does n't make it worse .

i may not be the best help but my new rescue does the same thing .
constant tail chasing we first thought was cute and funny but now realise she has some kind of anxiety problem .
she also thrashes her toys a lot mostly when stressed and sometimes gets jumpy barking and snapping at us non aggressively for seemingly no reason .
a recent vet visit left her in a state she was spinning and pacing and barking the whole time the vet said its very likely that she was previously left alone or confined a lot so has picked up these habits as a way to entertain herself and cope with her struggles .
she said it can be difficult to sort the problem depending on the reasons why she does it but we 're definitely going to try .
we have a behaviourist coming later today so if she says anything important about this that may benefit you i 'll try remember to update you .
the other thing to note is that my case is a rescue dog where i do n't know her history .
i 'm hoping that you knowing your pups history may be easier to find the reason behind it but i would recommend getting help from a certified behaviourist as they would be the best at telling you why your dog does it and what to do .

depending on how you 're monetized and a bunch of vaguely defined factors you can make anywhere from 500 bucks to several thousand bucks for a million views .
for channels that are big that 's millions in revenue a year .
you get yourself north of 100k subs and release daily content that they all watch ?
you can live a pretty decent life off that and maybe even sustain the cost of paying an employee to help you with video editing and such .
you get north of 250k and you 're easily paying someone else to help with production and becoming a small production company .
north of 500k to 1 million subs and you 're a bonafide business just off ad revenue .
and most of these people do n't rely on ad revenue alone they get sponsorships patreon sell merch etc .
having a million subs on youtube can easily make you a six figure salary if not make you a millionaire .
his books are the very first ones i remember reading and loving .

buuuut ... mouse and keyboard being prevalent in ps4 does complicate things .

also fyi mobility does n't do anything for sprint speed though there is certain exotics that improve sprint transversive steps mida tool s etc .
so there may be some insight behind his rants unlike most wrestling fans .

it was a pedestrian effort from a band that could do a lot better if they were n't complacent touring on old material for years on end .

do you expect nvidia 's ptx to be replaced eventually ?
part of the problem is that amd 's gcn architecture shares the same name as the instruction set .

so its not like they 're all the same .
we are specifically talking about an ipad in this case ... been a while since i activated an ipad but i know an iphone ca n't just be turned on used on wifi straight out of the box without going through the basic activation/setup process and the differences between iphone/ipod/ipad seem to be getting smaller with each release .

i think about this so much i think he would have died in paris or went back to christianity full time and stayed in frankia .
i think there would be an awkward confrontation between him and √¶thelwulf .
i do n't think he would assume any responsibility over alfred he 's not really father material .
ragnar probably would n't have given himself to alle which means the great heathen army would n't have happened .
maybe √¶thelwulf would have killed athelstan and ragnar take out revenge on england through that motive as well as the destruction of the colony .
i really stick to the theory that he would 've died in paris though either in battle or by the hands of the franks for his betrayal .
even though ragnar would n't have sabotaged the battle .
it 's probably a. telephiastrum based on those small pink leaves .

in the example you gave regarding bridge on the river kwai the implication there is of a probable 'trademark ' dispute .
one product 'passing itself ' of as the other .

there are plenty of films with either the same or similar names neither of which are prevented or protected by copyright unless under very exceptional circumstances eg .
do n't conflate trademark with copyright though they are two different beasts .
trademark infringement can occur even if the names are different .
the measure is whether one product is passing itself off as the other .
fortunately most states have waived sovereign immunity to an extent under their respective tort claims acts .

helene wecker 's the golem and the jinni is probably my favourite fantasy novel at the moment .
i like that it 's a sad and romantic book that spends as much time exploring the side characters as the protagonists .
it 's beautifully written and the audio is beautifully read .
possibly because it 's the only series i 've finished in recent memory but that says a lot about how much i liked it .
all four books just have so much of what i love .
ghosts mysteries friendships folklore and beautiful people being charming .
they would be taken off site to be shot but gassing is more likely .

certainly the top level is male 99.9 male dominated but i have no idea the gender of the people i play against unless they specifically say something about it/voice chat etc.. so just from personal experience alone it could be 50 which i know is n't true ... but you get my point hopefully
i feel like enough fights end up with everyone spread out around the boss that it could work if it has some kind of supplemental ability even if it 's just something like a channeled dance that pulses healing in a radius comparable to helios/lustrate/medica .

since other comments have n't seemed to mention this personality does n't make someone transgender .
more of less gender is a matter of which sex-based characteristics/appearance cause someone the least distress/the most comfort .
more often than not those sex-based characteristics are the ones that one 's birth sex hormone produce .
however with trans people those sex-based characteristics are usually the ones produced by the opposite sex hormone .
regardless of culture testosterone and estrogen create two consistent types of bodies and gender is which one is most compatible with one 's mind
gender is sex-related but not the same as sex .
the thing people do n't understand about all of this is owners are now embracing creativity and innovation on offense while not looking for any innovation on defense .
that 's the reason for the offensive explosion until the defensive minds catch up it 'll be offensive head coaches 9 times out of 10 .

i did go to mempho fest this past year and they had 3 which is the only place i 've seen that .
not saying others do n't but the 4/5 fest i 've been to only had one dj every time i went .
i recall from my childhood that every time i did indulge in my sheets was because i dreamt of the loo and they were the best leak i took .
i then stopped when i had learnt to recognize when i was and was n't dreaming .

then the wetting ended forever since i made sure the costs outweighed the benefits and forcing my lazy sleeping ass from the bed to the toilet was a preferable option .

it sounds like people who were using spatial 's platform are sol but people can still deploy their own servers with spatial unity .
... which is likely a different 'package ' that costs a different amount of money ?
you can rent server space from us for or you can pay and be able to run your own servers .
oh darn you mean unity wo n't let us do the cheaper version ?
well now you have to fork over tons of money or go to a competing product .
what do you mean you 're all indie developers with limited funds and ca n't afford our prices ?
i have to wonder if unity was demanding a flat price or a percentage .
and i wonder if the tos was changed after improbable did the work and created their business model or before .
improbable claims the change was made in december of 2018 .
spatialos has been a thing since at least 2015 .
unity claims they pointed out the breach as early as early 2018 maybe late 2017 ?
but that still is years after spatialos was a thing .
what specifically is the part of the tos that improbable is violating and when did it appear ?
someone else not me i have to go to bed might be able to use the internet wayback machine to find out the history of unity 's 'software terms of service ' and see when they put the specific restrictions in .
looks to me that it mentions something about cloud services when they redid their site in july 2016 but improbable has been working on their tech for longer than that and they mention spatialos at least as early as november 2015 if not earlier .
i wonder if improbable saw an interesting way of implementing tech implemented it and then unity changed their tos to try to get a cut of it .

i was thinking because it was a happy hour meetup there was an opening to circle back to her at some point in the evening .
so another option is she could have been feeing tipsy badass flirty walking by you and basically giving you a upvote knowing there was no time for you to follow through .
the reason i said it 's unlikely a 100 good samaritan gesture is because when you physically interact with a strange guys clothes/hat/hair you simply have no idea who you are dealing with and you might end up wishing you had a security detail for the rest of the night .
there are guys on the opposite spectrum as you they will find hints where there are zero hints and can be insistent relentless and ugly about it .
so it 's only worth it is the guy looks interesting approachable not creepy .

however i just was n't ok with it given the history because even if you do n't want to sometimes alcohol makes you say f it .
fuck that took me too long to get it guess i 'll die ...
while i sort of agree with you i do n't necessarily think alcohol is just a truth serum '' ... i think it more completely takes away your filters and inhibitions so that any thought flying around becomes of the absolute importance to share there and then ... .especially if anxiety is involved then any negative thought you have is going to feel truly real without any input from your logical brain to argue it away .
so yeah i 'm more likely to spill my secret truths but also i 'm more like to say anything that pops into my head however fleeting
black ops 2. not necessarily for the story as i never finished it but it came out when i was in middle school i think and to be able to relive all those memories with my friends again would be something else .
the bios has a microcode version but the os can always load a newer one if configured which is typically true more so recently due to spectre/meltdown
reproduces on windows and also with oldish bioses oldish linux iso before the whole spectre meltdown stuff .
the person in that w520 thread mentioned something like bios 1.06 or so for w520 where they started seeing the problem .
i have n't tried a bios that old yet .
i 'm not using any of these but for example the birthday or anniversary shirts that you change the year .
or the t-shirt seller that 's practically made a whole business from straight outta .
they have like a gazillion straight outta shirts now .
i try to make more original designs but one that can be scaled like this .
that makes it possible to create 50 or more t-shirts in a day when i need to .
the cat just did a body slam off the top rope !
hey i can give you a medicants staff for a quick mule and 2 souls of a great champion or 40k souls equivalent
those are rooky numbers you better pump those numbers up
i feel that the trade weight limit should be affected by lack of wagon though doesnt appear to be .
also having a three tile entrance to trade/craft zones allow easier traffic flow/haulage and stuff .

technically it 's contender over mk23 now if you look at top rankings that is if you have a contender .
they 're both just two non-standard protagonists that do n't fully grasp everything going on around them and suffer for it .
that is way too vague lol nothing i said was that vague xd but nice try .
pat yourself on the back for picking up on an autocorrected mistake ...
well you would think mangadex would enforce their own rules as has been pointed out to them in regards to this group multiple times yet the group still uploads scans with their own self proclaimed obnoxious watermarks '' that their mangadex group page even stated so when mangadex rules state obtrusive watermarks are not allowed . ''
but the case and point is you brought up the no watermarks plastered all over the place '' but mangadex do n't care to enforce this rule and probably others unless i guess if its for a popular series or from a popular group .
i think he was destined to fail on that team .
i think that team had to fail to clean the decks and start again .
while his performances were not good on many occasions i dont think he was the worst player on that team .
and if you do n't mind me asking how old are you ?
and how long were you working with her enduring her harassment before you reported to the hr ?
well guess its just a matter of waiting for the patch with the fixes whatever the devs decide on as annoying as it is
you dont have to get mad yourself to play violent character .
when playing as a person that is not like yourself understanding her is the key .
make it a very vague trigger so that it fits in many situations that way she will be a consistent and very angry character .
maybe she'very impatient and whenever someone takes too long talking/shopping/looting/not dying for enemies she gets angry .
maybe she gets angry when anything goes not as she was expecting it to go .
i had simmilar problem when we were playing evil one-shot .
i decided to go with melee strength-based warlock fiend patron and greatsword as pact weapon .
he was a face of the party and really nice guy ... right untill he lured his victim into secluded area then he showed his murder-happy side .
long story short during that game there was a situation when he was alone with an disposable npc so he killed her .
i was struggling with that decision for a long time irl because it was completely against how i usualy play and there were a lot of other options but this situation was my characters trigger so i sticked to his modus operandi .
and that decision made a really memorable scene and had led to quite interesting consequences .
yeah once you hit 45s there is a lot of lagswitchers .
meanwhile you 'll be experiencing a lot of disconnects users just like you saw in my video .
i love carrying a pen in my pocket that is reliable and portable if you like the idea you should like the kaweco sport it 's light affordable and very pocket friendly .
the kaweco sport was my beginner pen and it remains in my right pocket daily‚Äîca n't go wrong with it .
so according to you if the commenter was just making a bad joke but did n't really mean any harm then the comment was n't an insult .
i think the opinion of the target does matter for that very reason .
if intent is all that matters then there 's no such thing as microaggressions and ultimately the feelings of oppressed people do n't actually matter .
that paradigm has n't worked out so well in the past .
do they greet everyone with welcome to the dark side '' ?
got kicked from a game cause i did n't want to throw like the rest of them .
got team killed in another game cause they thought it was funny
the hard part about math and subjects like physics or chemistry that involve a lot of math is that they 're really cumulative and you have to keep up with the daily work .
it 's really hard to maintain that kind of discipline and focus when you 're depressed like that .
i think that 's why i had easier times in social sciences and humanities because i could have a good day and read a novel or a chapter of book without worrying about the three weeks i had n't really covered .

the best thing you can buy is anti-armor explosive pump it will easily kill anything except sbq solo .
it 's more rare since it apparently was n't duped like it 's no tomorrow .
i had tse handmade pump and 50cal sold them no regrets .
do n't like combat meh range and gatling just meh .
tse shotgun is useless since it gives you just one more pellet anti-armor is a better choice imho .
edit by useless i do n't mean it 's bad it 's just two-shot is not an ideal mod for a shotgun .
it is stated that ludoshel is 200,000 pl i believe
psa the website is a scam and they do n't actually sell cars .
all the pictures are just pictures of the real cars taken from other websites .
instead of florida spending billions on sewer upgrades would n't the wiser thing be to start converting all toilets to compost type or the ones that burn the shit ?
all water would than be grey and a drain field could handle that .
besides with rising water levels would just destroy sewer pipes quickly not really solving anything .
do n't want to be that annoying one but i 'm curious why assume it contains any truth to begin with ?
same though i do enjoy the mod that makes monster 's faster when enraged i do n't use it online but it was fun to play offline overbreak
let 's me play with others and hang out in game .
i think i would be more okay with the layered armor transmog if it did n't show online that just seems a bit ... risky .
as well as the fact as you can cheat and get layered armor that could be earned

how exactly do you think a wall will make any difference when cbp is so under staffed ?
two guys patrolling every 100 miles wont suddenly be able to catch all the illegals simply because it takes them 10 extra minutes to climb a ladder .
a wall is only effective if illegal crossings only work with overwhelming numbers .
but that 's not the case they work because they 're going undetected .
why not hire 100s of more cbp agents or buy some helicopters or drones for them so they can sweep the border very quickly ?
haha that 's true man i was hoping as they 've done that with previous ones we had staggered it so one was 150k and then next 1k oh well another grind session with only a barrett as my bonus lol

a quick google search for this controller brings up a handful of other users experiencing the same issue across a multitude of different ssd vendors that have opted to use this controller for their latest ssd offerings .
a handful of failures which would be well within the standard expected manufacturer defect rate is cause to claim that the controller is somehow defective ?

one time as a little kid i was visiting in virginia and tried to write a letter back to my friend but i accidentally spelt virginia as vagina and my dad was really upset with me .
me too it 's soooooo annoying having these feelings i 'd say ignore these feelings people that do n't want to spend time with you will make it obvious !
we just overthink and make things so much harder for ourselves by doing that .

i 'm talking of non-standard syntax which hinders interoperation with other shells a very common operation .
extensions are ok for interactive use such as completion history and colouring but syntax is fundamental and must allow turning command line into a script and running parts of scripts interactively and running these on different hosts owned by different parties .
so non-standard syntax is an absolute no-go and only bin/sh is allowed for the scripts .
my last cat was always doing that too or stare at me with judjing/angry eyes .

he had his armor enchanted and sold pumat the worse armor and deducted the cost .
technically they did find a magic staff marisha just did n't realize it .
they found a staff that warms the hands of the holder .
a minor enchantment that does n't have any combat benefit but enchantment enough to count as magical and overcome resistance to mundane weapons .

how often have i been hunting for an outlet at the airport because my phone was about to die ?
he did direct another film though an adaptation of dostoevsky 's the double with jesse eisenberg it was like a ya david lynch film good fun really .
i wish richard ayaoade directed more films though he is clearly very good when you look at the films he 's directed and the films he has taken inspiration from .
in the uk he spends a lot of time on channel 4 with programmes like the crystal maze reboot and travel man 48 hours in ... which are very entertaining as he 's clearly allowed to bring his distinctive sense of humour to both programmes but i 'd also love to see him make more films in the future .
he 's written a few books too actually the tail end of 2018 saw him release his first novel whereas his book ayoade on ayoade a cinematic odyssey is like a sarcastic autobiographical interview where he asks himself interview questions and provides his sly sharp sense of humour in the form of jokes that your film school buddies would giggle at .

i know people say wait on veromos but i 'm not close to veromos and i already have all the 5 star stuff ready for one and still have 5 of the big rainbowmons laying around for veromos when i get him .
it seems like being able to do faimon hell would save me energy and get me more fodder .
i dont see the point in letting a 6 star worth of mats just lay around when they are ready to be placed on someone and i thought about bella but thats not exactly going to help me right now where farming faimon hell instead of hard would .
if i had n't bypassed the 3/4 star fodder for all the fusions i would think differently but with work and other tasks before i knew it i just kept leveling fodder to max 5 .
you know at work dont have time to sift through monster box just find a max fodder level him start again .
so now i have a 6 star ready to go and the choices are bella or lapis .
they were very clever in their wording of everything .
there was no lie written on the red bus .
it was disingenuous and deliberately misleading but that 's political campaigning for you .

very nice of you to call a 16-year-old girl an ugly fuck. jesus man .
i may be wrong and you may be 100 pro bikes or you may be wrong and you are unknowingly a bit anti-bikes .
i suspect the truth is somewhere in the middle .
my opinion is based on hearing similar arguments from others and small choices in wording your arguments .
the risk of injury and loss of life is certainly much greater for cyclists than for drivers but that 's a risk many cyclists choose to take
logically there is nothing objectionable in what you are saying but the way you worded it puts all the onus on the cyclists .
the risk of injury and loss of life is certainly much greater for cyclists than for drivers so that 's a responsibility every driver must accept .
you also admit that this bugs you on your commute presumably because you are anxious in the mornings and hungry and tired in the evenings .
but those things are your problems that you are emotionally shifting onto the cyclists .
remember that is their commute too and driver irritability at those times is more than just an inconvenience for them .
cars were a menace from the start and drivers immediately felt that they had more right to the roads .
it 's a subtitle thing that boils down to vulnerability .
people naturally behave more aggressively towards the more vulnerable when they appear to be competing for some resource .
it 's not that some people are jerks which is true but when a cyclist gets into a car they unconsciously push others around too .
we all need to remind ourselves that when annoyed by a cyclist in front of us we need to give them the same respect we would give to a slow car occupying the same space .
this also applies to the visibility problem you described .
if you had to brake hard after cresting that hill that means you were n't allowing enough stopping distance to accommodate cyclists pedestrians or slow vehicles .
after a particularly gruelling session in near 30c heat at the nad al sheba sporting complex on wednesday there was initially not a great deal of appetite for some games .
but that soon changed when the squad was divided into three 8-a-side teams academy graduates and goalkeeper david de gea in one another made up of older heads and a third side compromising everyone in between and told they were playing a winner-stays-on tournament .
it got so competitive that the players were pleading with the coaching staff to let them carry when things were eventually wrapped up and the youthful side featuring the likes of marcus rashford andreas pereira scott mctominay tahith chong and angel gomes emerged triumphant and revelled in playfully mocking their senior counterparts .
very happy the mood has changed at the club my only fear is big games and how ole approaches them which we 'll see sunday .
but even if we get beaten i think the mood will stay up .
20 minute naps on your lunch break works wonders for general energy and attentiveness and anything adrenaline inducing in the free time you have helps .
got back on a skateboard and snowboard after a two/three year hiatus .

at the end of the day work is mad repetitive regardless of your industry .
i really think if a filmmaker understands the spirit of the game universe it could be done right .
and not even necessarily as animation a live-action film could absolutely capture that spirit in a way that fans of that universe would recognize and appreciate .
do you have a perrin shift stop in yet ?
that helps a ton to just get it in gear easily .
the clutch is definitely a trip and it took me awhile to get used to but i do n't have much of a problem anymore on the stock tune .
i also installed the perrin brass bushing and a heavier knob .
my general rule is to get out of 1st as quickly as possible at all times haha .
i do n't launch on stop lights or race people etc so i ca n't help there ... good luck
as long as you contribute the best way you can it 's all good

how could a decrease in total amount of labor performed per household somehow increased household prosperity by itself ?
i could understand it affecting childless households but as is your entire chain of logic is absurd .
you 're ignoring my evidence and carrying on chanting big daddy state and unions saved us ! ''
and missing the fact that value of labor increases costs of living decreased and it became much more reasonable for working families to invest into their children 's long-term success via education instead of sending them to work .

if something is developing and you cause considerable changes in its function while its developing it will likely develop incorrectly right ?
the reason it 's hard to call it harming '' is because there is n't a clearly defined good/bad result in every person .
evidence tends to point towards it having negative effects on attention and cognitive development .
it has also been evidenced to worsen cognitive development in younger users so exposure as a fetus when the brain is first developing in the womb does n't seem like a good idea either .
while the nature of studying pregnant mothers smoking weed is a sort of morally grey area what research that has been done has tended towards negative effects on multiple dimensions of cognition .
like you who asked how a plant could be harmful ?
like a person that thinks its worth it to reply to someone who is saying they do n't see a problem with potentially smoking weed during a pregnancy ?
that sort of shit could affect a child 's entire life .
about the same age they have kids so do we .
he was a stay-at-home dad for a long time .
a few times it was mentioned they could n't afford another car it was difficult to save money .
they did not hide their political affiliation and frequently talked negatively about the other party while waiting for the school bus .
dad finally got a job on an on-call basis ... but he did n't have a car .
so he started asking me for rides when i was around .
sometimes the job was an hour away but i get it he wants to make money to help support his family .
i helped him when i was home and i took him to work whether it was 5 minutes down the street or in the next county .
just a twelve year old 4 door domestic sedan .
paint was still glossy good amount of newer parts in it .
one day i offered him the keys and title to the car .
i would n't accept money from him because i did n't pay anything for it myself nor did i know the actual condition of it .
it started and drove in my driveway when i jumped it but it was towed there and i 'd never taken it over 2 miles an hour .
turns out all it needed was a 110 battery and now the guy has a reliable car to drive to work and is able to accept as many on-call assignments as he wants to take now .
his wife is n't driving all over the state anymore after working all day to pick up her husband at work .
they became to be in a better place financially .
i thought i gave them a winning situation and i might 've liked someone to do the same for me .
we all want to feel useful to our families .
we 're very republican and they 're staunchly aggressively democrats ... and that 's ok with me .
a few months later we all find ourselves in the hallway together at the elementary school our kids attend waiting during parent/teacher conferences .
there were five sets of us parents total in the scene .
all of a sudden the guy 's wife started talking ... strangely she almost began the whole thing mid-story or mid-sentence like she 'd been having a conversation with someone and decided to interrupt .
she was n't talking to her husband she was addressing all of us a group .
flipping out about donald trump and immigration and how he needed to be removed from office .
my wife who 'd never ever discussed our political affiliations with them was unable to control herself and said he does n't know how to talk to people i know that .
but he 's done a lot of really good things for the country i do n't think anyone else could have done '' .
i looked around all of the other parents slyly looked away and all .
the neighbor 's wife noticed as well and began sobbing softly .
an hour later she 'd defriended my wife from facebook and they both act very casually disinterested in us at the bus stop .
like we 're good enough for a quick fake smile but then we 're ignored .
we 're republican and they 're staunchly aggressively democrats ... and that 's not ok with them .

the department of defense has expressly held that this same rationale applies to distributions from limited liability corporations .
the reference is to this http ogc.osd.mil/defense_ethics/resource_library/emoluments_clause_applications.pdf paper on page 5 paragraph 3 it reads
accepting a share of partnership profits is considered an emolument where some portion of the share is derived from the partnership 's representation of a foreign government .
olc has determined that because the partnership would be a conduit for that foreign government payment a portion of the recipient 's income could be attributed to a foreign government .
this is so even if the individual subject to the emoluments clause did not actually provide services to the foreign government .
in other words a distribution from a partnership that includes some proportionate share of revenues generated from the partnership 's foreign government clients is an emolument .
we believe that this same rationale applies to distributions from limited liability corporations although this view has not been officially sanctioned by the department of justice .
so it 's not the official stance of the department of justice but it is the stance of the dod who wrote that paper .
i think nina and coco proved the best way to do it is to make a character so i 'd probably do a queen as the shriveled wrinkled wheelchair fish from spongebob as lady bunny 's old mom .
nobody except someone who lives and breathes ibanez can identify any of this .
i think it 's because of his indifference to her rather than just outright hatred .
i did n't know and still barely know how he feels about her .
we actually had similar childhood experiences both our mothers did drugs had abusive and toxic relationships and are generally jn .
i guess i didnt want to be full nc unless he outright said lets go nc '' .
i actually showed him my post and he wants to remain vlc with a ton of boundaries unless she fucks up .
i 'm truly sorry for you experiences with abuse and i 'm sorry your partner doesnt understand your feelings or wishes .
my father is the jy out of my 2 parents but he still has very toxic traits that he is trying to fix .
i correct him as much as possible but overall i think i overlook a lot because his father was verbally abusive and caused my father to seek out love and approval from anyone .
he is in a wonderful relationship now with my jysmom she is the best she took over mom duties when my mother didnt show up or contribute to my wedding and she is helping him a lot .
she knows my feelings and is basically acting as the bridge between our conflicting yet similar personalities we are both stubborn but have opposing views .
but anyway that 's my long way of saying i agree that i have to better establish boundaries with many relationships in my life .
i 've gotten better since we found out about baby .
my dad likes to try and stake his claim '' or push boundaries '' by stating i dont care if you disagree i 'm doing with baby when it 's older '' .
i shut that shit down even if i agree because it is n't about right or wrong intentions it 's about him blatantly stating he would go against my wishes as parent if he thought he was right .
i 'm nervous about blocking on fb because i have no clue if that will put more stress on bil1 and sil since they sometimes depend on her for babysitting and see her more often than us .
is there any way they could suffer the consequences of my actions ?
i do n't want to put sil through any more stress .
and i 'm not certain it 's worth it now since i already barely hear from her .
it was va so they 're not likely to pull a dc and go easy and ignore that his dumping was for commercial profit and a felony just need to find the asshole first .
i apologize for my language i have no respect for people with zero regard for littering this guy is a bad human .
i have n't seen that maxwell gieco commercial in years
i ca n't say you are wrong when your argument is essentially trust him they 're working on it . ''

in toronto for example the bubble tea craze is real .
every shop that has good bubble tea has really reaped the rewards .
these shops charge 6-8 per drink and a lot of them have long lineups throughout the day .
op i actually think this is a great franchise to take on so long as you do n't invest behind one of the weaker performing bubble tea brands or try to force it by creating your own as you likely do n't have the branding skills for this yet .
also you need to evaluate your market and determine whether users are interested/have had it before .
if you can confirm there is a demand i say go crazy ...
yeah everyone is saying the girl is from a different state .

i legit just explained this isnt fake lol you can even see the world is all fucked up .
this is something that 's really common and happens a lot .
if you 've just shaved you may have only noticed it because the hair is shorter .
but mostly it happens when two hair follicles under the skin are so close together that they break the skin as one and then naturally split .
it 's not an issue though you should n't be worried .
because i worked for a firm where we had clients that were a true hassle ... would n't settle unless you got everything they wanted which is usually impossible .
every client thinks they have a billion-dollar case and if you ca n't get clients to be a bit more realistic things get harder .
sometimes you have to delay court proceedings because of that .

well the anal sex only lasted about two years and like i said he did everything right .
i really miss it but i 've only tried it with two people since then and it was not nearly as great .
i know my body stays tense down there all day every day and did so before trying anal i just did n't realize it might be odd til the dvd .
i really miss it so much of the way the internet worked back then .
i bet he 'll be pissed off to be waken up again

i would come back from living at school and my mom would n't greet me she 'd just immediately give me a list of chores she needed done .
my first year at school i came home for winter break and the first thing she said was good you 're home i have a chore for you . ''
and then she told me about how i was going to be helping our contractor install our new countertops when she had had the last 3 months to do it .
because they do n't want to clean it off afterwards .
it 's the dharma of every sanatani to fight against the likes of you
well i 'm not american so i ca n't say much but i do think so mainly because where i live we do have gun control and there have been no recent incidents of shootings at least not after the troubles

i really love the vivarium electronics brand the ve 300x2 is what i use .
it 's convenient if you have more than one enclosure as it has two separate probes that are designed to regulate two different heat sources .
that one is rather pricy but they have other cheaper models too !
in my experience they are really accurate and they have lots of cool features like alarms and night temp drop capabilities .
clearly it 's a slutty knight who is wearing a pineapple-themed helmet .
they have to mute the entire sound track except for ankle bully and then they can get those animations
there are all kinds of sites online that cater to this specific fetish .
there 's no need to be creeping on innocent people on the internet .
was n't expecting that but life advice is always welcome thanks man
nothing comes to mind really but one time i bought a really nice hat at the mall .
went to get gas afterward and thought i 'll throw away some trash while my car was filling up .
got home and realized i threw away my brand new hat within about 10 min of buying it .
it seems like there are other uses of that money that would save more people 's lives .
logically should n't we push for those programs first ?
in terms of immigration nobody ran on any of those .
so if i have to chose wall vs nothing i 'll take wall .
if you have something more effective try running it in 2020 instead of muh pussy tapes '' and you 'll get my vote .
but as you point out we can do two things at a time .
if we want to do everything that saves lives we need to raise the budget .
we ca n't do that forever obviously so some line must be drawn where the most efficient programs are funded and less efficient ones are not .
there is nothing wrong with questioning the efficiency of the wall .
but again 1 efficient is better than the alternative proposal which is 0 efficient
so the question comes back to how much do we value a life ? ''
and how many lives will the wall save per year ? ''
i believe that given the alternative solution which again is nothing '' the wall has an infinite benefit .
i 'm skeptical that the wall is on the efficient side and trying to understand your perspective better as you presumably disagree .
interestingly and on a unrelated note my editor refuses to number your responses as 123

i do n't know why you got so many downvotes .
when a bootleg company is far ahead of yours .
yeah honestly i wish when they released 2007scape that they just left it as it was and never updated it but thats just my opinion .

this seems like a very level headed approach to this .

i like the idea of establishing dominance and people knowing their place in the relationship .
it 's difficult for me to submit to someone who i dominated ... they are type casted '' in my eyes and i have trouble getting in the right mindset .
that 's just me though ... you might have better luck .
so why did you talk about how bad clitoris removal is in your previous comment ?
you do n't have a clitoris following your logic you should n't have an opinion on that .
is it that you ca n't tell me whether fgm is wrong or that you do n't want to be backed up into the irrational corner you walked yourself into ?

i would get these intense feelings sometimes and this started to happen after i met her .
the whole energy thing within me changed after i met her it was quite significant tbh .
at first i thought those feelings were me and i was randomly feelings weird shit within me then i consulted my friend who 's a psychic and she tole me that those are not mine and they are hers .
i feel her all the time even when im not in communication with her .
i actually can feel the emotions and energies of people in general but hers i feel it all the time..
sasuke 's eyes were originally uncle itachi 's so it 's not quite as close of a blood relationship as brothers would be .
if it is the same for everyone where is the problem ?
does n't make any difference pvp wise as long as its the same for everyone .
yes it also means that it takes longer to get good runes to beat scenario or higher floors .
but again as long as its the same for everyone i dont understand why you are complaining .
btw sometimes i got 2-3 6 in 10 runs from b7 but there are also times where i do 100 rounds and get no 6 .
it 's the handle but if you 're right-handed it may not be all that bad if you ever intend to use it for carving .

if it 's strictly for wood processing i 'd see about getting it replaced .
i have the same hatchet and i use it for light wood processing and quite a bit of carving though i have n't noticed that particular flaw in mine .
the fact that they can brigade downvotes stats/analysts opinions/facts about him stuck in group in 7 international events in a row tell a lot about these kids

that 's a one sided view because op is married to her father not just involved with him .
which means from daughter 's perspective maybe it 's not personal but from op 's perspective daughter is literally trying to destroy her personal life and hurt op emotionally .
how is it rational to prioritize the irrational teen 's view over op 's view or over whatever neutral middle ground view may exist ?
i 'm not suggesting anyone should break this horse but neither is continuing to allow her to rampage like this an option .

often at that point they 'll drop the act get through their script as quickly as possible then finally help me with my issue .
some days though i just ask for the supervisor right away .
of course they have little additional power or information but if i 'm wasting someones time out of principle because they 're wasting my time i wan na waste the time of the person there with the highest hourly rate !

i think the idea of cutting negative people out of your life is misinterpreted to be anyone who is negative at all rather than genuinely toxic people who make you feel shitty .
if people are willing to cut you out because you 're depressed and need someone to talk to they do n't really seem like a real friend .
and when they need someone to talk to they 'll have no one .
i think talking to family is best because they always love you .
your family members wo n't think they need to cut you out because they ca n't have negative people in their lives or at least they should n't .

you can search the plot for 1 2 and 3 is remastered on ps4 you could pick that up then get the new god of war .
or you could just google the plot for 1,2 3 either way it works but god of war 3 is actually a pretty good game .

no it uses a lithium battery which is standard for phones .
lead acid batteries are large high-output batteries that are usually only found in cars and first robots .
since the old testament foreshadows jesus christ and the new testament is sharply focused on jesus christ he is the sole means of redemption and salvation it makes good sense to start reading the bible with any of the four gospels .
i would recommend beginning with the gospel of john .
also as for translations i would recommend the new living translation nlt for someone new to the bible .

your protein and fat macro should look pretty similar or with one slightly higher
throwing in your numbers and some guesswork into the ankerl https keto-calculator.ankerl.com calculator you get
a reasonable 20 deficit in calories is 111g of fat .
that 's the kind of ratios you should be getting when you use these calculators .
getting close to a 1g:1g ratio between protein and fat makes it easy to actually eat without going over on anything and also works really really well for satiety .
then everybody would be required by law to kill themselves .
had yao guai there not as numerous as the ghouls but they just seemed to keep spawning in front of the cabins .
but like i said earlier i ca n't choose the rules every time .
at the time several other young girls in the area would get phone calls where a man would give various excuses sometimes friend sometimes co-worker but always asking the child if he could meet them and pick out a gift for their mom .
one family made a police report before amy was murdered .
anyway iirc children targeted were tied to the science center and to the stables where amy rode horses .
amy told a friend that she would be meeting a man that day to help pick up a present for her mother .
they discuss looking into anyone her mother may have known but there were no links found .
it really seems that children were being targeted in the area and amy is the only one who took the bait .
those episodes give a deeper look into her mother as well as her father .
the police also reference the phone call which really happened .
the brother called and just as the mother was leaving to head home the phone call from amy came in and amy seemed fine .
as soon as they hung up though it clicked to her mom that something was n't right so she headed home .
renner also appears and he talks a lot about the suspect he has had contact with .
and my fave episode is and he 's given me my p45 ... '' but they 've taken it offline presumably because they rip into keys and gray so much
i know that but i have n't seen the characters used anywhere else .
my first gas mask was also a mc-1 but in that shitty soviet grey color ...

first build was a full atx and i got sick of lugging it around for cleaning when i had a particularly large download had to move it to same room as modem and router .
so i decided to build an mitx build this time .
well i built it 2 days before my 1080ti arrived .
so i posted with my old hd7950 everything is a-o-k .
so i put in everything minus gpu ... some of you know how this is going manage the cables as best as i could hard as fuck let me tell ya and plug in power .
flip the switch annnnnd nothing on screen ... . fokin wot .
i lookup the error code beeps for the mobo in the manual ...
varying responses since the mobo was pretty new and not many have used them yet at the time .
well guess i 'm just gunna inspector gadget this shit .
i try three more times before i basically go into panic mode .
got ta take out the ram an re-seat it .
redo power connections in case they are too loose .
carefully take out the mobo which means wires are undone take out the heatsink and put in thermal paste .
since i was in panic mode i put a bit too much thermal paste .
i thought it was okay until i sat the heatsink and saw some thermal paste was leaking off the sides ... fuck .
take out heatsink and in my state of panic take out cpu to clean the mobo where paste hit ... and because i did n't clean my cpu first ...
i basically wan na hang myself at this point .
grab a toothpick and get to work carefully scraping thermal paste away from the socket holes takes me 3 hours probably would have been fine at an hour but i wanted to be thorough .
after cleaning i sit down and relax for a bit because i need the damn break .
after a small break i redo everything and power up everything up ... . and nothing .
i 've basically given up hope and hop on my old rig to play some games and just get my mind off things and relax because i was absolutely defeated .
after my i set my mind at ease and almost came to terms with my computers fate i look online one more time .
i dig deep and find a thread with where someone is having trouble posting their 1700 rig which was completely different from mine .
i come to find out ... these cpus do n't have any onboard video you need a gpu in order to post ... all that headache and worry because i never plugged in a gpu the second time ... fuck .
so i plug in gpu and surely enough it works just fine .
i was too happy to be upset at my idiocy .

i 've always had my parents tell me unless your contract says you have to be available 24/7 they can go fuck themselves .
if anyone complains you were n't reachable by phone or whatever over the weekend you politely point out that your contract does not require you to be always available and any time you have off work is your time for yourself .
of course if they want you available out of hours you can offer to renegotiate your contract .

please read the article understanding why uber loses money '' https news.crunchbase.com/news/understanding-uber-loses-money
the article 's summary is this in english the money that uber collects from fares is n't enough to pay for its revenue and operating costs therefore uber loses money each quarter . ''
if uber charged people the true cost of providing their service enough to make a profit i contend they would cost just as much or more than buses/trains .
also replacing buses and trains with individuals cars transporting 1 or 2 people increases the number of vehicles on the road and thus increases traffic congestion .

i usually save picks for punk rock simple basslines like better than ezra 's good '' when the bassline is too fast for fingers or when i feel the song needs the certain sound that picks give .
i have three different magic systems some have abstract limits and others have defined clauses .
users cannibalize and use devoured organic material to augment their body through permanent or manifested mutations .
augmentations and reality-warping powers are expressed in a unique melody that may or may not be audible .
ravenous-eater clause heretics who utilize permanent mutations will become increasingly animalistic reverting to primal beings of lust .
this is often seen in ravenous eaters a sub-category of heretics in which their desire to feed becomes greater than all other human desires .
you 'll see full-body mutations but luckily such an affliction usually prevents the heretic from further developing its melody stunting its growth .
advantages fully-body mutation ability to regenerate most of its body disadvantage predictability stunted growth .
affliction of a corrupted melody the cannibals among cannibals heretics that feed on other heretics develop melodies that allow a clause of reality to be bent .
this can not be turned off only suppressed to some extent .
heretics can and will kill themselves by forgetting their clause .
example a heretic lost her original identity through a power that allowed her to adopt the features and memories of those she devoured .
over-stimulation and blooming powerful heretics will emit an audible and often maddening melody when in an excited state .
most common among corrupted melodies an unknown clause lies in those who emit music .
if one becomes a ravenous-eater in this state due to over-stimulation their mutation does not stop at their defined state .
it is predicted that this clause has to do with a heretic 's links to a human world .
take these away and the heretic loses all connection with what it means to be human .
heat-based energy emission and body enhancement based on predetermined genetic factors .
emotional crutches casters rely on an emotional crutch as a conscious switch to release energy .
happiness sadness hope desire anger terror any emotion you can think of and there is probably a caster that relies on it although some are more popular .
the longer the caster stays in this state of focus the less he can discern this state as a predetermined switch .
the most powerful casters battle-casters those which are always enhanced and emitting will be devoid of any emotion other than their crutch .
added note a crutch can also be tied to an event young casters will be abused or manipulated to manufacture a crutch .
physical limitations casters are inbred to an extreme so they lack the proper biological channels to cast safely .
they use manufactured braces that restrict their dominate arms casting arms .
this brace seizes up with the flow of energy correcting the caster 's arm to prevent channeled energy from pooling .
take a wrong position or try to cast from the hip and the brace will snap your arm with ease .
on another note casters are only resistant to their heat and force they emit .
cast at a close range and you 'll be hit with your heat and force .
heat tolerance 80 of all casters will kill themselves through misuse and overuse of their enhancing and emission abilities .
they are only resistant to heat but the line that tells them what they can and ca n't handle is a one-way street that is easy to enter and hard to see .
if they go over their built tolerance by a few degrees their bodies will boil combust or explode this is referred to as skin boiling .
magical artifacts with defined uses that inflict a clause and punishment on users .
sight sickness punishment aspect first studied in supernatural creatures .
when a human experiences the unnatural reality corrects itself by inflicting punishment on the witness .
augmenting artifacts will cause the user to lose touch with humanity .
manifestation artifacts will cause the user to lose touch with reality .
none of these are set in stone and the punishment can get extremely specific to the point where artifacts may be freely used because the user has already lost the punishment 's source and differ among every single artifact .
these things get extremely complicated and are expressed better in-text where clever exploitation is easier .
added note punishments can be things like lost memories lost emotions and lost senses even really weird things like lost sense of time and lost sense of individuality .
individuals will have certain ways to use artifacts as none of them have an interface definable tool-use or on '' button .
find a way to exploit the tool 's uses that feels natural and the effects of the sight-sickness will be less break this clause and you 'll take on its full effects .
example a manipulation user controls 12 chains through the direction of his fingers and hands the movement feels natural and he can tie his movement with the movement of the chains .
when he accepts or realizes that it is not his movements that are making to the chain move but rather his imposed will he will be able to move the chains without movement of his hands but he will take on the full effects of knowing that he did so .
hipsters my man just like how cassettes are making a comeback https www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/03/boomtime-cassettes-50000-music-tapes-sold-last-year-retro-revival despite being infinitely inferior to more readily available digital formats today .
but seriously i know what you 're saying it does n't exactly square with the futuristic aesthetic who is to say the jar of pickles was n't replicated anyway .
it was a heartfelt call back to a shared reference between 2 characters .
it might be like someone buying a really nice fountain pen as a gift for someone today even though that person has n't handwritten a letter in 20 years .
i do think artisan and traditional food preparations would remain in the future though .
kind of like on star trek deep space nine where captain sisko 's father took pride in the fact his restaurant in new orleans did n't use any replicated food and that he put jake or benjamin to work scrubbing fresh clams http memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/clam when they visited .

not weird for the people who have to live with gypsies and seen how they behave first hand .
i will never forget in my hometown during 2007-2009 they built brand new aparment buildings for the gypsies .
they tore down the windows doors brand new btw and burned them.they start fires inside the apartments.they brought theyre horses inside the aparments.have you ever seen a horse watching you from a 3rd story block window ? ?
this is a conspiracy not many believe but i would not be surprised if it turned out that the tabloid newspapers in the uk made up the royals killed diana '' conspiracy to hide the fact that paparazzi photographers were the ones who caused the crash and prevented emergency services from getting to diana which actually caused her death .
celebrity news from the paparazzi is big business especially for tabloids like the sun express mail and a lot of other publications .
diana was beloved in her time and when she died there was a massive outpouring of grief for her especially in the uk .
i still remember laying flowers at the gates of holyrood palace .
after all they were the reason the car was going so fast .
the first people at the scene were paparazzi photographers .
when the emergency services did arrive they obstructed them and prevented them from getting diana out the car .
the idea that the paparazzi killed diana would 've placed a lot of backlash on the paparazzi and the tabloid press possibly seeing a levenson style situation where we hear a lot of fucked up shit about the press killing the celebrity news industry .
so they made a conspiracy about mi5 killing diana at the behest of prince phillip and they had the perfect conduit for their conspiracy a grieving father who wanted any answer he could cling to .
if they acted quickly and did n't obstruct the emergency services i believe diana may have survived .
a few people on this sub have grabbed lutch khl jerseys so it is probably worth it to check some old posts and see what others have said about sizing and look for some pictures .
i ca n't believe kobe continues to be disrespected by the media and on reddit at every turn !

you should n't even be thinking of cars like that .
twitter used to joke about it ironically but its turned into a completely justifiable behaviour when given the social backing and the incentive of going viral .
it 's truly toxic especially when you have people start exercising the idea that im going to do this totally unethical and inconsiderate thing because its my right and i 'm soooo over it lol im such a petty bitch but whatevs üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üíÖüèª

i need your help in less than a week my channel may be gone .
a company called 'believe music ' has been manually claiming my videos claiming they own my audio and visuals too so far they have put claims on nuvole bianche fly and beethoven 's moonlight sonata the latter dispute i have won .
if i do n't remove my copyright disputes and let them take all of my revenue the claims should be revenue sharing the videos will be deleted and i will have 2 copyright strikes on my channel meaning i may not be able to upload any new videos .
after that the only way to get my videos back would be to take them to court which as an independent musician i ca n't afford and if they decide to strike another video my channel will be deleted .
you are such an amazing community and i will keep you all up to date in the next few days i 'm so grateful for the support you 've all given me over the last 9 months now is the time i need it most .
in the comments of this post are links to my twitter instagram and reddit posts please help share this around if we make enough noise together we can help fix this problem on youtube .

hi i just wanted to make it clear that even if you do n't have endo you will always be welcome on this subreddit and i hope you will continue to be part of the community and find it useful as you share the experience of endo patients even if it does turn out in the end that you do n't actually have endo .
we slavs knew this for years but kept it secret so westerns would n't claim it as their idea
it goes up at a rate that is less than the interest rate you get in a hisa .
it 's not smart to pay it off unless you 're paying it all off to avoid the interest hit at the end of the financial year .

however it was pretty common to political prisoners to get suicided '' in those times .
particularly he was hanged with the belt of his suit which was impossible since prison uniforms did n't have belts and shoelaces .
plus he was a jewish and according to tradition he should be buried separated .
the rabin after examining the body ruled out that version .
in 1978 the government was found guilty of his death although nothing happened at the time .

ddg-verizon is well marketed as privacy focused and this has fooled a lot of people but ddg is actually just another centralized privacy abuser https www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/4vgqrn/duckduckgo_illusion_of_privacy/d5y8tdw .

the schism '' became theologically important only after the political cultural and doctrinal differences became unworkable .
it looks like the content to transcribe has been removed so i removed the post on our side .
my cat woke me up 7 minutes before my alarm clock was set to go off .
everyone has a right to an opinion but that does n't make every opinion right .
it 's detrimental for everybody when feelings are given the same weight as facts in an argument .
you are just removing the terrible washed out look the base game has .
but i think even then it was n't common knowledge in the sense of what common knowledge means today due to social media/the internet .
maybe because they still in highschool but who know momo might already done it with rito while he sleep xd
am i the only person who seems to work somewhere where everyone is generally nice these days ?
usually i just send an email saying i do n't feel too well and they just tell me to get better soon and that 's it providing i 'm not clearly abusing the system .
i have mad respect for healers since it can require some crazy multi-tasking something i absolutely suck at .
i liked 5 i 'm already subbed though like and sub here
15 wishes seems like it would break reality as you know it and take all the challenge out of life .
okay so you can fly have billions of dollars are basically perfect in every way are popular and literally all the challenge and accomplishment you were working towards has been gifted to you .
i feel like life would become terribly droll and repetitive within the first couple years .
with five wishes you can grow as a person and have those aces in the hole for when you come up against something you ca n't beat .
i think that if i had to choose five powers that would make life interesting without completely breaking '' the game they 'd be
not omnipotence but more the ability to remember everything you 've seen done experienced and the like .
2 total knowledge control of my body 's inner-workings like sensation sleep aging and fitness .
the upper-limits for physical performance would be something around a professional-athlete so no super-powers per se .
3 a personal aura that inspires honesty and good-faith with those i interact with .
they also tend to create arguments about nothing just because they feel salty about their own life .
when she is not upset or agrees with me it 's easy to discuss deep subjects .

i just assume that you did not take anything else that could interact with phenibut. ?

the legal status of phenibut is very different in different nations ranges from 100 unregulated to being regulated in medical law
yeah lotw said he did n't expect a apology or anything since he did n't expect jackiefish to come to his defense in the first place .
but apparently lotw got himself black listed by ca for making comments about tw as a series and where it 's heading .
on a serious note recently i 'm into dos2 and since i never modded gta v with at least 200 hours into this game well i 'm having a blast .

smiling at a female shop assistant in the street is tantamount to revealing yourself to be a serial killer .
or at least that 's my understanding based on their reaction .
nice now i can finally see how the gif ends
the trade always made sense since the mets needed a rhb corner if/of with power .
it 's gambling on a player with a lot of latent power potential and solid flexibility while giving up some talent that is far from the majors .
although the mets gave up a little too much for a risky unproven player like davis because luis santana was a high floor prospect even while still young and ross adolph looked like a highly athletic and polished college bat with potential .
the astros also were really interested in scott manea .
imo the keon broxton trade was more questionable unless the mets find a way to move lagares .
dude for sure i 'll take anything i have ahl players right now i appreciate that !
i am actually at work what time tomorrow would work best for you ?

it 's not og lucky '' ti i 'm highlighting about it just the they win millions u got nothing so stfu '' argument is fucking annoying .
it 's jesus kinda ranting against the leaders of the church of the time for being hypocrites and not practicing what they preach .
then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples 2 the teachers of the law and the pharisees sit in moses ' seat .
3 so you must be careful to do everything they tell you .
but do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach .
4 they tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people 's shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them .
5 everything they do is done for people to see they make their phylacteries a wide and the tassels on their garments long 6 they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues 7 they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‚Äòrabbi ' by others .
8 but you are not to be called ‚Äòrabbi ' for you have one teacher and you are all brothers .
9 and do not call anyone on earth ‚Äòfather ' for you have one father and he is in heaven .
10 nor are you to be called instructors for you have one instructor the messiah.11 the greatest among you will be your servant.12 for those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted .
he then goes on to talk give the seven woes where he calls them a brood of vipers which is an incredible insult tbh .
i built this bird feeder for my daughter for christmas .
although it 's been up for a few weeks we really have n't seen much activity ... until last night 's overnight snowfall and these guys showed up .
their lash princess mascara with the purple writing is my favorite although all the lash princess line is great .
i also love their make me brow gel and use it nearly every day on its own for a natural look that stays in place or over pencil for a lightly done look .
their pure nude highlight is one of my favorites especially now that i 'm moving to a more subtle preference in highlighters .
their eyeshadow can be hit and miss so i would recommend looking up reviews for each individual product but i have their metal shock liquid shadow in total eclipse and it 's nice .
that 's because you have a piece of unconventional knowledge a cursory understanding of programming basics .
not because the logistics chests work in an obvious manner just in a logical one .
on my ig explore page i had seen clips one of alyssa 's annie oakley and another of katya practicing for ruwu rolaskatox being shook .
i thought it seemed super entertaining and decided i had to watch it someday .
but then like a week later i was listening to greedy and all the comments were about valentina .
i was curious as to what the fuss was about so i went and found the lip sync was gagged that she did that because even without the context of the show i could tell that she did something wrong but bold af .
instead of waiting for someday i ended up starting it that night and well here i am lol

alright so a core that looks like marth lukas and raven bonus unit would be good then ?
shame i ca n't use my faves but it 's alright .
for now i should probably be focusing on saving feathers for merges so i can really bring my team to light .
by the way what is your take on lukas ?
i find him cool and especially tanky since i 've given him ss4 and qr3 but his res seems to be a glaring problem and i read that dragons are huge in higher tiers .
would a berkuts with res refine be enough or should i look towards other units ?
i prefer infantry but i could always go for something else .
its the fact that we do n't have a backup center .

the only explanation i can give for egypt is that an intern made an error in excel .
the tag title match was tied for match of the night in my opinion .
nearly as good as it gets from start to finish a tag team wrestling clinic .
i liked the decision to put the titles on gibson and drake nxt uk needs to create some stars and moustache mountain have their names made in nxt already they did n't need it as much .
balor was a great surprise and really added some star power to the event .
was n't really familiar with dennis and mastiff but they put in a good showing i 'll wait to see more before i draw conclusions about them .
rhea has a very unique look and in ring style she 's quite the presence great future ahead of her for sure .
storm 's victory was definitely the most emotional moment of the night the crowd was really behind her and you could tell it meant a lot to her especially after the incident with the leaks and all of the talk there was about it .
i was really really happy for her when she won the match was very well worked to get you behind her as well .
it was n't phenomenal because of a couple of botches especially the top rope ones and a few moments of weird pacing but it was still a great match .
i feel like most of what went wrong was mostly on coffey he 's very good and gave it his all in this match i have tremendous respect for his performance but he is n't an elite level wrestler in my opinion .
the man who showed up afterwards though that 's as elite as it gets .
i 'm torn on the future of these two on one hand i want dunne 's reign to go on for as long as it can on the other i do n't want to see walter lose his first high profile match in nxt at all .
i guess i 'll be rooting for walter when they face off .
but i expect an absolute clinic even better than the one we got here with coffey .
awesome show will definitely be watching the product more frequently as i expected this show would make me do .
the article makes it sound as though we will no longer have bananas .
but really we will no longer have the cavendish banana which is indeed a shame but not the end of all bananas .

no deal is what happens if the brexit negotiations fail .
it 's as much of an option for leaving the eu as homelessness is if you 're having trouble with your mortgage .
and we were told or threatened very clearly that would be implemented regardless of the consequences .
if they 've got a better option on how to leave in a way that 's less damaging i 'm sure we 're all willing to hear them out .
they 've got to hold their noses and push through with what they 've been tasked with and that 's leaving .
their primary duty is to act in the best interests of the country and allowing a no deal scenario to occur is very much the opposite of that .

i 'm a marvel strike force player and am not into comic books or watching any of the movies .
i have seen the original superman movies with christopher reeves tim burton batman the first toby maguire spider-man and the batman movie with heath ledger .
i came across marvel strike force because my real life friends play it and what drew me to it were the slick graphics animations and music .
i then sought out other similar games and came across star wars galaxy of heroes and dc legends both games suffer in my very humble opinion from the same problems .
the graphic animations are very very boring the music is very boring and in dc legends case the matches seem as if they take forever .
i do enjoy playing the game but can only play a few minutes at a time because it really is a snooze fest .
what makes this even worse is that her work required her to be exposed to a lot of x-rays and she died due to cancer she died because of her work .
other members of her family have died of cancer and the incidence of gynaecological cancer is known to be disproportionately high among ashkenazi jews
many families have some history of cancer at least in the tumor stage because the older you are the more likely you are going to get it https zniup3zx6m0ydqfpv9y6sgtf-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rf-age_rgb_web_v02_0.png .
so that first point does n't mean that much .
i will say however that the second point about ashkenazi jews is true but given what we know about x-rays and regular exposure see marie curie https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie death her age franklin was 37 when she died it 's like saying a man 's family history is the reason why he got lung cancer and not that fact that he smoked 3 packs a day .
to answer questions which might become popular therefore increasing my imaginary internet points if my comment also gains traction .
there are a couple of cards that jump out as either having very few other cards to synergise with or that will suffer from having no lands in the main deck danitha empty the warrens thopter spy network and glowspore shaman .
i think it needs a little more curation in terms of themes as well as curve balance .
having a shared library opens up an interesting new element to the game which can be a lot of fun to play with cards that manipulate the top of the library now affect all players so things like reclaim and memory lapse now have a whole new dimension .
a guaranteed land per turn in addition to your regular hand/draws is going to be kind of like drawing two cards per turn but where curving well is very relevant .
going this route i would expect x '' spells and efficient mana sinks to be more powerful than usual .
i 've previously built a cubelet which is a similar concept shared library once per their turn a card from their hand can be played face down as a rainbow land .
i found it to be a pretty good mana solution what about that method was n't working out for you ?
how many posts are you going to comment this same phrase to ?
as a ig user you have easy access to the tail .
i am amazed on behemoth how a tail can stay up for so long despite there being 3 cutters on a team and yet i can easily do it by myself with a lance in a single phase .
but no most ig users would rather vault around like idiots attacking no particular parts and be the worst group of players in all of world have the stats to back that up .
now if i can just get my paper bag flair all will be well .
as if anytime someone wants to debate it 's a bad thing .

we needed who we recruited in the summer to fill out the squad .
this window we have no more room for wage growth due to ffp and this is the reason i think emery is not so keen on ozil .
i think he looks at ozil 's wages and thinks theres two very good players waiting to be paid that money .

there are a great many mysterious injuries that get misdiagnosed as spider bites just because people are n't sure what else it could have been .
because you specified that there was pus it sounds more like an infection of some sort .

to add to this a floating currency means that the exchange rate is determined in the market through supply and demand .
with a fiat currency the default mechanism of institutional control will be the interest rate which we will be set by the central bank .
since the central bank will always set an interest rate based on monetary objectives i.e .
fighting inflation there will always be some government influence in the market .
so even without other intervention measures there would n't be a truly market determined exchange rate free of government influence .

and seriously people who act like our defense has been bad this whole season when people like jaylon and lve were key in our success several times this season make it that much harder for me to take seriously when they go and defend dak .
our defense has been consistently good which is more than i can say for the qb that saw the first blowout the cowboys had in 15 years .

one thing that helped me realize what 's real again is being able to rationalize all of this .
do n't rationalize bullshit that no one else can see .
do n't entertain thoughts that are only making you feel worse .
these are all philosophical questions that people do ask themselves but people with psychosis take too literally .
i once found a quote that said 'if one person believes in a god they are crazy .
if a bunch of people believe in god it 's called a religion . '
i personally found that helpful as it modified my understanding of what 'god ' could really be .
you are praying to yourself you are always watching yourself .
'' only god can judge you '' means that only you can judge yourself .
most people who believe in god adjust their religion to suit their lifestyle .
if you were a god with no powers you would just continue living a normal life like everyone else right ?
even if everything is programmed it makes sense mathematically that biology is .
even normal people know this to some extent but they do n't focus on it nor spend much time thinking about it .
they are n't having long conversations with their innerself .
do you feel like the tv is talking to you the radio ?
like everything is catered to you and giving you secret messages ?
either ways that weird feeling sounds like a new episode is starting .
take your medication or up the dosage if you are already taking it .
sleep more watch mindless things like the big bang theory etc that wo n't over stimulate you .
hopefully over time those thoughts will calm down to a more rational way of thinking .
the difference between normal people who entertain these thoughts and us .
is that they are trying to learn while we are trying to force a belief in our minds .
there is a big difference between thinking outside the box and staying outside the box .

oh okay that makes more sense thanks for the info
stopped playing for over a week and decided to test out toons in the new meta .
i noticed less people are running spell anti back row cards and are mostly running effect .
so i decided to make a similar build to the last time i got kog which had a similar meta sylvans by running mostly effect negation .
at first i was running pathfinder and cursed seal and void trap hole .
however i found i was bricking too much and was n't coming against many cc or gc .
i switched to relink and econ and demise of the land .
relink lets you draw 1 which is always important in toons as they are resource heavy and also protects your cards if tk is banished by a wild cc .
econ gives you protection and can be used to take their monsters draw get protection .
usually i would econ take a monster like dunker and tribute or go for game if possible .
demise worked almost every game due to how many decks special summon .
it works wonders for monsters like spirit who banish on summon .
as most of the time they 'll banish demise only for it chain and bring tk on the board .
it not only lets monsters like summoned skull elf mermaid attack first turn but it also negates your opponents effects it gives you an attack boost in the occasions when you need to not get hit over or need to reduce the lp reduction and it stops your toons from being destroyed if tk is destroyed .
there is no replacement for this card and should 100 be run at 3x .
imo econ is better just because of relinkuriboh but canadia is just as good or debatably better .
not only will it stop effects from triggering as most do n't activate on summon but also always for possible tribute fodder .
however i would n't run it ahead of memory loss as memory loss counters all effects except celestial which is limited
divine wrath is the next best thing if you do n't have memory loss .
however toons are resource heavy that 's why i use relinkuriboh over pathfinder and divine wrath is too costly to be better than memory loss for now .
maybe when we get more support divine wrath will be better .
because i run a lot of spells in this deck cursed seal is easy to activate .
however i did n't get the chance to activate much because of the current meta .
if the meta shifts to more spell backrow removal this card will be amazing .
it works well with extra demise of the land .
another thing to point out are cc and gc .
if tk is banished your monsters will not be destroyed .
you will only lose the tk protection but you can still attack directly then you have potential relinkuriboh econ chalice which can all be used defensively in protecting your toons .
however galaxy cyclone is very difficult to come back from .
but because it needs 2 turns to hit tk you can kill them with tdmg before they have the chance .
i got to legend 3 easily but getting 5 wins in a row for kog took about 40 games .
koaki meiru not a bad match up if you can negate maximus .
usually after you negate him they run out of steam or tdmg kills them .
sometimes i econ take maximus with spare fodder to suicide it .
silent swordsman easy if you go first and put tk down .
extremely difficult if you go second and he has silent swordsman already out .
usually they make it easy to kill them fast .
blue eyes they can be extremely difficult because of the bouncing and revives .
spirit ca n't get over toon skull plus you have relink econ protection .
luckily they run very little backrow so even with tk banished you can kill them .
banish control if they run anti back row cards like cc or gc it 's gg .
but usually i relied on mermaid as it ca n't be banished by assailant .
it 's possible to win chalice econ take to tribute to tdmg and they die before they get another spellcaster .
tbh i did n't play so many meta decks .
or decks not constructed well like a koaki deck with 2 diamonds .
it can be good bait for destruction if you have n't already set up board .
and gives you a chance to still win if you ca n't get tk .
her ability to take down the opponents life points first turn she is summoned is great .
even with tk destroyed i 've found myself winning just with her and toon world .
unlike myself she 's not a fan of cum .
she does n't like the temp mainly says it feels weird which i can respect .
i love it i 'm bi we both are but its not for everyone .

i hate it when people try and compare downtown chicago/the loop to downtown toronto .
it is not dumb as fuck but shows that the person making the comparison does n't know jack shit about the differences between the two downtowns '' .
the downtown chicago area is not just made up of the loop and the magnificent mile .
those four neighbourhoods are the loop chinatown gold coast magnificent mile river north south loop and streeterville .
i find it odd that you are comparing 2/7 neighbourhoods within downtown chicago to the entirity of downtown toronto ?
that seems like you really tryna be super disingenious and throw out some nice spin or you simply did n't bother to look at what downtown chicago really is .
whatever tho since you only brought up the loop and magmile '' which i would n't even call a neighbourhood cause it is just a part of a street and nothing else let us compare the area and population of the loop and magmile .
the loop is 4.09 km¬≥ with a population of 33,442 people according to the 2015 census .
mag mile is a 13 block 1 mile/1.61 km section of michigan avenue ca n't find any population numbers but it is probably quuuuuuuite a bit lower than the loop due to the magmile being made up of mostly retail restaurants museums and hotels .
downtown toronto on the other hand is 14 km¬≥ 3.5 times the size of the loop and the population is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much higher as well .
just ward 13 toronto centre has a population of 103,805 2016 census with an area of 5.67 km¬≤ based on my super rough look at it on daftlogic .
to make a comparison between downtown toronto and 2/7 parts of downtown chicago without taking into account area and population is super shaky .
another part of that comparison that is dumb is that the loop and magmile are known for being super high scale '' upperclass business districts .
the same is not true for all of downtown toronto .
there are at risk neighbourhoods in downtown toronto that do not exist in the loop and magmile such as regent park moss park alexandra park/atkinson/po and bleecker .
comparing two parts of downtown chicago that are middle and upper class commercial financial districts to an entire downtown core with a mix of different neighourhoods with different makeups apples to oranges comparison my guy .
the only difference between these two will be design and i think misfit has their own activity tracking app .
other than that they are identical on the inside .
they are both made by fossil so the venture hr the falster 2 and the vapor 2 will be pretty much the same just different designs .
i personally like the design of the falster 2 the best .

if you have the opportunity of initializating a struct you can do 0
this certainly saves you some characters in your code but it wo n't save you any instructions the array still has to be filled with zeroes at runtime whether you do it explicitly or implicitly in your program !

assuming i remember the statistics correctly i-75 is the 5th highest stretch of road for deadly accidents from georgetown to richmond .
a very broad range of speed typically 60 to 80 mph with about 1 in 10 doing 90 .
a lot of exits that leave most traffic unable to get up to speed or drivers unaware of their vehicles needed runway to get up to speed .
the omg traffic i have to slow down '' then wonder why they ca n't merge and neither can the five cars behind them suddenly tail gating them .
i-75 lets you pretty much go on auto pilot because a lot of people are traveling through the area .
mix that with people quickly navigating their way to the next exit and three lanes wide just does n't leave much room to navigate .
people zoned out and squatting in the fast lane '' which really needs to be a hov lane instead .
the i-75 and i-64 mergers pretty much makes this area around lexington a real nightmare of too much traffic with too few options to reliably navigate what lanes you need to be in versus several of the above issues .

yes although if you start a mission while there 's a crafting queue it 'll forget about the things it was crafting and you 'll have to redo them queued up 20 gas traps in the armory and started a mission and when i checked my inventory i had 2 and my queue was empty
br has a fraction of the content fortnite does .
the downside to that is that there can be bugs sometimes .
i guess a recent example is that people were stupidly overleveling their weapons so they could n't make them anymore so epic made it so that we could craft lower level versions of our weapons .
in making that update one of the weapons now fires shovel and grenade models instead of bullets when you craft it down .
usually just silly shit like that although there 's been a couple of ‚Äòserious ' bugs but they 've always been sorted out fairly quick without worry .

i highlighted in red where the google summary got its sentences from the website and in yellow how it actually states that you should receive the flu vaccine during pregnancy .
the first google snippet is suggesting that the flu vaccine is bad and causes a list of complications but when i actually clicked on the websites link it stated the exact opposite that the flu vaccine is important to help prevent the flu and it 's serious complications .
i just thought it was interesting how google just seemed to pick a few sentences and put them together which made it seem like the website was stating that flu vaccines were bad .
it also interests me that this was the first thing to pop up even though it was n't really relevant to my search .

the thing i figured out to fix it was maybe an app glitch .
i ended up switching from juicer mode to rider map and back to juicer and it updated the map for me .
that made those uncapturable limes go off the map .

most of my friends insurance is between 800 1000/mo since their jobs do n't offer it .

this is really bad advice and a great way to make resource guarding worse .

there are many plug and play units that will do more damage and be more useful from 100 hp to 0 hp than sez .
his damage is super subpar compaired to a lorina or clarissa who does more dmg and more utility with the same gear and jokers .
people try to justify him due to start of game rerolling .
they are good to carry through early game and easy content .
once enemies have high hp and defense ... not so much ... there are better units that can be helpful 100 of the fight ... not 50 of the fight .
yes but next year fuji is also releasing a 100mp ibis camera medium format so it 's likely these two will often be compared .
and if the canon has a smaller sensor and lenses not designed for such high resolution fuji gfx lenses are then it 's going to be hard for canon to compete unless it 's a 2800 or less camera
whales drive the price up or down when they sell or buy but in doing so they 're also running risks as btc can surge or crash resulting in them having sold low or bought high and lost money .
hodlers are not whales the more btc is being held and not used the less btc in circulation there will be at any given moment .
this is helpful in driving prices up by basic supply vs demand logic although that wo n't necessarily happen as there are more factors to it than just that obviously .
i think about shooting terminators in the future war .
it was the sideshow/takeover guys shooting fireworks at the police helicopter .
another time they blocked hollywood blvd did their donuts .
once police arrived someone threw a firework towards an officer it exploded near the officer .
they will block police cars to let the people doing donuts get away .
they just had a meet at a long beach towne center near my house .
i heard a few doing donuts at an intersection around midnight next to apartments .
i checked their social media sure enough they were at the shopping center .
a few minutes later i hear the helicopter flyover so they can break up the 200 cars .
they had a huuuge meet at an anaheim shopping center .
you 'll can see all their derogatory comments towards our officers .
most of the cars doing it are stock beaters and trucks .
you ca n't even find a decent meet anymore without some idiot revving as they arrive or leave .
the southern california car scene is extremely burnt right now .
officers used to i read up on one meet the other day where an officer hung out with everyone go to meets to make sure there 's no funny business they 'd hang out and are so cool .
plenty of officers are car enthusiasts right now they do n't have a choice but to blanket everyone with enforcement .
it 's always the degenerates running it for everyone .
why would you block active roadways and block officers ? ! ?
i 'm very confident that this was just a guess and is wrong .

i 'm honestly not sure what you 're arguing here .
it seems like you 're just taking three logical steps backwards .
you agree that sex ed and birth control fewer abortions .
you also agree that the religious people are n't going to back down .
so how have you not concluded that the only way forward is to not back down either say fuck the idiots and pursue a science and evidence based society without their approval ?
that was a surprising amount of effort for a joke !

not every one of the millions of comments on reddit has to be a profoundly unique idea .

these things get upvoted by people who have n't been here as long as or do n't frequent reddit as much as you

i know that lower frames exhibit more noise and traditionally larger time frames are therefore easier to predict since the signals are more clear .

the thing is i 've dealt with your behavior enough to conclude that you not everyone but specifically you are almost guaranteed to dismiss any dissent with insults name calling dismissive rhetoric .
i am attempting to honestly tell you specifically what behaviors debate tactics i regularly see you engage in with myself other subscribers on this sub that i find distasteful disagreeable and you wo n't recognize or acknowledge that any of them may potentially have merit .
instead you double down on your position attack insult me in an attempt to validate your initial opinion response to my dissent while completely dismissing any of my responses by refusing to even acknowledge my criticisms let alone consider them h even address them with a reasonable rebuttal .
i have quite literally found you impossible to effectively or respectfully communicate with so i 'm done trying as i see no reason to try continue .
no doubt you 'll respond again with insults criticisms in an attempt to prove your original points that i 'm a hypocrite '' r/utahjazz kool-aid drinker that 's incapable of keepin ' it real like you and i 'm fine with that .

nah captain america doesnt need to be a comedic character either neither does daredevil neither does any other serious character .
furthermore it would at least be alright if they would have at least given thor a logical reason to be this way .
he just suddenly is extremely comedic from the start of the movie onwards without any explanation on why .
they could have done it easily by having him cope with loss of asgard his friends his father etc .
by facading his sadness with humor but no he is already way too comedic for his pre-ragnarok self before even anything bad happens and he stays on the same level of comic relief for the entirety of the film .

also that superbowl loss to the steelers ... ouch .
coyotes are always projected to have a better season and then shit the bed and get riddled with injuries the past 7 years
the cards wasted fitzgeralds career the suns wasted a good portion of nashs career the coyotes wasted doans entire career and the dbacks wasted the past 8 years or whatever of goldschmits career .

i think trolling you should be quite obvious i mean you 're dumb enough to think that aim assist actually does anything to bloom .
little tip for next time you want to lord your intelligence over people try do a little research on the topic instead of on buzzwords and formatting that make your paragraph look intelligence until you read it .
i know what you said and it 's completely wrong because aim assist helps with tracking an opponent whereas bloom is the rng on where a bullet will go in your crosshairs spread .
aim assist does n't touch how your crosshairs spreads .
in short do some fucking research or you 'll look as stupid as your appear now .

do you think that trump is really for an inclusive version of american nationalism though ?
seems like he has a massive white nationalist base and a bad track record with people of color .
he fought to make sure hard promises was n't released at 9.98 above the normal 8.98 that was the price at the time for records .
there are many other things like this as well that he fought for .
that along with his music is what makes him my favorite artist of all time .
i think whoever is in charge of all of this now needs to stand back and realize what they are doing and that he probably would not appreciate most of it .
and do n't forget that he 's a fantastic anti-shield hero that can shred them down with his e ability .
edit oh i forgot that his ult is the only damaging ult that can go through walls be activated from spawn and travels indefinitely .
it would be difficult to summon their weapons since they form from their gem .

i guess it because i focus a lot of time and energy on staying sober .

one of my fears when i got sober was how boring life would be and like ... no .
it is boring to waste your life getting drunk and doing stupid shit every night .
for real the only reason souls games did n't have a pause button was because of the constant online element going on allowing players to pause at certain moments then taking that away when a online interaction happened would only be more confusing to newbies than those games already are

decent vice i have had danica danvice and after 1000 flies it still works like a charm
two bobbins it 's much more fun to tie when you do n't need to change thread every once in a while
2 scissors one with pointy head for small flies and one with serrated blade for hairs
start with 2 different colour threads black and white is my suggestion .
black is soft of fits for all '' thread colour and white can be coloured with sharpie .
for materials look up for patterns you would be mostly tying and then invest on decent not pro grade silver or gold materials .
at the beginning one does n't need to have every colour of dubbing or 3-5 different dubbing materials in different colours .
hares ear seal synthetic dubbing with basic colours black olive red will work in most cases and those can be mixed .
black olive and grizzly capes or hen necks and natural pheasant will work on tens if not hundreds fly patterns .
so my point is choose wisely less is more and if you got fly tying fewer that stays on then invest on better high grade materials .
i made that mistake that i overpurchased materials and later on was forced to sell bucketloads of obsolet dubbing/hair/feather/tinsel packets

i walk all around my house with shoes on and sometimes keep them on until i 'm getting ready for bed .
admittedly my habit is not super common but it 's also common to not take them off at the door here .
a lot of people i know will take them off after being home for just a little bit or sometimes right after they get back but they often store them somewhere in the house that is n't right at the door and walk there first .
plus most people i know never remove their shoes if they 're over at a friend 's house .
the dog thing is something i 've actually never heard of people doing i do n't think .

how high off the ground should the mono tubs be ?
i 'm planning on building shelves to hold them all .
but was wondering can i get away with having them on the floor or should i put them on a table ?
once the shelves are built what 's the best height from the floor ?
the reason i ask is i have heard some say contamination lives closer to floor level .
i 'm planning on having an entire bedroom devoted to my tubs .
any ideas on best way to store a bunch grain bags that are colonizing ?
the walls and ceiling are covered in mylar and the floor is heavy black plastic over the hardwood .
it used to be my bloom room but i 'm switching gears now in the flooded green market .
the ss are mostly conservatives which is why so many people got across the white house lawn when obama was in office .

yea dude they got ta nerf that i thought they said the grant no competitive advantages
wow this explains even more stuff all across the board literally lol .
you see i figured it came down to the back side of the board .
i guess it really does that but i also thought the sensor was there for the hot spot .
but it makes logical sense for it to be at the very center of everything in the middle .
this supports and demands a lot of good thermal paste .
i will add that i am running liquid metal and got a proper die and core .
so i guess filling up most of the gpu space and die with far too much paste in this case would allow more heat to escape from the card .
still though in thermal cameras the backside is fairly hot .
i am inclined to think that light air flow there would assist a bit .

i mean you say that but in this same thread people keep saying the wheel and western civilization was made on the backs of white europeans without whom we would be in the stone age because all the other races suck .
i think people use these kind of vague studies vague because we still do n't know what percent the genetics even matter to iq do n't attract the right people and are n't even that important for science as a whole .
potential pattern recognition at a young age does n't seem to be helping us discover things about the human gene more than it is fueling people from placing themselves above others and reinforcing that with violence .

but if you think about it surely there 's reason you 've played through it 3 times .
blood storm into grasp of the starved in late game is pure bullshit .
i do n't know why you were only dealing 1.2k but if you get the right combo off it should be 7k damage to an entire field of enemies in one turn .
apotheosis blood sacrifice inner demon blood storm adrenaline grasp of the starved skin graft grasp of the starved
on standard you can get the same combo off but with one less grasp of the starved .
not to mention you 're healing for the damage you deal making you by far the tankiest mage class .
if you 're just playing necro like you play any other mage class where you cast spells and do damage then you wo n't get the full potential .
you have to play around the fact that you get 1 ap cost from standing in blood and that grasp only works when the enemy is standing in blood and craft combos around that .

firstly that is an overly dramatic way of disagreeing not a respectful '' way .
that aside even with all the work put in it its my opinion that they should go with something that has a larger user base so it has more support .
heck we might be in luck from my perspective i am not a fan of star citizen but it turns out they are doing all the modifications to make cry engine be able to do double-precision floating-point which is a big boon to flight sims from what i gather .
hopefully this will lead the way in more game engines being more of an out of the box solution for high fidelity sim creation .
making more competition and also allowing more developers to create great sims with out having to learn a closed ecosystem used by one company .
also its not about getting the game engine and modifying it and sticking with that forever you want to modify it in ways that support other games and backport the changes in to the next version of the game engine .
help cry/unity/unreal update their physics and what not which can benefit most games in ways .
did you read my ksp comparison or stop at the word ksp ?
i did n't compare the flight model hell i did n't even compare ksp to dcs at all ... all i did was give ksp as an example of things a game engine can do .
edit this is just what i '' would want to do as per op question its not what i am recommend that dcs does ...
edit2 and before ksp came out i never would of figured any of the current game engines could do what it does .
oh.. would you look at that guess i was right .
i do n't even offend them when they hold on to the last building .
there was a z today who did that building hatcheries in every corner even after obviously being beaten .

hi i second all the posts saying you should take free online classes .
if you do end up going the coding bootcamp route which is n't completely necessary and totally dependent on you/how you learn/your work ethic/etc .
i would highly recommend you look into the fullstack academy nyc tech talent pipeline wdf program .
full disclaimer i did go to fullstack but i was n't a part of this program i 'm not a nyc resident and i 'm currently working in ca .
the bootcamp is free for nyc residents as long as they commit to finding a job in nyc after they graduate .
i was n't a part of this program so i 'm going to end up paying the full 17k ' i did meet a lot of wdf students and they were genuinely some of the smartest hard working people i met at fullstack .
best of luck with whatever you decide to do !
palpatine through dooku was responsible for the attempt on padme‚Äòs life .
he also suggested obi-wan and anakin be the ones to protect her .

i would n't be surprised if palpatine was dex 's landlord .

whether dooku was up to speed on the plan to that point i do n't know .

so from the side or the back is best .
i use my ipad and a sports app for drawing on video and it lets me see what i 'm doing in slow motion and it lets me draw reference points .
what i try to get across is that you need to zoom out and see the whole body 's position motion and attitude but that 's not actually what i teach .
i teach switching back and forth from focusing out to focusing in .
most people here and most vocal advice gets you to focus in so i just push in the one direction .

the lead recruiter at my contracting company called me and asked so many pervasive questions .
why did n't you tell me you were job hunting ?
she said it was unprofessional '' to take so much pto and the managers were concerned i was taking pto instead of asking .
she only makes unscheduled calls which i suspect is so her comments ca n't be recorded .

i 'm a moderate conservative and i use this as an argument as to why i 'm a moderate who leans conservative .
i believe every woman should have choice and abortion if done properly can help but as somebody who has an infant niece and one who is going to be born in a few weeks i feel that after the first trimester or after it 's a fetus it 's murder and unless it was going to kill me or it was ectopic i would never go through with it even if i was raped or had to put my life on hold or take a second job .
babies are usually seen as these life enders but they 're more like speed bumps and you can either choose to have your car flip over and burn you to death or drive into the night .
personally i also feel this goes back to me and why i would n't get an abortion unless it was a last resort .
my mom had me a few months after high school so i knew that there were probably one or two people who called her a whore or saw me as a bastard whose dad skipped town .
but i found out recently that she was horrified when she found out and was going to abort me because she was horrified as to what my grandma would say .
she only told my aunt and her neighbor my uncles sister .
she was obviously disappointed but she did come from a generation where that was common her own mom dropped out at 17 to marry and raise a family and my mom could also get a job because she had a diploma .
years later nobody regrets that they did n't go through with it .
let 's just say that the episode of rick and morty where they watch cable is harder to watch now .
this is usually what i try to tell people .

nobody who might be willing to vote for her gave a shit about it .
when trump made it an issue she responded with evidence pr treated it seriously and gave it a serious rebuttal .
it made her a laughingstock on all sides i 'm still embarrassed for her .
gets accused by a right winger of lying about her background because she grew up in an average home in an average neighborhood .
again nobody gives a shit about this except right wingers .
and right wingers do n't actually care they 're just shit-slingers .
she does n't take it more seriously than two tweets .
her response is simple tells a few minor facts about herself throws in a quick shoutout to the social mobility argument the line about zipcodes .
then she takes the opportunity to shit-talk a bit .
she does n't call up an economist to write a report analyzing the median income cost of living purchasing power of her zipcode to provide proof that she really grew up middle-class .
she does n't ask her childhood friends to give interviews with reporters to provide secondhand stories of growing up poor together .
it does n't stick to her because it was a non-issue to begin with brought up by bad-faith actors as an attack rather than as a genuine concern and her response is short simple does n't take it seriously and pushes her values .

i think the shutdown and his inability to negotiate for the end of the shutdown just demonstrates clearly that he is either the most incompetent president in our country 's history or he is taking direct orders from putin 's government to exacerbate this shutdown for their political gains .

they have a very splotchy record when it comes to adapting villians .
half the villains in the movies are weird amalgamations of several different comic characters yellowjacket hela to name a few and the rest are severely altered variations of the original villains .
thanos and ultron are my favorite villains but the movie versions were nothing like their comic counterparts .
i fully trust them to capture the spirit of the heroes and faithfully adapt those characters while keeping true to the source material but they have n't shown they can/will do that with villains at all .
it 's in my previous post right by the text of the rosenstein memo recommending comey be fired and next to the link to the ig report saying comey was insubordinate as well as leaking information and lying about it .
lots of info shows that comey was dirty and deserved to be fired but you selectively ignore the parts that tell the story in favor of ten seconds of video taken out of context .
if the whole video is considered it 's a list of reasons not just one as you so dishonesty imply .
see the part where comey told the president in private on three separate occasions that he was not the target of an investigation even while the president explained about the negative cloud over his administration due to the media pushing the idea that he was is part of the dirty shit comey did .
why not tell the public he was n't being investigated ?
because it harmed his image it was intentional much like telling potus that he had this dossier with hookers pissing on him that was intended to cause pressure and right after that the media really picked up the story of the dossier a series of documents that comey would later testify were salacious and unverified yet he shared this with potus in an almost blackmail way .
that 's why comey was fired he was dirty as fuck .
like the two dozen other officials at the top of the fbi/doj who were fired or demoted or quit .

yes the script can remain a bit problematic for some time .
rereading and copying the same text s over and over is probably sound advice roth li says so if i remember well .
of course the more vocabulary you know the easier it becomes to read words quickly
i learnt the script as an alphabet so i can at least vouch for the efficiency of this approach to me the syllabic approach and its hundreds of syllables seems to make things more complex than need be .
still i can see that some would prefer it since it highlights the combination of letters .
maybe try to stick to one approach for some time and see of it works for you ?

i think your only hope tho might be a cds or at a inline banks but even then i think much better than 2 would be hard to find .
there are better places or way to stash some money and make better than 2
i swear to god this response is the dumbest most infuriating thing i see .
my vegan girlfriend uses it all the time and it 's maddening .
anytime someone has conflicting views with her regarding using animal products no matter what they say it 's oh you 're getting riled up and upset because you know i 'm right you 're just guilty and trying to justify your terrible actions . ''
fucking no stacey they are n't they 're upset because you 're all up in their shit with your preachy nonsense .
just because someone ca n't take the time to worry about every single little fucking problem in the world does n't mean they know they 're doing wrong and trying so hard to justify it so they do n't seem like a piece of shit . ''
i can not stand when people think offering an explanation is just them trying to justify their behavior as if they need to .
edit on the flip side yeah i 'm aware some people do try to use excuses and justifications .
well yeah uh um well you do n't care about starving kids in africa '' etc .
you do n't need to make excuses or justify anything .

you specifically said they could just dig the dirt up with their hands. i 'm against it for many reasons .
two bigs ones are 1 no other mammal or animal or anything buried their dead like humans .
i think it would be more likely they eat their dead than bury them because some animals do eat each other ie momma bear eating cubs 2 the earth has layers .
it 's not just soft sand for 10 feet .
if they buried their dead they would need a big ass hole .
when you get to deeper layers the layers become harder and clay like until it eventually reaches a layer where water does not break it down meaning it would be hard stone .
good luck breaking up hard stone with your hands .

extra credit stop clowning around and discuss the topic of the thread instead of name calling .
i wo n't call you names either way but you may earn an iota of respect .
you really missed that discussing the topic of the thread '' was the entire point and theme of my original comment ?
how does shifting discussion over to criticizing the left '' as was your aim achieve that exactly ?
i got ta hand it to you you 're sinking a lot of effort into defending a trump supporting troll .
it 's not easy to completely miss this many points from multiple people .
you 're so focused on attacking me over name calling '' that apparently only you can see as is even pointed out by other users that you 're providing one hell of an example of ca n't see the forest for the trees '' .
you seem willfully ignorant to the breadth of meaning that can exist in the english language .
you 're using song lyrics to show/insult me '' in some bizarre act of hubris .
somehow you think that pop-culture references give you a win ?
you have n't caught onto a single point that myself or others have lobbed your way and you still think there 's something to be won here when literally no one has commented in support of your side '' .
i 'm not the one worried about an iota of respect '' judging by the albeit limited reaction from other users .
i 'm responding because this has gotten coincidentally hilarious .
you 've actually brought up a mis-labeled reference to the cochran-mantel-haenszel test !
wtf were you trying to achieve with that reference ?
using big words in an attempt to sound smarter so the name-caller '' online would stop warning people to not waste their time with trump supporting dummies ?
i really want to know how you think that particular test is relevant !
do you even know if that test is still commonly used these days or were you throwing out some vocab you remember from an undergrad course ?
i 'm also pretty confident that i 'm distantly related to william cochran not that it 's relevant and i 'd have to double-check hence my hilarity .
go ahead and explain the statistical reasoning you 're employing .
use as high a level vocabulary as you want i assure you i 'll know if you 're making sense .
if your above responses are any indication you 'll succeed in sounding like you 're in way past your ability in some sort of dunning-krueger on steroids spoiler you are .
for the record i 'm down-grading you to white-knights for alt-right trolls '' .
edit believe it or not i tried to be nicer .
i 've read your other posts and comments and still ca n't figure out why you think you 're doing anything useful here .
i does n't seem like you 're normally quite this dense .
i think i 'd have a check of a night and watch sportcenter tomorrow

i liked pike though so not going to complain about that plot .
i despised clarke for the entire season octavia was odd feeling but i get her reasons indra did n't strike me as indra at all and do n't even get me started on clarke 's mother .

i was in the market for an electric vape .
i wanted one that i could use through a bubbler not super expensive but with a decent capacity .
i was looking at some vape review videos on youtube and came across one https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=javkxm-kbka has_verified=1
the cf was one reviewed here that fit my budget and my needs .
when i first got it i was not happy .
stock airflow sucked but a little research fixed the problem removed stock screen and started using the dosing capsules for the cloud evo .
i sacrificed some bowl capacity but i still get two sessions out of one cartridge .
i 'd only used an m before so was not used to the slower vapour production of a session vape such as the cf .
the high kind of sneaks up on you instead of hitting you between the eyes like the m. i get just as high eventually but it is a different experience .
it is excellent through a bubbler even at the highest heat setting .
i only use high heat for the bubbler but tone it down to 375 direct .
i only use a vape at home and mostly in the afternoon or evening so while the cf is reasonably stealthy that was n't really a consideration .
neither was having a large battery capacity for group sessions .
the battery lasts maybe 3 sessions and are not removable .
i 'll be happy with a replacement instead of a refund .
i did n't know it was legal to forgo the stick .
i 'll hack it down later if it ends up being too lengthy .
i 've realized that i can sort of tolerate colton when he 's interacting one on one with the women .
something about him in a group setting is turning me off though .
what about those of us who were n't able to but have either taught themselves or had the botox injection ?
do we answer like we would have before or should we not take the survey ?
i 've known people who kinda match this discription pretty well .
as much of a shitty situation it is it 's not fair that they put responsibility on their friends when they 're responsible for their own mental health .
i 've found that it 's never a good idea to feed their pursuit of attention it always ends with going down a rabbit hole that nobody likes to be in .
the only thing that i 've found works to deal with these kind of people is to either distance yourself as you 've been doing or plainly admit to them that you 're not a psychologist and if they want to get better they need to take responsibility and make strides to get better on their own volition

there is a reason houston downtown has a underground tunnel system with stores and restaurants .

when i missed jtr 's 3rd event by a week i spent the next 6 weeks saving up her gear and zetas .
when i got her she went straight to g12 with 2 zetas .
i 'll be doing the same for revan and highly recommend you do the same .
knowing the timetable helps for this though so you know you have time to replace a stun gun or 2 .
you wo n't miss out on anything before level 35 .
the only advantage you could possibly give yourself before then would be if you bought either of the expansions as these would allow you to create a character of the au'ra race .

ildis being made to put his hand in the sauce was living people being cruel to other living people and i think in general that 's always more brutal .
but the reason he made himself ceo of tesla is that it was being managed into bankruptcy no offense to the firm 's two visionary founders they were just unprepared for the job .
they thought they could oem everything and just slap it all together into a car easy peasy .
as elon put it at the time he had invested 70 million in tesla so he needed to have both hands on the wheel .
it 's most likely dependent on the state so there might be some where it 's illegal for that reason i would n't doubt it

why would we believe that him copying shows that he does n't have his own tactical abilities .
that 's why they often start as assistant coaches .
thinking that coaches come up with tactics out of the blue is ridiculous .
you find the tactics that you like and then you try to master it .
it 's only after you have internalized that system that you build your own identity .
it 's not easy to copy a great coach .
it takes lots of skills.fergie honed his skills over a very long time .
you are not going to play like him just by copying the basics .
actually this shows how good a tactician he is because he can copy such a legend .
he is fergie 's pupil so why does anyone expect him to play differently ?
i 've had the exact same experience while trying to finish book 3 .

there is no getting things out of the way '' .
developing a career much like the process of acquiring a college degree is an ongoing never-ending effort that will demand your focus troubleshooting and exploration over and over again on a daily basis until they day you retire or die whichever happens first .
the real money starts coming in a few years into working full time and after a few more years you 'll reach that age where many companies will flip employees over to younger blood to save money and get more productivity.. life is challenging ... there is no 'taking it easy ' ...
based on your post alone it sounds like you are coherent and eloquent enough to pursue and acquire any degree you put your mind and heart into .
the hardest part of college is not necessarily the studies themselves.. it 's often the motivation and schedule and consistence required that causes most college students to drop out ... yes.. more than 50 of students who start college will drop out before getting a degree .
swish it around in your mind and then decide whether you 're ready and willing to hold on a course for at least 4 years .
the more studies and more diplomas and education you get the smaller the pool of competitors you will compete with .
this means higher pay and better quality of life .
that depends on the type of college you go to .
community colleges are different to county and state colleges and different to iv league schools .
you should do something you are interested in ... if this is what interests you then go all the way in and commit to the 4 years .
just.. put your bird on healing stance or tell people to if you see the shouts .

i want to find a girl who loves me as much as you love dion lol
i 'm old so my story was from way back in the summer of 1984 on the campus of iu in bloomington in .
bobby knight was coaching the olympic basketball team that year of course and tryouts were taking place at the hyper on campus could n't get in there though to watch .
bobby cut charles barkley and john stockton kept steve alford though of course as alford played for him at iu .
anyway a friend of mine and i were down there for a bit that summer with his older brother who was going to iu then my friend and i were still in high school though and he was staying on campus that summer in his off-campus apartment so we went down to spend a few days with him on campus that summer .
while we could n't get into the hyper to watch them hoop we along with many others did see them on campus in the huge iu student union while they were relaxing on some of those nights .
i remember seeing mj there in the union but this was before he was the mj of the pros of course as he had n't yet played in the nba his rookie season with the bulls was that coming fall so he 'd not yet hooped in the nba only at n. carolina .
many of the players were hanging out playing billiards bowling and such in the student union there on campus .
now none of these guys were nba players yet as pros did n't yet play for the u.s. olympic team and i get you were asking about encounters with nba players .
well we were able to say hi good luck and things like that to several of them for a few minutes and that was it but all of those dudes became nba players .
you 're right she has n't lost but she seems to be ok with losing .

from then on i 'd always drift away to my daydream whenever i listen to music .
i 've always thought it was normal up until i knew about the term md .
i think what really triggered this was the fact that i was a victim of bullying back in middle school .
i 'd go home feeling extremely sad and daydreaming was a coping mechanism for me .

you can also do it yourself by exporting your deck to a text file and adding the desired cards then importing it back .
it takes a few minutes for transactions to confirm .

trump has made a pretty big deal about wall vs fence so we should really stick to that distinction .
do you have a source for these 15 years of support for a wall explicitly ?
i 've heard of support for a fence or border infrastructure couched in other bills but trump 's wall is essentially pat buchanan 's wall which was laughed at by democrats from the 90s on .

yeah so basically what happens with a pixie is that it shows off whatever face shape you have so theoretically anyone can pull off a pixie as long as they like their face shape good news for you you have what we call an oval face shape which is like the most perfect shape most runway models have to have oval face shapes if you want leave the bangs a little longer at first so you have something to play with then you can always shorten them up like in the picture !

good point about figuring out what technologies my dream job is using .

it does n't stop the force from being this mystical thing
in the ot obi-wan and yoda never bother to check luke 's midichlorians instead they train luke how to tap into the force to feel it in the universe around him how to clear his mind of worldly concerns and attachments in order to experience it on a deeper level .
they do n't care if he 's strong or weak they care that he can open himself up to the force so they train him to resist the dark side and follow the tenants of the jedi order .
we do n't need a scientific explanation as to why they can do this we can just accept okay he 's force sensitive so is leia han ai n't . ''

we have a vendor that we were forced to use on a project that is fast-paced and they dragged their feet getting their product approved .
finally after months of this going back and forth because they were n't paying attention to the details and the owner of the project wanted an update after asking them 5 times on the 6th request i cc 'd in the entire owner group and everyone with the vendor i had an email address for and our managment team and drove the bus right over them .
the owner after getting the email listing the history of negligence of this vendor called them and started a bon fire under them .
they have mildly improved by because they took so long the project could be delayed and i bet they get a nasty-gram for it from the owner .

as i 've always known it a choosing beggar will ask for a very specific version of a generic thing and wont take anything but that and act like it 's almost an insult or an inconvienence if you offer something slightly off their standards .
for example a beggar might ask for a phone for whatever reason .
a choosing beggar is going to ask for a specific model usually high end with certain features they like simply due to their vanity .
in that regard yeah most of these posts are just rude people/normal beggars but every now and then you find a real true blooded choosing beggar .

the frequency of invasions especially by a single player .
a bad teammate that takes it to die instantly or a strong player on the other team that only invades is frustrating to deal with .
a restriction would be nice whether it give you a cooldown upon returning or something .
i 'd also appreciate a visual timer that tells me when the portal is off cooldown i.e .
hit 25 invade hit 50 while still invading returns waiting .
extension of above i 'd probably prefer 80 mote rounds with invasion at 40/80 .

your example of a 14 year old male sex abuse victim is a perfect example of toxic masculinity that pervades society .

toxic masculinity says these boys should be happy they were molested by an older woman .
toxic masculinity says that a boy ca n't be sensitive or vulnerable .

but it does describe the observable statistics of having a higher chance to have education get less years in jail for similar crimes commited by people of color be of higher socioeconomic class and many other things .
now that does not mean that this statistics are a direct cause of a secret conspiracy against people of color the statistics originate from pre-set cultural differences previous wealth that has been inherited past history where whites were favored and geographical issues inner cities with higher crime and lower educational funding .
lastly the white privilege thing is slowly being worked on but the term does describe a real and observable thing as you call it .

200-500 mile trips are more convenient by rail as in europe because of all the impracticalities of air travel .
arriving 90 minutes ahead of time being one of the biggest .
that adds travel time and costs to a flight in order to reach your destination proper .
it would be amazing if a 200 mph train network connected cities like cleveland cincinnati detroit indianapolis louisville chicago milwaukee minneapolis st.louis kansas city etc .
i 'd hop on a train like that on a complete whim sometimes just to go see a baseball game in the summer .
because had it ever been built it would be that convenient and inviting .
people like to go into chicago for a day of shopping .
parking is expensive yet another overlooked aspect and people would love an alternative .
have you ever price checked flights the day of ?
it would cost me 455 to fly to chicago today and back tomorrow .
it 's 190 miles away by car a 3-4 hour drive depending on traffic .
a round trip being about a full tank of gas for most cars plus tolls .
if we had anything similar to europe if the us had been doing anything productive at all in the late 70 's and 80 's i could run to the station board the train buy a ticket from the conductor in transit and get there in about an hour for around 50 .
i 'd walk over to the stuff they were looking at and strike up a conversation .
you are failing to comprehend that your own example '' consists of more than one '' flowchart .
at this point according to the flowchart she ded .
but then the pearl 's teammate iva tasers rook immediately after his space and gives pearl the shield with the knock back and haste and booom
iva 's flowchart is completely omitted as is the subtree of rook 's flowchart that contains his response to the enemy iva .
the outcome of your example '' constitutes the confluence of multiple flowcharts in which its complexity is proportional to how many players are involved within the scene of action .
naturally once after someone gets killed the complexity lessens for the team that outnumbers and expands for the team that is outnumbered and so forth .
no it 's not a '' flowchart unless the environment is strictly controlled to be a 1v1 situation but because you interact with more than one opponent there are subtrees to the flowchart that are intertwined with flowchart of the third fourth fifth and sixth party intervening within the very moment of the gameplay and vice versa for every player involved .

you then knowing she is in a vulnerable situation while staying at your place fucked her keep wanting to fuck her and resent her now she does n't want to fuck you .
if you are actually her friend which i doubt then you will give her a space to stay with you without any opportunity for sex making that clear and sticking to it .
given you realized you just wanted to fuck someone vulnerable you should give her a period of time then ask her to leave two weeks ?

people do n't value healing enough in this game unless you are in like the top 1 of players or have a certain experience with it .
it is n't really a thing other people nessasarally notice happening unless you are the enemy team or you are playing the healer yourself .
i hate the people that dive in all alone die like they should and then complain about healing .
they are n't nessasarally genji players i have seen plenty of other people even tanks do this .
whenever someone complains about needing healing to me i just simply say if you need healing come to me or go find a health pack in the backline .
i am busy trying to keep everyone else healed and you are making my life harder by overextending so much. or something to that effect .

it 's the loneliness and bitterness that kills a long term relationship not usually the event that brings them to confront the situation .
if you dread going home to your so you should make waves immediately .
if you turn your focus onto your relationship and keep it there the way forward will soon become clear .
if your so will work with you and talk from the heart then it will soon become clear whether this story has been told or maybe we both want to write the next chapter .
if your so wo n't talk you 'll need to work it out for yourself .
bear in mind the best predictor of what people will do in the future is what they 've done in the past .

i have an old phone i 'll dig it out .
unlike the facts and experience i have here in the us i could not make that statement about germany or other places in europe .
i only mentioned my experience seeing a metric shitton of long guns sub guns and tactical gear walking around with folks over there .
my rifle only gets to come out in very limited circumstances .
the brass here have for my entire career pushed hard to separate law enforcement from warrior '' or military/militaristic culture for the simple fact that 99.999 of the time we are everything other than warrior .
i 've been both soldier and leo so i know the distinction .
i do feel there is so much untapped potential in fallout universe that could do well with a good spin off .
book 4 is one part of liber aba which is a huge collection of the most important documents in thelema .
it 's not always in print but it 's very worth it .
im far from an expert but it is something like this .
so lets say you earn 4000‚Ç¨ each month which is a high wage .
we do have tax brackets for high earners like that .
so you pay x of tax on your salary up to say 2000‚Ç¨ .
then you pay y of tax on your salary that goes from 2000‚Ç¨ to 3000‚Ç¨ .
then you have a final tax of z of your salary that goes from 3000‚Ç¨ to 4000‚Ç¨ .
then you have the fact that the us system is very inefficent for a lot of reasons .
people dont stay home when they are sick because they cant afford it .
which means that one guy with the flu that goes to work can make everyone in the office sick .
so sure the government saved some money by not paying for that guys sick days and in return they get absolutely no tax money for a week since the whole office got shut down .
or that the whole office productivity goes down because everyone is trying to battle the flu while working at the same time .
a girl might find a lump in her boob but wont see a doctor until two monts later because thats when she has got a health insurance .
so instead of a simple lumpectomy the girl is off work for like a year battling breast cancer .
guess how much taxes she will pay during that time ?
you can be very healthy and still pay for other peoples healthcare .
thats how an insurance works and that is how a government run insurance/universal healthcare works .
it is pretty easy to scam '' the system .
a young person with a great job will most likely not need a health insurance .
so he skips it and only signs up for a health insurance when he is in his forties and when he starts run into health problems due to age .
so he makes some money by doing that but too many people like that and the insurance company has to raise the premium because otherwise they lose money .
and you cant have a profitdriven company losing money .
according to capitalist principles it is all about maximizing profit and the best way of maximizing profit is to collect a lot insurance premiums and try to avoid to pay out anything .
so insurance companies will do their best to do that .
also people with genetic conditions are not profitable for insurance companies so it is in their best interest to make sure they never get an insurance in the first place .
insurance companies are private companies which means they are supposed to make a profit .
and what is stopping insurance companies from maximizing their profits in unethical ways ?
an insurance company hires a lot of people all the way from someone to answer the phones to an insurance adjuster to a ceo .
insurance companies have networks of hospitals that will accept their insurance .
so if you are in a car accident and the ambulance takes your unconscious body to the wrong hospital you are fucked .
hospitals have a billing department to deal with all the insurance companies .
uninsured people treated at hospitals will either disappear or go bankrupt to avoid paying the hospital bills .
im not saying that universal healthcare isnt without problems it has plenty of problems .
but the benefit imho is that it is very efficent because you boot out all of the moneysapping middlemen .
and that means taxes arent that high in the grand scheme of things when you consider what you get for them .
also comparing american taxes to european taxes is a bit unfair since they dont include most social benefits .
a better comparison would be american taxes plus health insurance to european taxes .
another problem is that capitalism tends to hyperfocus on one area and doesnt really give a crap about whats better for the rest of the society .
like the guy giving a whole office the flu instead of just staying home until he feels better and has stopped spreading the flu .
the society as a whole would have saved a lot of money by just letting him stay at home .
also what sorts of food did you eat if you do n't mind me asking ?
do n't worry you 'll be a pro in a week .
the amounts of scans and testing i had when pregnant i 'm gon na say missing that would be a massive fuck up .
unless you 're living in poverty or a hippie weirdo and willingly ignored the need for scans/testing etc .
in australia i believe you can abandon/give away your child but 'anonymous birth ' is illegal .
it 's illegal as it breaches the un mandate that all children have the right to know their parents .
as in if you give birth in a hospital the baby is registered to you and you need to do the paper work to surrender your child to foster care or adoption etc .
also i downvote everything that i do n't agree with .
dunno about you guys but in my case i got overwhelmed very quickly .
not complaining though it 's good to know there 's so many friendly people out there .
on top of that i was going through a nasty breakup .
let 's not be too hasty to judge them thanks friends
i heard so many stories about people who found peace when they became christians .
i tried to hide it from myself even but deep down i felt anger because where the fuck was my peace ? !
i finally found it as a pagan who believes in her own power and loving herself instead of being codependent and waiting for a deity to magically grant what can only be found within .
i think that 's where peace is at for everyone not in any particular religion or faith or philosophy but in being true to your heart .
it 's kind of funny you 'd think that since i still believe in a deity that i 'd feel more comfortable with christians but i do n't .
i feel i have more in common with atheists and agnostics because most of them are more emotionally healthy and have decided to be true to themselves and love themselves .
but i 've gone off on a tangent about where to find real joy and peace .
maybe she needed some liquid courage to follow through on said plans with the bartender ?

the most efficient thing would be for the government to do your taxes for you send you the information about what they did and have you verify it is correct .
but i dont want the government to have that information on me . ''
they already do how do you think they know if you screwed up ? .
the only information they dont already have is from schedule c illegal income .
but i dont want that information sent through the mail so i can sign it . ''
they already send your w-2 through the mail so no new problem there .
but it will cost time/money for government employees to do all that . ''
a the reduction in errors from 10s of millions of amateurs doing it at home will save more time/money than paying seasonal professions to get them done .
b most of it can be automated how many people use software where all they have to do is type in a few numbers into a few boxes ?
this is one of those cases like defense law enforcement healthcare most research letter/package delivery and most infrastructure where more government is the efficient way of getting it done .
blaming the controller for clunky controls is as good an argument as blaming a console for a game having bad optimization .

while it would be nice if leavers tried to please remainers they absolutely do n't need to .
you do n't need the voices of remainers to figure out what kind of brexit you want .
the real problem is that leavers themselves are either massively divided about what they want e.g. open free traders vs closed protectionist nationalists or else they have no defined opinion about the kind of brexit they want the 'just get on with it ' crowd .

honestly the easiest way would be to use retroarch .
it 's a basically all in one emulator so to speak .
the cores are basically emulators for all the different systems out there there are sometimes multiple ones for certain systems .
quick and dirty setup would be to download retroarch .
in the main menu click on online updater and then click on core updater .
scroll down to sony playstation and select the version you want beetle psx hw is the best one just use that .
now all you have to do is go grab the playstation bios from any various source on the internet .
if you do n't know how just google the bios name it should be super easy .
if you load the core and go down to the information section in the main menu of retroarch it 'll tell you what bios files and the names that it needs .
you want to place the bios files in the system‚Äùfolder of the retroarch folder .
then you just have your psx game load up the .cue file from the playstation game and you are good to go .
there is a lot more you can do but just google a couple youtube tutorials on retroarch and that should help you even more .

if you want to be kind of absurd and go completely raw then sheathing a weapon and pulling out a torch both constitute as object interactions .
furthermore lighting a torch or throwing it would also count .
that however is silly and makes no sense if you stop and think about it .
i do n't think raw is absurd for only allowing one free object interaction in addition to an attack bonus action and movement in a six second turn .
lighting a torch and throwing it then stopping to draw a weapon would probably take a few seconds .
you could do that in one turn but not attack afterwards which makes sense to me .
there are just a couple other rules issues to note here
logically you can carry a torch with your shield hand provided it 's an arm mounted shield and not one you hold .
a home-brewed item maybe but there is no shield per raw that you strap to your arm and then have the hand still free .
as for a two handed weapon if you want to hold a torch at the same time you could really only attack with disadvantage .
per raw this is also incorrect ... you can not attack with a two-handed weapon with only one hand regardless .
this weapon requires two hands when you attack with it . ''

however statistics is still a difficult major as stem majors tend to be and very math heavy and logic heavy .
you have to take the three calculus sequences ma 225 think intro to proofs and linear algebra along with the typical stats classes which involve varying degrees of math .
you are not required to take physics or chemistry as a stats major but you do have to take 2 extra science classes in addition to the gep requirements .
so those could be physics or chemistry but they could also be bio or meteorology .
as a student in the stats program i have thoroughly enjoyed it i definitely feel like i 'm being challenged intellectually but very rarely to i feel overwhelmed .
feel free to dm or ask me anymore questions .
edit i also could n't find anything about accreditation but nc state as a whole is accredited by sac so i 'm sure a department as big as stats has everything they need .
ps4 issue here whenever i fast travel to harpers ferry my character can move around and pick stuff up and interact with the world around him .
the screen just goes black and makes the game unplayable .
fast traveling anywhere else doesnt remove the black screen either the only way to fix this issue is to delete my save data and re log into the game .
on top of that loading screen issues have arisen .
sound will cut in and out the game will try to load in early only to cut back to loading screens and load back in into a dtate where i cant move my dude for several minutes .
i can tolerate duplicators and roaming vigilantes destroying everyone 's bases and stealing harvested loot .
but now im ready to join the whole this game is still an alpha game '' bandwagon .

i 'd trade a lot of the empty wilderness space there is for more urban sprawl real estate .
it 's weird to me that some of the things like the power plant and deep mines and stuff are larger areas interiors and exteriors to explore than a lot the towns and suburbs ... .
in a large scale mmo they should be a lot larger imho .

the full social cost '' would make new housing even less affordable as those seeking to enter into an existing community take on the burden of upgrading the infrastructure to an acceptable level so that they can have what they desire without creating negative impacts for the whole community .
i 'm also to terrified of something backfiring to mess with it .
maybe if i found someone well versed to show me the safer side of it .

it sounds like you just need to find different games to play .
while rdr2 and spiderman may be big successes for ps4 they are n't going to be for everyone .
i ca n't tell you how many big successful system sellers that i have little to no interest in playing .
or you may just need to take a break from gaming .
i did that in my mid 20 's and took a 6 month break from games but i came up to them when a lot more energy and enthusiasm .
if it is n't fun to do then they there 's nothing wrong with taking a break or stepping away from games .
i 'm in my 30 's and have just as many friends who stopped playing around your age as those who still do .
tatsumaki is often portrayed childlike because of her personality .
she acts like a child due to her ego not exactly looking like a child per se .
in fact her sister too is quite immature as well even though her sister wants to portray herself as the lady in command .
anyway tats ' diminutive stature is there to emphasize her outsized ego and powers .
notice how different child emperor who is a child and the other actual children are portrayed .
like you these are my first am1 they are a little tight but they break in .
didja ever think making snide comments about someone 's mental health would make you friends ?
sorry you got called out for shitting on op 's perfectly salient point .

ok i think you 're right i think i read about this in a collective nouns lesson .
the problem is and if you can correct me if i 'm wrong but i do n't think summer camp is a thing anymore .
so how do you remake something that is n't relevant .
i mean they could do an approach similar to strangers prey at night and have the camp be a family vacation spot or something idk .
i just do n't see a remake plausible anyways .
this is a game of the year contender no doubt .
ha someone must have bought it before you and returned it ?
so was this video before or after you shit yourself ?

alright what the fuck this literally happened to me today
because the point of the military academies is to let the best and brightest who desire to serve have an opportunity to develop and get into leadership roles quickly .
should you make it a pay to attend thing you not only weaken the pool of candidates by making it less desirable to attend you also skew attendance even further in the direction of being dominated by those in a higher economic class .
i think most would agree that undermines the mission of the academies .
i 'm out of the loop what 's happening here
you just need to research trade and then build them next to a port .
what would the triangle look like when it 's cut out ?
as soon as chase ran out i wanted jimmie to be the one to push him the rest of the way .
i cried when the camera panned over to him backing up to do it .
it made an otherwise shitty day as a jimmie fan a little bit better .
have you listened to mach hommy tha god fahim ankhlejohn westside gunn ?
also i agree with the joey bada thing i do n't know if he 's necessarily lost but i definitely think he 's lost his footing a lil and imo dropped off hard though i see why people still like him .
i tried to google it and only saw his twitter talking about starting it

i think what partly decided it too was coach 's predictable inability to say i played like a villain pretty much the whole group mentality thing was bs from the start ''
if he managed to do that he could have won .
but that 's like going into an alternate universe where coach is n't dellusional as f .
2000 's wwe as the amount of stuff people could get away with in that era would be fun to watch and the thought process behind certain things has always intrigued me .
why would cw have casually said that the kids ' sheets smelled on a call with nk ?

visually we 're past the point of diminishing returns so in terms of polygon counts there really is n't a need to up those numbers .
where they can improve is better lighting and shadows which are more graphically intensive than people think .
there 's also higher resolution textures better physics etc .
basically from this point on we 're going to see a smaller disparity between aaa titles when it comes to graphical fidelity .
it 's the back-end stuff that 'll improve between generations at this point .
i 've actually been thinking that i wanted to try a silver polish so this was pretty cool .
i do like the orangey shade too but i have a shimmery bronze polish from essie that kind of reminded me of that one so i chose the other !

i loved the extensive story stuff in the first half cheelai and lemo are such great new characters and there was some genuine emotion from the saiyan stuff and both laughs and intimidation from frieza .
vegeta 's fight in particular was my favorite he was just so in the zone the entire time and the theater lost it when he went ssg .
ca n't believe i actually love broly as a character .
the direction deserves extra special praise the color work and camera-work '' were really above and beyond what i 've seen in most action animation .
the idea that people know best what to do with their money '' is patently absurd .
the overwhelming majority of people have absolutely no idea what to do with their money .
none of these statements go against my original statement of
goal always should have been to tax as much as is possible while maximizing revenue .
hard to have a robust welfare state without gas in the tank '' so to speak .

also thanks for sharing this cool story have a great day .
this has happened a bunch of times with my fire cube .
it 's not worth today what it would be worth a couple decades ago .
not surprising since mostly left wing people use reddit these days anyways so it is n't surprising they shout down those who oppose what they want .
overall all of their arguments are based on that we have trustworthy reliable people to run this new government who will help the city which is very unlikely .
dumping money into a problem does n't help if you do n't remove the actual cause of the problem aka city politicians .
considering the simplycash card from american express anyone interested in referring me ?
you 're right but no one knew it would have been a scam because he was actually showing proof that he had it .
it 's a fact the redskins won the nfce in 2015 with cousins as the starter and the lions have never won the nfcn with stafford .
they actually have never won the north the last time they won it was the nfc central .

are you having to hit it in both ways ?
meaning on the long edge as well as the short edge ?
if both i 've done a trick before with some extra 2x4 blocks ... basically make a row snapping the short edge together however you have to then prop it up at the right angle using the 2x4 or a helper against the rest of the complete flooring then snap down the whole row at a time .

according to raid report https raid.report/leaderboard/clears/all ? page=45683 there are over 2.2 million players that finished at least 1 raid in destiny 2 .

in fact smaller tribes have significantly less crime and violence because of the importance of social cohesion and reliance on tribal structure for living .

yes they would have made it out because they saw the vulptex .
it was poe that first noticed the one that stayed behind and followed it to safety .
c-3p0 made an obvious statement that poe already thought but someone needed to say it for the audience .

do n't think amd would redesign a whole new chip based on the vega architecture at this point we know navi is coming so why bother making a whole new chip for gaming now ?
either they are defective mi60 aka mi50 chips or just manufactured as a mi50 chip .
either way since it has or had a lot of fp64 compute since it is apparently disabled now ?
i would assume it is a former '' compute card with some display outputs slapped on there .
st least that 's what makes the most sense considering memory setup and so on .

meh i hear a lot about how i should n't have a huawei phone because people think the chinese government have a backdoor into it and they 're spying on me .
i would n't be surprised but frankly i do n't think xi jinping is all that interested in my podcasts and porn .
and even then what difference does it make if it 's the chinese or the americans the british or our own government ?
the p20 pro is an excellent phone and i do n't really care to let politics affect my phone choices .

after some bad publicity in media it turned out that a local priest had them mount up without consulting it with anyone .
or rather the priest sold this space behind the jesus crown and behind anyones bacj and had n't share the income .
go watch leah remini 's scientology and the aftermath there 's an episode in the 3rd season on jehovah 's witnesses and it is royally fucked up .
it 's weird to still see you with no flair .

followed a similar cleaning procedure new unwashed microfiber cloth for drying after dish soap wash on a pair of maxed out oakley transition lens .

the worst case scenario of a no deal brexit followed by no changes is of 8 lost growth by 2030 .
how do they make the mammal blood cross compatible with reptile blood though ?
that 's funny cause i knew a guy who inherited a family business .
bitched about having to raise his minimum wage and possibly supply medical insurance .
yet he rarely worked there because he was an alcoholic .
as well as spending half the year on exotic trips .
so it seems in my experience the rich want to get paid twice because fuck you i 'm rich .
once for the money they make and twice for the tax breaks they get for creating un-livable waged jobs .

survation 's latest poll showed that they lost support from 41 vote share to 38 vote share if they supported a second referendum .
there was a poll indicating that if they do n't support it their support will drop below that of the lib dems .
unfortunately fptp means voters are at the mercy of the 2 big parties voting lib dem just means you are voting tory .
i think those mps are not doing this because they are in the pockets of our enemies .
they would do the same thing regardless of that .
in an epic battle to protect the earth steven dies leaving only the gemstone behind .
but since he 's half gem he comes back to life .

this sounds similar to what 's described in this github issue https github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/17108 so it might be caused by a bug in the engine 's touch input handling .
yeah that 's not at all what i meant but i guess that 's what it said .
i read it back and decided it was best removed .
anyway what i wanted to do was make fun of the fact that there 's advantage to be had in not being white .
that 's not what i wrote reading it again .

well it becomes a problem when teachers want you to make anything that works in it .
plus it takes so much longer to write anything with it what you could write in a few seconds takes like a minute all of the sudden .

well yah some people are able to skillfully hit most of the time and that 's where it becomes even more deadly and more frustrating to be killed so quickly i 'm just generalizing a bit to give a picture of how it could frustrate someone that is able to dodge most assaults to get shut down with little effort for only being hit once in awhile
and yah it 's how all people should be responding to each other really we 're all people on two sides of a screen we all have our own differing opinions what 's the point attacking someone else 's view just to make yourself feel good does n't help in the large scheme of things i 'm just really concerned about this game 's direction as i love to play it i 've been playing since late season 1 and it 's pretty much is my go to game when i have some downtime from either coding or wanting to take a break from playing something else i love that it 's pretty much the only successful third person skill based moba and the fact it uses such loreful characters from mythology just seals itself in my heart

more likely the sargeant at arms would just tell the secret service that potus is not allowed to enter .
he 's not allowed to barge onto the floor of a closed session of the supreme court and he 's not allowed to force himself into the house .
they are n't trump 's thugs there are just there to keep him safe .
having a gun fight with the sargeant at arms is not keeping the president safe '' .
they would simple be told the potus is not welcome and the secret service staff themselves would just restrain trump themselves and drag him back to his limo .
this is worse it 's taken on the texture of the foil .
wo n't we keep the enchatns once we have them ?
i thought they carried over from league to league ?

i love this thank you very much for the reply this is extremely helpful .
they also had a video of the players saying they thought it was a joke until they walked in .
in fact i do n't think the words toxic are ever used in the ad

i have him with memory imprinted 3 yeah im the lucky guy without hurado lol
nice wonder if that will mean more options in dx 11 too .
invaded them imposed their dictatorships and then went on destroying them .
should they not have invaded them and just let the nazis win ?
also like i said they were n't dictatorships one person did n't have absolute power neither did one party or administrative function .
holding a vote for pre-picked soviet-friendly candidates under gunpoint is no democracy ...
do you genuinely think that you can hold votes at gunpoint then keep up to 500 million people living in fear for decades ?
because people would have revolted before that but they did n't even in 1990 that was n't a revolt that was due to infiltration from reactionaries .

es werden heute kaum noch exclusive infos an journalisten herausgegeben .
in der regel werden heute alle infos von den firmen selber ver√∂ffentlicht um zu kontrollieren was an die √∂ffentlichkeit kommt .
dadurch wird nat√ºrlich der job des spiele-journalisten obsolet weil jeder otto mit nem internetblog den selben job machen kann .
heute darf man in der regel vor dem release eines spiele keine reviews ver√∂ffentlichen weil man sich mit nem schlechten review nicht die vorverk√§ufe versauen will .
f√ºr ein spielemagazin das nur einmal im monat erscheint ist das nat√ºrlich sehr unvorteilhaft weil kein mensch kauft sich ne zeitung um 3 wochen nach release nen test zu lesen .
you could go down to a single support in the middle but as others have said the weight of the curtains would likely make it sag .
one way around that would be to switch out the curtain rod for one that is stronger and could handle the additional span without sagging .
i use these https www.homedepot.com/p/302837685 at my house and they are able to provide enough support on similar span widths without sagging .
because in civilized countries trials like this take months because defendants are allowed due process .

the brain is the part of the body that contains everything that is you .
if your brain was put in a different body successfully it would just be you waking up in a new body .
it would n't be the body 's original owner having occasional leftover thoughts from another person .
it 's probably more accurate to think of brain transplants as body transplants .
the brain is the person that is trying to stay alive by getting a transplant .
what the brain requires is a body that can keep it alive .
also op if it 's properly glued down then it 's an absolute prick to remove .

yeah and our 23 damn turnovers gave him the chance to give us lots of rebounding opportunities !

neither my definition nor threshold for need for help are not relevant to the fact that this is entirely put of context and theres no way to tell if this kid has actual issues or if he heard the phrase and decided to use it as a justification for acting out any time someone tells him to calm down .
i 'm crazy isolated and is a known problem i 've been trying to work on .
when i do manage to socialize it 's like i have no idea how anymore .
used to be a social chameleon could read the room and adapt to any atmosphere relate to almost everyone i talked to .
these days my intuition is shot so i generally have no read on the room or individuals unless emotions are extremely obvious loud laughter sobbing etc .
if someone asks how i 've been my only options are okay you ? ''
or a long winded discussion of my mental health .
usually the first one works but i literally have no response for anything even slightly probative .
my social outings are limited to two places group therapy where it 's easier and appropriate to discuss the crazy and a group of my husband 's friends who know i have issues and are accepting/supportive .
but it 's hard to tell when a topic is too intense in that setting so i generally say nothing about myself at all .
i can join in discussions about games or shows or whatever if i know the topic but i 'm still hesitant to share opinions or disagree with people because i ca n't really tell whether it 's something innocent or could cause a problem .
i 'm kinda on his boat right now and i 'm so confused by how i feel .
i broke up with him in november telling him that i 'm not ready for a commitment and wanted freedom .
i also felt like i was too comfortable and like i was settling down way too young .
he told me today that he 's seeing someone else and i lost it .
he came over to talk about realizing how upset i was .
i 'm so lost and confused about how i 'm feeling .
i really do love him and he said he 'll always love me .
trying to think about why i broke up with him is foggy and jaded by emotion and fear of losing him completely .
i 'm hoping time will tell but also with time comes fading memories .
as of now we are still friends but it 's hard and i ca n't figure out how i feel .
i 'm sorry you 're in this situation i think meeting new people and spending time with friends helps .
we really want to stay connected and it 's been nice because i can still confide to him about stuff like i always have .

i remember going to one of those pop-up poster shop things with my mum back when i was a kid in the early 00 's .
this middle aged man was there was buying simpson-related posters with bart and homer on them from memory purely for the purpose of demonstrating how the characters were bad role models to his kids or students or something .
i remember thinking it was just a tv show who gives a toss ...

blanchard acknowledges trans women including late-transitioning trans women transition due to gender dysphoria and he even suggested renaming gender identity disorder '' to gender dysphoria '' in the dsm 4 an idea that was decided against at the time because they were uncomfortable with labelling children gd but which has now been implemented in the dsm 5 .
what he did claim was that the gender dysphoria appears as a result of the autogynephilia growing over time .
however he still allowed those trans women to transition .
he had a very strict gatekeeping system but he applied it to both those he labelled agp and those he did n't so the gatekeeping issue is orthogonal to the agp issue .
blanchard also did n't claim that trans women were aroused all the time merely by living as their preferred gender and in fact distanced himself from that assertion comparing it to how in a long-term marriage people are n't constantly aroused by being around their spouse .
and fuck what this toxic community of softcocks thonks .

spock has never been one to acknowledge talk about or have warm feelings about or been comfortable with his family .
they showed up on the enterprise had a conversation with kirk spock 's best friend with spock literally only a foot away and spock never actually talked to them or introduced them as his parents .
kirk only happened to find out because he prodded spock about his family while unknowingly and coincidentally standing right in front of them at the time .
same deal with sybok no acknowledgement of his existence until it becomes vitally important to his crew 's mission .
spock having issues with family has been a consistent part of his character from tos onwards .
this really reminded me about a particular video about arcane mages https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=issojfhgtws

oh he still takes care of business just not while watching stuff .
i doubt anyone would last with a smoking hot girlfriend like me .
he must have been watching you and waiting for an opportunity to make his move .
he used that as a ploy to get you out of the house and most likely would have kidnapped you had you fell for it .
he probably knew that your mom was out with the dogs and that 's why he approached .
the fact that he did n't go to any other houses and that he picked a moment where you were really alone leads me to believe he 's been following you or at least keeping tabs on the activity of your house .
he probably saw your mom leave with the dogs and knew no one else was home .
only thing you could do if report it to the police and give a description of him and his van .
but even that 's not really gon na solve anything .
what i would do is get some binoculars or something that will let you see far distances .
and try to not so obviously look outside from inside your house to see if anyone is watching your house .
also tell your mom about it so she 's aware because she could be a target too .
sex trafficking has gotten bad in the recent years so i 'd watch my surroundings and be extremely aware of them .
there 's no telling what he could be capable of .
he could have been trying to see how gullible and naive you were .
he might be trying to figure what way to approach you to make you more vulnerable .
and sadly he now knows where you live now .
i 'm not trying to scare you i 'm just making you more aware that this is a real thing and it happens all over the world .
i would take more precautions and look out for his van anywhere you might be .
if you ever see him again report him to the cops immediately and do n't even engage any conversation or eye contact with him .

i will never understand why apple insisted on ruining their podcast app .
maybe i am just an idiot but i find it to be completely unintuitive i can never remember what to click to get where i want to go they made the saved vs downloaded vs listened vs deleted vs deleted from my library thing very confusing i always end up accidentally playing the podcast when i want to see the series or episode description etc etc .
it seems like they took every workflow in the app and just muddled it a little i do not understand at all !
she 'll be bigger than aubrey and chanel soon .
i love the look of it when it 's down .

oral is n't always on the menu for the wife and i .
we can have a great time and neither one of us does it .
there are times where only i receive and my wife typically says after that it was the way i was touching and caressing her that made her do it .
basically she got so into the moment she went for it .
on the flip side every time i give to her only she gets it .
i get extremely turned on pleasing her that way .
by the time she 's orgasmed a couple times i 'm at full attention no warm up needed and we go for the big finish .

i know george romero was the inspiration for re and i appreciate all his work for zombie films .
i have the utmost respect for the man and i even love his 30-second commercial for re2 and wished it was longer like a short film .
i think if he had a bigger collaboration with the re series it would be more grounded .
i like my re to be a bit over-the-top .
the true name after all is biohazard and the focus was on a corporation experimenting with a mutagenic virus that creates monsters with zombies being a mere side effect if you will .
like zombies are the pawns and the hunters/lickers/chimeras/tyrants/bandersnatches/etc are the knights and towers and kings .
still i do think that if he did make some input i guess we would have more varieties for zombies other than crimson heads .
perhaps special zombies similar to those in left 4 dead or state of decay .
we maybe could have gotten intelligent zombies similar to the russian zombies in resident evil retribution .
speaking of which i am inclined to say that i have read his script for a live-action treatment and although it is closer to the games than any of the anderson films it was mediocre to say the least .
it was all over the place and made me realize a direct adaptation of the games maybe just the first one would be really difficult to pull off .
it 's either a hit or a miss and i do n't want to sound disrespectful but in my opinion his script was a huge miss .
i know it sounds bad and reason to downvote me but romero got more wrongs than rights in his script as much as it was faithful to the source .
edit edited some things i have to say because i do n't want to sound like i 'm trashing romero .
i love the man and god rest his soul but his script was not what i was hoping for .

i have just confirmed that the kids do n't have to toss any reusable containers their food is in !
you would be surprised how hard it can be .
here 's a dumb example but it may help .
imagine the small drama being a lvl 20 enemy .
anyone positive and currently thinking rational is like lvl 100 they can brush it off easily .
someone mentally ill has their stats drastically reduced so no matter what level they are the enemy does some considerable damage .

vortex he 's a breeze me is a horrible nightmare lol .
oh man i could not give less fucks about this and certainly not enough to read your oddisey-sized rant .
as neat as this looks i think it 's a bad plan and here 's why .
roads that this is going to happen on will have a shoulder which is where the cars are going to have to drive .
this create what you see here a lane between two columns of either slow moving or not moving vehicles .
if you 've ever been in a lane that was free flowing next to a lane that was slow moving you know how dangerous that can be to all involved .
i think it 's better to have emergency vehicles drive on the shoulder .
this gives them an open area at least on one side to avoid further accident .
the closest thing to that was the philidelphia project which apparently manifested an object several minutes from the future and then promptly broke .
there 's a significant margin of error between that and rewriting 400bc to suit our shipping fantasies .
it 's funny how buzzfeed now is n't credible yet conservatives never doubted its credibility when the news about kevin spacey broke .

best thing i found for comps at different times get some rest before hand via naps during the day before the event or the night before too late now for tonight !
drinking plenty of water/beer/coffee i do a rotation between them as it keeps your mind and body awake as you have to go make and get them !
and finally make sure you eat later in the day as well as this will throw your daily stomach movements so your body will be working away so it 'll be harder to sleep .

i 've never paid for porn but there 's a specific site i 've been eyeing for the past few months that has art from an artist who makes really good stuff that i specifically enjoy .
almost all of their content is behind a paywall and i 've had trouble finding it elsewhere aside from one comic that 's floating around .

you have no reason to be mad at the dog .
you left your system out where the dog could get it .
your dog either was n't trained well or did n't have proper toys or exercise to prevent the chewing .
this could also cause a lot of harm to the dog still .
if it swallowed any plastic bits they can perforate his stomach and/or intestines
as a dog owner this is 100 your responsibility .
hopefully you learned a lesson about pet ownership because of this .
not to mention the fact that it 's a cover .

for starters you draft from a communal pool throughout the game rather than a set lineup you take into a game on cr .
this means no p2w and you ca n't be countered before a match has ever started .
its also 8 players rather than a 1v1 game .
while that is a true statement i do n't think it applies to that quote .

shit reading this made me realize i had some thought about not living in an already failed nation in my system that it had creeped in like a thief in the night without me knowing .
just the way i reacted to reading this comment made me realize i still had some inkling of hope and care lurking for the us .
which is a roadblock moving on and adapting to a post-us world so bye-bye to that killed it once again with a steel-toed boot to its skull .
technically religious people contradict themselves on this defense of free will .
if god knows everything that has happened and ever will happen it means that your decisions are already determined .

last summer it was 50 twice once mid summer during their big chair event and then once during late summer for back to school .

i got hired on his recommendation and then got fired 3 months in .
it was a learning experience for me and it turns out my firing didnt actually reflect badly on him but i still felt like an asshole .

does all sentient life really need to be in danger again ?
people who move on in a short amount of time usually already have someone waiting in the background .

which is why they used standardised designs and comparatively cheap locally sourced building supplies .
all of which is interesting but of no relevance to pre-war villas which are highly desirable despite being built in the era before modern building regulations .
is n't it funny that buildings built by tradesman with primary school level educations have become our most desirable properties ?
a cynic might suggest that excessive regulation has actually set us back ...
that 's why we have laws against animal cruelty .

despite all the tripe about gender being a socal construct science shows that much of our behavior is dictated by hormones .
some are hormones we are exposed to while in the womb that also produce the physical differences you know penises and vaginas .
then at puberty we are again hit with hormones .
if females xx are hit with the male hormones mainly testosterone iirc while in the womb they masculinize in appearance and exhibit more masculine behavior competitive aggressive etc .
this is research done with animals so social construct does n't apply .
i just read a good article on this the other day but i 'm on my phone and do n't have the link handy .

but there 's no immediately obvious way to force that to happen .
unless you generated the whole world at once of course but again that would be too small a world to be interesting .

i was gon na downvote this but i forgot that this is what i signed up for
we 'll be releasing some rtx terminals before long that allows the little terminal shroud covers to be kept
all the presets and characters from early in the game are still punching bags .
but the ones you get from progressing in the story dlcs and the later pqs are sometimes pretty smart .
my volunteering experience did involve washing a lot of test tubes and other containers now that i think of it .
would that really help in emailing professors asking for volunteer work ?
it could have been joined to fail the quest '' .
on a serious note the most likely cause is that the faster fingers joined the quest ahead of you .
try posting a quest and then sos-ing to see if you still have problems .

subreddit rules r/clashroyale/about/rules reddiquette wiki/reddiquette reddit 's rules wiki/rules new to reddit ?
i was in boy scouts all through junior high and high school and still camp and hike pretty frequently as an adult .
i 've never once had issues setting up a table .
i do n't know if you and the people in the other thread are just making wild guesses about what camping is like or have your own unique table themed troubles or what but this is really a nonissue .
in the same location of the house or at different parts of the house ?
she 'll be caught sooner rather than later but in the meantime it 's dangerous for you guys .
if anything fishy happens you should go to a hotel with security .
there 's nothing more dangerous than a crazy bitch that thinks she 's righteous and entitled to everything .
i 'm sorry she 's spoiling what should be a happy time for your family .
the good news is that once she 's caught she likely wo n't get off with a slap on the wrist and maybe she 'll get the help she needs in prison or at least she 'll be somewhere where she ca n't hurt other people .
usually these systems in theory at least rely on car-to-car communication .
going through a cell tower adds too much latency most of the time .
sent one last wall message with my contact details and notifying people that my account was going to be deleted .
a few days later i deleted it and never looked back !
very happy with the decision and now i only really message the people that matter and no more wasting time on pointless posts drama or conversations .
all the cons really outweighed the pros for having an account .
yes shoving generally meets the criteria for assault/battery in the us .
being called a skank is unlikely to be a useful defense .
injuries could increase your sister 's legal exposure but a lack of injuries will not invalidate the case against her as assault/battery charges do n't require injuries .
the girl 's family ca n't file criminal charges though .
filing a police report gets the process started but that does n't constitute criminal charges .
and the da might opt not to file charges if the evidence is lacking and/or the shoving seems minor enough .
the 30k of each resource is also likely nothing compared to how much they 'll spend grinding the map trying to get that high score either .
it 's just interesting to see how high the gem payouts to those positions are especially with how quickly they then drop off .
well on xbox you pay 15 dollars for the base game and the dlcs are separate buys
lol i slowed down the other day because there was a kid playing near the road and he looked at the big black german car rolling towards him and freaked out .
i think the road workers appreciate it a little more
also regarding the inaccuracy criticisms by certain people i think it would be too hard for all the 8 year olds playing pf to answer a survey on their playstyles and mains
how hard would it be to do a led swap on those ?

my turrets just look at them without a reaction .
even with your explanation i still would n't pronounce it right .
probably my medical background but if your clientele is n't greek in origin it may not be regularly pronounced correctly .
there 's definitely a lot of thought into it though and i like the logic .
i am not i home right now i will arrive in a few hours
blitz is used every once in a while im pretty sure g2 used it in the previous match and their rivals dealt with it by throwing c4s at him haha .
honestly if you need to be a pro player to be able to counter blitz then something is not right ...

and yes of course if 70 of the elected polticians cant form a mayority that just shows how bad a system belgium has and of course thats good for nva .
they could form a majority but there would just be to much ideological differences for it to be workable wich means that all the parties in that coalition would lose heavily politically .
how does that show that the belgian system is bad ?
i often wonder if it got this way because so much importance emphasis has been given to gender stereotypes over the years that you now get people who feel they do n't belong in a gender because they do n't fit the stereotypes .

i would suggest you to always find easier methods the moment you see that the things that you do take way too much time .
nice to see balance on here did n't expect to see anything from sheff on this subreddit
the editing is very clean jokes were high quality also .
the only things i would have added personally would be maybe a couple more poopisms like a scramble or 2 but obviously that 's just preference .
overall it looks like you know what you 're doing based off of that short clip and i 'm kind of excited to see what else you can pull off
i would n't say you have fewer rights but a lesser amount of the same ones .
we have supreme court decisions currently on the books that reach the conclusion that money=free speech therefore it follows that if you have less money you have less access to free speech .
restrictions on the right to vote have been curtailed in the past land ownership poll tax but they are being reinstated with the specific applications of voter registration and voter id laws .
georgia purged people from its voter rolls for having po boxes or forwarding addresses which is almost literally a reinstatement of the land ownership requirement .
voter id laws also specify the types of id that can be used to specifically exclude ones that poorer people are more likely to have .
you also typically have less access to the polls in the form of inability to take time off of work and difficulties in reaching polling stations in some areas or long lines due to insufficient stations or machines .
you are not created equal but are born with a significantly reduced life expectancy and will not necessarily be afforded any rights or opportunity .

to what extent if any should canada australia new zealand and other commonwealth realms under the crown be considered as a single entity in your 'two ways to look at it ' ?
there are nearly an infinite number of ways to draw dividing borders based on an entity 's attributes but none are definitive .
not even the list of entities considered to be a nation is agreed upon .
see the list of unrecognized nations on wikipedia which includes sealand .
we could define a nation or country based on legal structure economic influence cultural or racial attributes geographic divisions like mountains and rivers military enforcement or questionable border walls .
for the purpose of the original post 's exercise being able to name individual states within the u.s. is not an unreasonable comparison to naming countries in europe .
for all other purposes we thankfully have other types of maps .
you can get started on the cheap with a raspberry pi .
without a good idea of what you want it to do it 's tough to guide you but id look into some of the below areas .
python flask web applications you could build a website for use on your network or an rest api .
useful if you want any sort of email automation or anything like that .
ssh secure connection to your machine log in remotely and use the server via command line .
dynamic dns if you want remote access to your server but do not have a static ip .
plex stream video from your server either locally or remotely .
cron flexible command scheduling eg have a certain script run every 10 minutes between 13:00 and 15:00 on a tuesday or whatever you like
amazon echo aws lambda it is possible to create alexa skills that can for example send commands to your server or fetch some information from it .
you can do the same with google home i 'm sure .
fun example my daughter sits in bed past her bedtime on her laptop .
can activate a skill which connects to the server which fires a script to ping the ip attached to the laptop if the ping gets a response then that 's returned to alexa who tells me that yes she is on her laptop would i like to cut her connection ?
if i respond yes a command is sent to the server which logins into the router running ddwrt and activates an access control rule by flipping a value in the nvram then restarts the firewall cutting her connection .
philips hue api programmatically control your hue light bulbs .
or for a more interesting challenge pick up an arduino or a pi zero gpio board and a solid state relay but do n't if you 're not sure about what you 're doing .
is it a hm drop or can it be farmed regular ?

this is why i 'm hesistant to take up scuba diving .
worms and worm-like creatures just freak me out and there 's something that huge with creepy looking teeth under the sand in the water .
i think you 've completely missed the point i was making .
all i said was upc/yuki did it without having saline for mhera farming .
that itself is a huge achievement with or without an alt 's help as you 've pointed out .
what i 'm claiming for upc 's case anyways is that upc did n't reach 1000 either by doing mhera that itself spoke volumes .
they did n't also farm with their alt all the time either i 've farmed several hours with them back then and i 'm sure i was n't the only one and unfortunately not everyone had the resources and funds like other people to go on par with yuki/upc back then .
as you 're aware there 's also a colossal gap of xp between 1050 and 1047 .
and also at the time of writing upc is 1089 and his alt is 1052 so there 's that .
so actually as i write this i find that even more impressive the fact that you have to rely on other people to get you to 1050 sort of dampens your own 'self ' achievement at the cost of doubling down for yourself because it takes double the effort to work on two accounts and in the case of upc it 's more than twice the effort because he works full time and majority of the time when na is playing he 's either sleeping or working and for the longest time and maybe even now everyone was relying on him for information with respect to the game .
he was never going to get to 1k with the help of others who were living on the side of the world .
so yea it 's more than nothing special '' .
you misunderstand what i mean alot of killers and survivors complain about noed and alot of killers and survivors complain about totems in general .
no one really complains except a few survivors about the fact noed is a hex totem perk .
also i am pretty sure of those 80 '' they do n't only play survivor and i am pretty sure no all of the 80 think noed is a problem .
thank you so much for your sweet and kind words .
i appreciate you taking your time to reply to my thread .
you 've no idea how comforting it is to see you and everyone like you who replied sharing their kind words i feel less alone .
have a blessed day wherever you are and my condolences to your two little girl piggies who knows maybe they are up in a guinea pig heaven with my little chigga .
holy crap man why are people now a days so obsessed with thinking they know what 's best ?
i wish you luck with putting up with these type of people op and hopefully this is n't what ends humanity .
shit i live in the bible belt and it 's going on in universities here
sorry to say this but this is n't the sub for you you 're wayy past beginner art go to like intermediate or expert art if that 's a thing .
since everyone here is just as new as you i do n't think many people would have any quality constructive criticism either .
all i can say for now is that it looks fantastic
thanks i see now i only have 4 so far
i do n't give two shits about what people think of buzzfeed but i 'm all about anything that gives weight to anything bob mueller says .
i did and i 'm guessing you did n't actually read any of the articles just saw the headline and are now trying to discredit everyone
the statement by robert mueller 's office on friday night does n't cite any specific errors .
spokesman peter carr says buzzfeed 's description of specific statements to the special counsel 's office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding michael cohen 's congressional testimony are not accurate.
characterization of the documents and testimony obtained by this office regarding michael cohen 's congressional testimony are not accurate . ''
they did n't get it from us '' nowhere do they say the statement itself is false .
sources were sdny not mueller 's team that 's what they got wrong .
mueller is protecting their rep by stating they are leak free .
now if given the ultimatum to either kill baby hitler or let him him grow up to become hitler i would kill him
the whole premise of the ultimatum is that you know he 'll be hitler otherwise he would n't be baby hitler and that you ca n't stop him from being hitler .
to use an analogy it 's akin to the trolley problem .
the whole point of the trolley problem is setting up a situation where you ca n't reasonably just stop the train .
if it makes it clearer you can say well the time machine will only work once and it 'll only let you lock onto say 10 seconds of baby hitler 's life until you 're yanked back .
10 seconds is n't enough to meaningfully change his life other than probably death or serious maiming .
in this case the question that 's trying to be answered is is it ever ok to kill a baby if their birth will for sure or very likely lead to a bad thing '' hitler is substituted in for something that is uncontroversially about as bad as can be so you do n't have to worry about well is it really 'bad enough ' ''
if baby hitler we 're responsible then that would mean that everyone might be responsible for every possible bad thing that they could have done in the universe pretty much making anyone killable for that justification .
they would n't because in the real world we ca n't know anyone 's future actions .
the whole point of the scenario is to set up a hypothetical to get a larger moral point without getting bogged down by details .
it 's what 's called a 'toy problem ' .
although it would be an interesting moral question what happens if you could know say for 99 certainty .
because even if i bettered baby hitler someone else would probably just take his place .
while movements overall definitely do n't depend on one person there are often lynchpin moments like the reichstag fire .
while there likely would 've been some type of social unrest without key moments of history happening it 's entirely possible there is no widespread war .
i just want them to go back to a top four episode with a music video with one person being eliminated based on track record and music video performance before progressing to the top three in the finale .
the thing is apart from being boring and predictable this huge focus on reveals in drag race just acts as another example of the series preaching what constitutes 'good drag ' or 'palatable drag ' for both a mainstream audience and a more general queer one .
when the series has this huge focus on celebrating a queen doing a splits or doing a reveal it just makes the audience think that 's what drag is '' .
but if you look on social media even if a splits or death drop would n't work for the song fans are raging at queens for not doing them in the lip sync .
and it 's a real shame that the powerfulness of drag performance perhaps exemplified through things like latrice in you make me feel trinity in emotions and chi chi in and i am telling you are shunned and labeled as 'bad drag ' because fans want splits and death drops .
and i think the lip sync tournament in the finale is really contributing to that .
it worked in s9 the song choices were great and the reveals made sense and worked .
in s10 it was just an absolute shit show .
and the younger fans and childish twinks ate it up .
your buses ca n't get leaked if you do n't have any
high galactic is the in-universe explanation for having the latin alphabet in star wars .
it 's canon and was also used in legends .
the news broke like two hours ago so most of the commenters in this thread including me when i posted my original comment had n't seen mueller 's statement .
y'all forget young guys make mistakes and have to learn
i had a student not put the gear down in an arrow once wanted to see how far he would take it .
tower told him to go around at 150 feet .
i was going to give him 50 more before i said go around .
similar to pot but less intoxicating and mostly focused in the head is how kief/hash is for me .
i edited my original post since everybody was asking .
thanks for not being rude like some of the other commenters .
food hacks spawned from life hacks '' which according to know your meme originated back in 2003 with technology journalist danny o'brien called the father of life hacks '' .
he was interested in secret software '' ‚Äîprogrammers ' personal shortcuts‚Äîand in o'brien 's words the way of cutting through an apparently complex system with a really simple non-obvious fix . ''
from programming life hacks expanded to '' tricks skills or shortcuts that are meant to increase a person 's productivity or efficiency in their everyday lives . ''
let 's agree on what good hacks should do hacks should solve or purport to solve a tangible problem to make the task at hand either possible or easier .
hacks are creative for the purpose of utility and resourcefulness .
hacks do n't promise to transform your state of being they promise to make a fix in the moment . ''
adding garlic to macaroni cheese is not a hack .
adding a single ingredient to something is not a hack unless maybe it 's a more readily available substitute and even that is a hell of a stretch .
add some bacon to your mac and cheese and it will really pop !
i mean it will but oh wait not a damn hack .
seriously this might be the straw to finally break the camel 's back .
i 'm thinking that he does the whole syndrome thing but maybe he started out with good intentions but the glory goes to his head and he takes it too far .
i sold to open a call spread before earnings they expired worthless so up 500 on that trade .
shoulda done more of that instead of just buying puts ...
only up 5 or so on 10k worth of puts expiring feb1-15 .
i hope nflx does more inverse qqq but this time it goes red when qqq is green not the other way around ...

i 'm 31 and will be a year sober off alcohol in a few days i struggle with bi polar disorder so i 'm still trying to even things out and find other things i enjoy but i love to run it helps a lot
holy christ ... yeah okay not moving to amsterdam that location is officially off my potential home locations ... not that i thought i could afford it anyway but still ...
he also drank alcohol for the first time on survivor .
that 's why it sometimes gets stated the way the previous commenter did and why production might not want to put him back in that environment .
save up for a few years before you buy iracing .
by then you will have a wheel and a mid-sized bank account .

i just do n't understand how people do n't think players can improve in the course of over 6 months .
i actually believe mickie has a skill of learning new techniques of playing a hero .
he did n't even play dva much before they won apex season 1 .
not saying he 's going to be the best player but he does have his worth in the league .
if you mess with the bull you 'll get the horns .
i used h264 constant quality 21 encoder present slower or very slow constant frame rate same as source
its possible but only if axle was hitting the link or maybe if the link contacted the rotor or wheel somehow .
turning right and getting a grinding sound sounds like a possible cv axle .
yeah your noise is definitely due to that link .
depending on where you go the recommended labor time to replace one is 0.4-0.6 .
have them check the other side as well while its in the hoist or do it yourself by grabbing the lower joint on the link and having a friend rock the car side to side .
with every choice i kept thinking 'what if i 'd chosen the other one ?
i need to remember to come back to this point . '
i was so preoccupied with keeping track of all the branches i needed to go back and test that i lost interest in the actual plot .
unfortunately your submission appears to mirror a common thought .
please remember that as per rule 1 all showerthoughts must be original and unique .
yes but then if they were off would n't that mean their sources were lying ?
seems like a possible set up of fake newsery .
this should be gilded or something lol hes right .
back before i got diamond i struggled hard against lance and mained mirage as well !
i then realized that to beat lance since lance 's attacks move the character you need to adjust your positioning accordingly .
also playing verticly against lance is a great option while playing against it !
once i figured out how to get past lance i was able to get to diamond and then 2200 !
keep it up turn the game volume down too lance sound fx are annoying lmao .
hahha i 'm going to post so much you will be sick of me !
how much of a narcissist do you need to put your boring family photos on imgur ?

he conspicuously did n't answer the question about working with his former b.a.p members .
perhaps he 's not allowed to allude to their decision regarding their contacts .

also i 'm working in a big agrochemical company .
i feel proud of myself and my parent 's raising all the days of my life .
being poor made me see more value in the things i conquer and do by myself .
it can also be cpu or a bend pin but failing motherboard is more likely in this issue .
historically yes it does but the places where most of the people live is very left leaning and significantly less racist any place that has a lot of white people and not a lot of anyone else is bound to be racist in some ways .
might try that with some oatmilk and use that for coffee .
yeah i would n't know for sure just what the plug tells me bc i live in atlanta lol

the op comments are out of date they lost their ability to advance and charge when they gained deep strike in the codex .
which honestly i hate i preferred them before this change .
the whole point of a daily challenge is that it something relatively easy compared to the weekly ones and nothing unique .
there are n't that many changes that are even used for dailies and giving people the option of 3 would take away the rng of it all .
like i skip challenges all the time when i know my squad wont get on or i 'm playing squads so wont be going solo .
basically the whole point of the daily challenges are being random and something extra epic have allowed us to do to get more stars

here she 's claiming to blend bananas http reddit.com/r/iama/comments/ahaeg5/i_am_severely_disabled_and_bedridden_at_only_21_i/eedx4hc a decidedly non-keto food that definitively would n't be a great idea if you 're trying to keep your blood sugar down .
the primary focus of this update has been the introduction of the new stalker mode .
playing as a stalker pits you as a kid working against the club .
you invade their missions and record them for the enemy .
every time you record them or their crimes their sins are logged notifying the nearby ai and eventually calling out the shape .
once the shape is out every recording shows the shape where the kids are .
you are victorious if every member of the club is put to sleep by the shape .
the stalker is very weak relative to the club so victory will be rare .
your score is stored however and you can be rewarded just for that .
these are seeded into the world on conditions you will have to discover yourself and will be rare initially .
when you invade a game you can move between red doors and enter unnannouced .
the kids wil not know you are there until you start recording them or their sins .
each time you do this they receive an in game message .
if they catch you you lose if they complete their mission you also lose .
you can return to the red doors after a cooldown use them smartly to lose pursuit and confuse your enemies .
as loyal club kids you may be invaded by a stalker after reaching level 5 !
when they enter your mission you will not know until they start recording you .
work as a team to bring them down for bonus xp .
the kid that catches the stalker also gets added to the leaderboard and gets a little extra xp .
after you have been invaded once you will not be invaded again until you invade someone else .
once you have invaded another player games you host can be invaded going forward invasion is opting into stalker mode .
stalkers can only invade missions that have more than one player to make sure the club kids have the advantage .
so team up if you want to see stalkers !
with this update come new leaderboards most stalkers caught most wins as stalker and highest stalker score .
every week these leaderboards will reset and the players at the top of each will receive a unique customization that can only be earned through this system !
you can view the stalker wins and score in the new stalker van available after level 5 and the stalkers caught leaderboard is visible in the normal hideout .
we have tested this mode internally as much as we could but we realize that the reality with live players could be very different .
we expect to continue to iterate on this mode and make changes based on community feedback .
invasions may be too rare or too common stalkers might not have enough missions available to invade there is much we expect to learn and we look forward to hearing what you think .
stalking is not available all the time by design we consider this an addition not the core mode of play .
as usual this update comes with many fixes and improvements including basic eye animations for the kids your eyes even close when you shut them in game a new sleeper pajama mesh hi mom !
there have also been significant optomizations to reduce load on the cpu which should really help framerates on host players .

happened to me as well on the 2nd day of the tournament .
i had to replay the day to fight arlo .
i think you ca n't stand too close to the gate and just quickly get in the moment it opens .
your right-hand man keeps accidentally using your real name .
your mask snags on things and is pulled off .
do n't want to waste it but i need to make a video .
if it was just a bit arin would n't be so offended by the criticism he gets for it i.e .
if it 's all an act he should be happy people buy into the act so well not calling people haters/avoiding criticism when people call him out on his atrocious behavior .
realised where i fucked up in my previous post .
she has n't killed anyone ... sooo ... she 's not the worst .
i do n't think we saw enough to indicate whether or not lewis had anything left in the tank this year .
i think he was misused and probably an addition that gutekunst wanted moreso than the coaching staff and whom mccarthy could n't think of uses for .
none of this is saying we should re-sign lewis to be incredibly clear .
i 'm saying we have n't seen what was or was n't there .
he said in really no uncertain terms what we 've all suspected for a while that that offence was not a system that made easy use of what a te brings to the table .
the tone of his interview gave off a clear impression that marcedes did n't even feel like he really got the chance to be a packer at all like the season was just a confusing whirlwind that came and went and now it 's over .
i do n't think you can count last year for or against lewis .
he 's used to being a guy that takes on a big workload and barely got to see the field in a scheme that obviously felt chaotic and suboptimal .
tramon has shown us that you can appear immortal in your 30s one year and then look very much your age the next so that 's something to be mindful of as lewis also is n't exactly the chiseled and uber-disciplined athlete that t.will is .
it 's a big question mark and i 'm very curious to see if lewis will take a near-vet-minimum deal to finish out his career as a packer and work with hackett again in a system more fit for te play as he sees it .
but i really do believe that we just have n't seen what he 's got in the tank one way or the other .
hey look its a commercial saying bullying is bad !
it 's the only one i have that actually pulls this much into the yellow spectrum .
color club kinda sorta came out with some i want to say around 2010-2012 that had a slight yellow in it .
if you can ever get your hands on one i believe china glaze has a yellow holo in that weird cyber chat anacronym collection too .
i want it so yellow it makes you feel like you bit into something sour and so holo i 'm flashing it across the room .
what torture technique would it take for you to spill ?

a trade just went through in my 9 cat 10 team league and i do n't know what to think about it lebron and de rozen for james harden .

i generally love open debate but looking at the post history..it seem white society is to blame for all the worlds woes fuck us for bringing the aboriginals modern medicine and standards
a treaty is let 's be frank and open is going to be fucking useless will it magically make jobs appear in alice springs..no
will it force parents in remote communitys to send their kids to school no .
will it make people realize in a modern world you may not be able to hold onto ur cultural roots.and may have to move to become a part of a world that is progressing forward .
yothu yindi himself said that aborigianl men and women need to stop looking to the past and look to a unity in our future as a nation you ca n't find common ground when you are accusing the other side for something there ancestors did 100 years ago
minority families do n't do this because they are minorities they do it because they are systemically impacted by several factors that make it more difficult to parent .
for example minority families are far more likely to have single-family homes or have parents who work multiple part-time jobs meaning they are not at home with their children after school as often as families that have a stay-at-home parent or parents who work standard 9-5s .
less time with children means less time to do things that we know are important for parenting connecting and schooling such as eating dinner together having nighttime routines reading together or having non punitive conversations .
perhaps this is n't what you meant but what your message implies is that minority parents are lazy and want the easy way out by having their children parented by the education system .
this could n't be further from the truth in fact many minority families are fearful of such an idea because they know that there are devastating racial divides in the school system .
improvements in parent involvement would solve a good chunk of educational issues in the us but it is not nearly the full picture and it is not nearly as easy of a solution as your painted .
how can we support something we have n't even really tried ?

the desert wasteland was boring and depressing add in the mundane combat with limited ammo and it just got old and grindy pretty fast .
there 's this really keen little moment the final frame of the film hereditary .
just as the film started in a diorama the film ends in a diorama too .
it begs this enormous question this cult spent the entire film trying to summon this demon and they succeeded but the expression on its face and this final frame in a diorama it 's clearly not as in charge or control as they think it is .
it 's as lost and confused and broken as they are .
so if the demon king paimon is n't in control and the cult is n't in control who is ?
are we all just tugging each other 's strings in a hostile circle ?
it 's easy to be disappointed or to overlook it the wisecrack team certainly did in their show me the meaning '' podcast but i 've been thinking about that moment for 3 months and i ca n't shake the sense of dread that the ending was telling us some miserable secret about the meaning of it all .

jungkook was just so gosh darn adorable throughout this his smiles melt my ice heart .
the problem would n't be people who watch hockey it 'd be the articles afterwards by the people who only saw a clip and articles can translate .

but do you actually think he was just ‚Äòstanding in front of a native american ' without any further intention ?
i have seen two videos the viral one and another one where maga hat wearing teenagers have completely encircled a group of maybe 10 native americans .
they are n't chanting ‚Äòbuild the wall ' but they are clearly trying to intimidate or mock and the protagonist in this drama really was front and centre in it all .
you would n't think the need for routine would be that hard to understand .
after all even kids without special needs do better with routines .
he was never a bad player not really sure why the narrative became he was n't really worth anything .
he was just stuck behind porter in rotation with zero chance of getting ahead of him .

from what i know of the mojave desert i live in europe it 's hot and has intense sun .
a lot of salad greens ca n't grow in such an environment so you should search for some that might do .
i know of some sweet fruits but that 's just additionaly to a diet .
for example cacti that develop fruits like prickly pear and dragon fruit .
i think there are some cacti where you can eat the leaves '' too .
if you are vegetarian/vegan it would probably be ok because the ph is usually in a range of 7-8 like water .
but if not your urine is acidic and in the long run your soil would be too .
so it should be plants that like a low ph .
you should also drink a ton of water so that the urine is n't as concentrated .
i 'm not sure how it 'll damage the plants in the long run if you do n't .
i also recommend to grow plants that develop deep roots into the soil so that they reach some water reservoirs if there are any deep in the ground .
that way they wo n't need as much fresh water .
and i think i do n't need to mention that but i do anyway plant them in the shade so that the sun is n't as intense which usually burns the leaves and water wo n't evaporize as quickly .
the right to exist in the case with israel has to do with enemy states wanting to actively kill or disperse the jews who have re-created the state .
the right to exist here correlates to whether the jews should reclaim their country rather than typical geopolitical reasons that have led to other states dissolving .
if we were to use your geopolitical argument it would correlate to whether israel should maintain its current population of jewish people but to be re-named or split into three counties with new names .
do you plan on making it capable of a return trip ?
gon na have to second this one at least wrt to food as i 'm no beer aficionado .

when rebecca asked him about he he immediately dismissed it and said do n't worry about it. like he 's hiding something big .

plus i wan na see how she learned how shoot most likely taught by weisz and her reasoning for wanting to be a b cuber or something
in my experience if he is n't okay with it now he never will be .
he cant see you 've learned from your mistakes and chances are he wo n't trust you as you need to be trusted for a relationship to work .
consequences have actions but that does n't mean you are unworthy or unclean it just means you need to find someone who understands people grow from mistakes .
as much as you feel like crap about it it 's in the past and it 's a lesson learned .
i had to figure out how to forgive myself before i could find myself in a happy relationship again and now that i 'm there i know i would never and could never do anything to sabotage what i have .
you can and will find better but in this relationship there is tainted trust and with some people there simply is no fixing it .
just remember messing up does n't mean you are n't worthy or that there 's something wrong with you it just means that like everyone else in the world you 've made mistakes .
it 's a oversized fit similar to how asap guess is .
so if ur a l get a m for a regular fit or a l for oversized boxy .

to conflate that with trans panic '' is completely absurd .

what they do with that information is on them .

trans panic relates to what people do with that information .

here is a better video showing that the kids had commpletely surrounded this gentleman and were jumping up and down and chanting 'build that wall ' edit the 'build that wall ' apparently was chanted at a different time not sure what is being chanted here
apparently just before this incident the maga kids were yelling at 2 african american teens and the teens were yelling back and the native american dude tried to diffuse the situation .
'' i did not feel safe in that circle '' said kaya taitano a student at the university of the district of columbia who participated in the march and shot the videos .
she told cnn that the teens were chanting things like build the wall '' and trump 2020 . ''
taitano said the whole incident started when the teens and four young african-americans who 'd been preaching about the bible nearby started yelling and calling each other names .
it got pretty intense taitano said so nathan phillips an elder with the omaha tribe started playing his drum and chanting what she was told was a healing prayer to help defuse the situation .
phillips walked through the crowd and taitano said things were starting to calm down until he got to the grinning boy seen in the video .
'' this one kid just refused to move and he just got in nathan 's face '' she said .

yep but the general question i saw that day was is it landable ?
an srv trip around the contact point would be awesome .
zero sense of the flow of the game this season .
it must be marketed as some other animal ... ... reminds me of the rat hat from seinfeld where sable nutria .
i think telling someone you could have beat their ass easily years ago is douchier .
especially when the money flex comes as a reply to that cuntiness .
i say that the format appeals more to a younger and new crowd but does n't mean it encompasses every single person who enjoys it .
i also never said a ton of people win more than 3/5 games in bo3 but those that can do so because the format allows them to leverage skill .
bo5 does n't happen outside pt top8 because it takes too much time .
3 was chosen as a great balance point between speed and balance of effect of variance .
you point basically translates to we can mitigate variance more by playing best of 21 every match .
that is hyperbolic obviously but of course playing more games lowers the effect of variance .
i 'm not saying that bo1 ca n't be a fun format but for the group of players that care about formats at all aka the players that play in organized play while not the majority of magic players it is a rather large having a level of high competition is one of the reasons for playing .
the fact that we have a pro community at all and a swath of people that follow it closely shows it .
i even said i think bo1 has a place in magic but it 's not the end all be all and should n't replace bo3 as the tournament format .
for a fun time on arena or with friends or even a quick draft it is great .
but turning competitive tournaments to bo1 would be a mistake in my opinion .
my father is some what of a pyro i inherited that gene .

yta that man trusted you enough to share that information with you and you broke that trust .
yeah but to put you in that kind of moral predicament is hardly a reward .

i said to my partner i feel that all it would take to knock it out of the park in the real estate world either sales or rentals is a few simple things
turn up on time every time call ahead if you can not
follow those simple rules and i ca n't help but think you would be the greatest real estate agent in the world .
i think if you can manage the above you 'll be halfway successful at anything .

there was no statutory basis for the president to create a new class of immigrants that received government benefits .
further the obama administration did not follow the administrative procedure act 's rulemaking process to create the new program .
oh of course the racist nyt is going to avoid any estimates of how much it slows down they want to make it as alarming and scary sounding as possible properly representing facts be damned .
this is the same racist newspaper that wrote a story about how expensive curtains are because they wanted to get a political dig in.they only issued an apology cause they got their own story wrong and it made their political party look bad .

this was one of the major things that i did during the wrath of the machine exotic quest .
i always pointed people towards raid secrets and particular posts that helps gather the best information .
the difference is i was doing it to help the community solve a mystery where most of these people do n't give a shit about the community they just want your views and advertisement money .

most plants that are variegated will grow more completely green in low light and show their other colors more when grown in bright sun .

i 've been really impressed with how much mine does with 8gb .
only in the last year have i noticed it start chugging a bit .
ca n't remember if there was an i5/8gb option or not .

i think it depends on the employer also it ease ferry of the workers to the work sites ...
i mean it 'd work fine i just do n't see the point personally .
joining a groop to camp elsewhere seems impractical imo .
personally i 'd ditch the tent sleep on a cot or in a hammock under a canopy and enjoy groop camping because it 's truly the best way to roo .
but i hope it works and i hope you have a great fuckin time at the happiest place on earth !
man i 'm always disappointed in myself when i forget to bring my switch with me when i poop .
which is mind boggling considering fluorescent lights have the same shit in them .
i 've known you 're not supposed to break the damn things since i was a kid .
trump knows less than little 10 year old me apparently .
r5 in the mod end of a new beginning peru begins in a civil war .
however in the game 's code this is just a starting war like the base game 's 2nd italo ethiopian war and not a civil war like the spanish civil war .
therefore the ai did n't take all states leading to a funny screenshot
i personally find those segments entertaining more so coming back to them than when i first saw them .
old running man in general just ages extremely well in my opinion .
even if you personally didnt enjoy it i doubt that you regretted watching the rest of the episode .
but i 'm talking episodes that are borderline unwatchable because they either have lackluster concepts or are executed poorly .
usually especially in recent episodes if the games and missions arent interesting enough if the members have enough funny interactions then the episode can pass off as an okay one .
however if i sit through an entire episode without laughing once thats a problem .
i was walking along a road with a steep drop-off and a cliff on the other .
two dogs come charging out at me and back me up against the edge but i ran towards one menacingly and it backed off so i was able to get out .
i 've been attacked by dogs 3 times in all three times it 's been a stereotypical attack dog in this instance a rotweiler and a fucking chihuahua .
oddly enough the rotweiler was the one that broke and backed off .
i would love to be in a state where all the rich are running away .
there 's nothing wrong with the rich running away .
it 's money coming into my state that has caused me to put off purchasing a new home .
most young married couples here ca n't afford a house now .
the idea that we have to serve the rich is nonsense .
when money leaves an area it becomes more affordable to do nearly everything there .
looks like the handwriting in the speech bubbles in poptropica
the wall only deals with the symptom not the actual problem .
i 'm sure milton friedman would understand supply and demand .
if we end the demand for illegal labor we will see a massive drop in the supply of illegal labor .
maybe if this country would prosecute those people who hire illegal labor instead of putting them in the white house we might not have an illegal immigration problem .
how many seerculls you got in your bank bro ?
am i the only one that gets annoyed by people like fred ?
not the type of people who fit that perfectly but the really good people who purposely take off all of their hats no strange or killstreaks a simple name and will not talk in chat at all ?
i 'm not saying if you are good you have to get hats or anything it just seems like most people do it in a condescending way .
either that or i 'm just jealous that i ca n't beat them in a sniper duel .
i used to have 3 then i changed my thief to a girl cause i wanted caithness armor look
how does their plan prevent homeowners from installing rooftop solar ?
i have about a gram of ostarine that i bought about 9 months ago but got discouraged to use it without a test base or even a pct and i did n't want suppression since i 'm was natty .
i did n't know this sub existed then but i 've been bulking since then and am wondering if anyone would suggest that i use it now still natty .
if it matters i 'm 21 m 5'11 205lbs about 18 bf
every time i see johnny hockey 's concentration face it makes me so uneasy .

can we talk about how fast that deer on the left ate the piece of bread ?
i work in a grocery store produce department and my boss loves to sing random songs talk about memes and sometimes asks me to throw fruit at him so he can try to cut it in half with our produce blades .
i was doing the karts at msrhouston maybe 10 years ago when the guy in front of me had a fuel leak .
i could clearly see it too because gas made a dark line on the light colored pavement and i was running the same line as him .
it actually ignited like 50 feet before the pit exit and he took that chance to gtfo .
i briefly passed through a small wall of fire and ran one more lap .
fire was out before i even got back around .
when i talked to him later he was like it 's not the first time i 've been on fire .
i would have gotten off the kart anywhere on the track but i knew the fire extinguishers were over there so that 's where i got out.
no wonder he was ahead of me the whole time .
ayeee ... .now we need superman and brad pitt to come out
now i am worried that non-educated delinquents are educating themselves on how to build and properly install a car bomb .
we love the same sport the same shows the same animals everything .
no matter what we 're doing when i 'm with her it 's fun .
the fact that she 's drop dead gorgeous also helps .
she broke up with me about 2 weeks ago now .
as much as i hope she eventually changes her mind on things i doubt it .
dune 's sequels are divisive because the sequels take the original story of the triumph of the 'good ' protagonist over the evil antagonist '' and turns it on its head .
dune messiah is not a continuation of this happy '' story which is why it divided people .
the opening chapter of 'messiah ' bronso 's conversation with his captor still sticks in my mind .
the dark side of the force is a pathway to many memes some consider to be unnatural .
personally i have a journal that i mostly use for brainstorming sewing knitting and quilting projects but over time its grown to include random thoughts some work related notes sketches and attempts at calender/bullet journal style pages .
i like the eclectic feel with using whatever for pens and occasionally taping in little notes from other things with washi tape .
if i really hate a page or two i 'll fold the over or tape them together .
i figure i 'm really the only one looking at it and this approach makes me happy .
this is what i think about every time i tell a joke that does n't land .
well no it does n't really stop at mean things .
like i said it 's when people do things simply because they can .
this might be one of the sexiest pictures on here !
they also did n't have facial recognition technology and cameras back then
bigger tax base for appropriations toward the state dot .
but what effect does the moisture actually have on the feather shuttle ?
yeah i felt like that after spurs and then look what happened !
i 'm not getting carreid away on emery we had games like this under wenger with exactly the same squad talking points about character afterwards and we know how that turned out .
i 'm bloody happy rubbing it in the faces of a few chelsea fans but i 'm not going to think we 've turned a corner just yet .
plus we 've got a fucking horrific run of games coming up
if i match with someone with a deepsea diving picture i would not write about them being very good at it because i do not know anything about it .
looks like you know your stuff when it comes to deep sea diving .
you know enough to run a tour for people in such a setting .
2 no i mean i was a part of a tour .
and then 1 would probably laugh at their own interpretation and they 'd share a funny moment .
the argument you 're making is its impossible to tell who started it !
because the one who started it is the criminal .
its called inciting minor to indecent act '' which means the person doing the inciting is the criminal .
you 'd put the ringleader of a teenage crime group in more legal trouble than the followers for instance .
inb4 it 's actually 4 ikes in different sizes .
carlos anthony ice king and ice queen were specifically noted to be unique classes when the rework goes out .
all of the other new winter heroes were noted to offer a unique benefit '' which i would assume being different classes on rework but there 's no guarantee .
i would be but if your pussy is half as tight as your body id get over it
i wonder how noticeable the difference between 16mm and 12 mm is .
about the same field of view change that you see between 16mm and 20mm on your kit zoom relatively speaking .
it 's noticeable but not a huge difference particularly when shooting landscape .
pretty good since we 're working with about 0.57 here .
i used to call the robot you controlled in that ed-209 .
i\`m glad the world will see how mature we all are about all this ...
on the normal point the name should include some self-definition '' in its name so it will defy the time to be corrupt and will always present the true intentions for the creation of the name .
but it has to be catchy in the same time too .
cant think of anything at the moment but i think that is what jp should aim at .
no i do n't hate michael and i do n't hate discovery .
i love the series and watched the first two episodes of season one multiple times enjoying it more as i watched it .
the title said this was the only thing that bugs me .
i do n't mind the main focus on one character .
it 's not the greatest thing but i do n't hate it ... ..
i do n't mind the preachy bits here and there in each series .
all i 'm saying is she seems to do it too often .
they just need to tone it down just a tad and maybe fill in a few spots with some personal logs about a mission or something related to her relationship with the crew or something .
the narrations do n't always have to be about thought provoking political ideals .
i complained in their forums that it did n't make too much sense to escape a planet going right upwards and that you could be in the atmosphere falling to the planet but one meter further you could be in the space floating forever .
someone told me they were n't going to implement the ksp orbits systems as it would n't be funny .
any he cruiser will have a field day with them i dont ' mind .
he 's got tons of personality and unique strengths in form of that huge s.b xx frametrap/grab meaty slam setups and armor on his cd too .
it 's so nice to see stories like this .
always brings a smile to my face if i 'm feeling a bit down .
i suspect she meant a cake made with dextrose or another sugar substitute .
it 's still stupid maybe she just does n't know how diabetes works ?
i expect you can probably guess almost all of these entrants but they 'll get a lot of social media 'hits ' from this .
if there 's genuinely a surprise entrant i expect they 'll just not announce that one on twitter have a silhouette or leave 1 or 2 spots blank
they do n't they power themselves through endless despair against humans no need for oxygen .
pretty sure nathan phillips was n't born before 1776 .
she 's my girlfriend and she 'll always be my crush .
because she 's gorgeous funny and has a beautiful heart .
do n't think i 'll ever stop getting excited when i see her name pop up on my phone let alone the unbridled excitement when i see her in person .
big match this spain needs to win to stay about scotland to remain in a good position for wrwc qualification .
being from scandinavia and using public transport anywhere outside it is not pleasant .
because a common refrain here and in the graun for example is that she only receives criticism for her words and actions due to her race not the fact she 's clearly perpetually confused .
men are more likely to be randomly attacked and killed why are you making it a gendered issue ?
the scary thing is he also earns about ¬£10 million from his personal sponsors on top of his mercedes contract .
that precision kinda reminds me about that story of senna when he hit the barrier and said that the barrier must have moved and everyone ridiculed him for it at first then people saw that it actually had moved a couple of centimeters
the dissolution of your country would lead to a civil conflict .
that was potentially one of the biggest reasons for the civil war .
refactoring the world 's idl to also emit events to the interplanetary blockchain is the consulting opportunity of this century .
dans quel magasin as tu trouv√© cette pizza circuit court ?
et puis m√™me si je ne d√©fends pas le magasin qui vend de tels produits il faut diff√©rencier le local du circuit court .
well you did ask me if i have a reason .
i see australia and canada as extensions of the united kingdom whereas i see america as a sort of demon child of the united kingdom .
i thought foward is the only good team from na and the current eg is tier 3
go to nakama.network and look for teams with the units you have
eh i 'm not saying i always do that 's kind of my point i 'd be a fool to think i have n't and still do n't do that .
i can be very prideful but i guess we all need to realize our flaws like that .
she already went to the tm community in iowa to ck out running for prez 2020
she already lost a congressional race years ago in california with only 13 of the vote
she preaches unconditional love ... based on the course of miracles
but is not unconditional ... she wants a woman president ! ! !
here is marianne williamson 's open letter to hrc saying she wants a woman president
she practices tm ... just like ivanka trump nice technique ... just avoid the dogma
i like her books ... but have seen her bully the living crap out of people
if she runs it will be to raise her profile sell books and expensive tours programs for rich people
her books are fine but saying you want a woman president when every woman senator voted to increase trumps budget ?
i saw that she was lurking around justice democrats when i was phone banking
long barell 1 and 2 are absolutely needed it 's so hard to 1-shot people with this gun and long barell 2 makes things easier even tho it does not work all the time .
i love this move for us especially if we extend him too .
both brands are good choices who find 'normal ' acoustics too big or thick-necked .
i think people should reach out to her the fact that she could already had committed suicide terrifies me

could send supplies for something your giftee makes or make them something .
or maybe if they 're interested supplies and instructions/lessons on how to make what you 're into .
it 's the first set ... she 'll work it out .
there 's no legitimate estimate for how much a person can store in ltm .
also measuring human memory in bytes makes no sense it 's measured in chunks .
even if trump tried to bring up taft hartley that would be even worse for him .
i assume the person who would have to whisper that into his ear would know not to do that .
he sure as shit isnt going to come up with it on his own .
does n't matter you do n't have enough amps to turn your engine over .
a tell-tale sign of that is if you hear rapid clicking when you try and start it .
and tbh what she said would piss me off of a guy said it too
i like napping so much that sometimes i dream about it
who is wondering why our divisional opponents hate us ?
hear me out on this one.. pineapple and jalapeno pizza .

i 'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say that the 20 games this season where he played like dogshit were due to his knees and this right here is the actual reke .
i would like to throw some together myself someday but i do n't have access to a machine shop and my experience is limited .
i think adapting a leica hektor 135/4.5 would be pretty easy with a scrap p67 lens my dremmel and some time .
i 'm still busy with season 2 but 5 of the next 8 chapters are already done .
if you think that 's bad you should see the stuff from the earliest sets .

yeah i 've been using mfp but really struggle not to undereat when i 'm tracking but i also struggle not to overeat when i 'm not !
i also do n't always trust the calorie counts so tend to overestimate just to play it safe .
thanks for the tips i 've been thinking about doing progress pics and whatnot but also want to get into a mindset of doing it for health in addition to aesthetic instead of the aesthetic being the ultimate goal .
i do n't care much but from the few things i 've seen this moment i do n't think the kids did anything wrong .
i do n't think they were harassing the guy nor intending to .
however they willingly went to a public demonstration imo the moment you decide to go to one of those things you 're consenting to being exposed to that kind of nasty stuff .
and they 're old enough to think about the consequences of their acts .
as truman said if you do n't like the fire get out of the kitchen .
it does n't help that the smiling kid has a douchey face .
aw ... you just replying even brought tears to my eyes .
the media is pushing an anti-trump agenda to reinforce the belief that he is somehow opposed to the nwo despite being surrounded by 9/11 conspirators and praising zionism

ah yes i remember doing this my freshmen year of college .
when the classes were so easy i could start the assignments a few hours before they were due and still finish them on time .
it 's been a while since i could start that late and still submit the assignment on time .

eh the fact that all the camillas are extremely diverse in playstyles while sharing the same movement type makes her emblem team actually more legit to use instead of being huge meme like lyn or lucina emblem .

i was getting a little lucky with whatever they changed masterwork cores to i do n't necessarily think that they need to remove them from the cost of infusing but they should lower particularly since it takes around 20 i think to masterwork something and then 2/3 to infuse it .
you need i think something like a minimum of around 130 to fully masterwork and upgrade your gear also assuming that you only have to infuse each piece once which does n't happen .
that 's ridiculous on a good week i can get around 20 maybe close to 30 cores .
also i have yet to masterwork a single armour piece since this new system by the time i consider it and have extra cores the damn cap raises again lol .
i just downloaded it this morning and i finished it an hour ago
but people refuse to accept the developers reasoning regardless so it does n't matter if it 's the truth because on reddit the downvote button is used for disagreement .
are we to accept the developers reasoning regardless and take what they say as obsolute truth ?
i mean he can say it 's about the server/community all he wants but they have already split the community with all the sharding and even introduced war mode to split us up even further .

my dad posts stuff like this on facebook sometimes .
one year on my birthday he posted one of my senior pics from high school and wrote a long post about how much he loved me and how proud he is of me .
i thought it was sweet though mildly embarrassing because of how thick he laid it on .
but it comes from a good place so it 's fine .
i only roll 10s when i 'm near my friend .
he 's so damn lucky at this game he did n't even know what a pity rate is .
the last 2-3 tens i pulled with him got me 5*s at 4 rate .
he started months after me has spent like 10 total and has 9-10 5 star adventurers .
i loved his episodes in season 4 as he got to work on some of the best on that season .

i never ever want to see replays of that game again .
i 'm concerned that you are switching jobs quickly i would consider why you are doing that .
is it that your current job does n't involve programming or that nothing at the company involves programming ?
with time and trust building could you eventually automate some of the work ?
i would give it at least 3 months before you decide .
in the meantime working at this company could provide you with valuable skills on the managerial side that you will need when you start a company .

however now that men are getting us to sign prenups intelligent women will avoid marriage because it does not make sense to sacrifice your time and money on pleasing a man who fails to provide you with financial security .
uh ... but you just said women acquired financial independence and men are useless to women .
prenups are dangerous because your husband could cheat on you with multiple women and you 'd still walk away from the marriage with nothing .

there is a considerable positive correlation between passports and obama voters .59 and a significant negative one .61 for mccain voters .
it appears that more liberally-oriented states are more globally oriented as well or at least their citizens like to travel abroad. ''
having a passport does n't mean one is necessarily traveling but lacking a passport definitely means one is not and i could n't find better data .

i used to play varsity tennis for my high school and my junior year i had to quit because of a problem with my shoulder .
before that i would play for upwards of 5 hours a day during the summer and 2 hours per day during the school year.i still do n't know how it happened exactly but every time i would extend my arm the shoulder would make a huge popping sound and hurt like crazy .
i was in physical therapy for a few months and it was apparently due in part to poor posture due to my super heavy backpack at the time .
once i got to college my posture improved dramatically and is now back to normal .
as far as i know i do n't think it included a look at my cervical spine .
my biggest growth spurt was probably actually this past year as well as one in like sophomore year of high school .
i think i 'm actually taller than 5 ' 7 '' now but i have n't been measured in a while .

i was thinking more that as the universe accelerates away from us any actions we take will never ever have an effect on an increasingly large volume of the universe .
there is this horizon beyond which our actions and causality will never have an influence .
for us it 's almost like those distant places are a separate universe but for beings existing between they may see both our actions and those of the distant place we can never interact with .

i dumped my ex and i 'm the one who initiated nc .
i have my moments ... some days i feel fine days like today i feel sad/hopeless .
i know i made the right decision by breaking up but i wish that things were different .
it 's a very long article disturbing to say the least '' so i 've post the first few paragraphs .
even before the skinny indigenous teenager was handcuffed and hurled into a fence at least six police officers were worried an innocent man had been arrested .
the man wanted for stealing a vehicle and ramming it into a police car was according to a description issued over police radio a 40-year-old aboriginal with a goatee .
the teenager splayed out on a pavement in heidelberg on the morning of april 5 2016 was also dark skinned .
but he was only 18 with a baby face and no facial hair .
tommy lovett had also committed no crime ‚Äì moments before his arrest he had been riding his scooter to his grandma 's house .
but by the time officers were directed to continue the search for the actual suspect lovett 's body was bruised grazed and bleeding .
a neighbour would later recall hearing him quietly sobbing on the footpath .
within hours his mother doreen would allege her son 's arrest was the result of racism and that he had been treated brutally by detectives .
police vehemently denied the claims and an internal investigation found nothing wrong with lovett 's arrest .
yet the age has uncovered diary notes and statements from officers at the scene that raise serious questions about the official police version of events and lovett 's handling by detectives .
among the files is a hand-scrawled diary note by a policeman who observed lovett 's treatment and described the incident as disturbing to say the least .
it 's interesting to hear diary notes and statements from officers at the scene are different to the official police version .
what will come of that i do n't know ...
i 've been booting from the ssd ever since i installed it .
boot manager used to ask which device to boot from every time the laptop turned on why is n't it asking now ?
i used a huawei p9 with stock chinese rom for 2 years and this had not happen to me for the whole duration .
i do n't know if they implemented the feature in a later emui version or in later models but as far as i know huawei phones deleting images from twitter is not something that should have happened in this world .
i 'm chinese so all my opinions are immediately invalidated for the indoctrination i received from the government .
edit the ui seems to be emui 5.0 or up .

yeah there 's a facebook group of users showing proof of the raffle winnings .
but even still if it was n't for the gift cards i would 've killed the app last year .
rather it 's legit on that end of things does n't matter much to me .
also occasionally i notice they give shit results for the free video rolls .
ie last year every hour you 'd get up to 6 rolls an hour just from videos .
not to mention the dq roll 's from tap/thermo survey 's .
not to mention buying those small 30 roll pick ups with google play credit from google opinions rack ups .
and the re-routing on tap/theromo is now throwing disqualified prompts and not getting any free rolls .
edit so what i do now with very dice is just hoard up all of the rolls then at the end of the month dump them out in one hit .
this month i 've slacked because of doing other things .
but i 've managed to rack off about 550 rolls .
last month i had about 2,000 just from the videos/survey 's then dumped it into a 20 amazon .

1v1 and small forum rps are good for adding in drama it keeps things fresh and new especially in slice of life type stories .
i though have found in mmo rp that drama can sometimes drag down a group/guild if there 's a major storyline going on .
now of course these storylines obviously have drama deafeat villain x solve murder protect and serve etc. .
drama that drags it down pertains to more petty things like ic relationships not getting what they want and overall just saying rude things to annoy people when it 's just out of place to do so .
it 's fine peppered here and there but when it 's becoming the sole focus it detracts from the storyline being presented .
anyone still in the white house at this point could hardly be called a bright mind '' .
it 's just something beautiful about a semi-forgotten educational movie from 20 years ago was mentioned on a popular podcast by a guest and then led to someone edit a scene in the same way as a scene from an anime because of both being about accepting their fate .
i just do n't understand how people watch this dude and see some of these throws he 's making and call him a system qb .
i personally like it clean as well but i see what the others are saying .
i guess it comes down to personal preference at the end .
this is why america needs to vote these people out of society .

if not monitored culture can become so saturated that it disappears into a bastardized shell of the native origins
do n't you people say it 's a good thing when that happens to white culture ?
on top of the helpful suggestions here cooking in bulk makes life so much easier .
you can freeze or refrigerate leftovers for another day when you 're too tired to go to the effort of cooking .
there are also lots of really nice 20-minute recipes with versatile ingredients i 'd highly recommend using those to save yourself time .
a couple of websites such as bon appetit also occasionally publish meal plans where they break down the exact groceries you 'll need for that week and each meal you can make from them .
it reduces waste and the mental load of planning everything yourself plus you can experiment with new easy recipes .

as a personal note i 'm a big fan of you and i really really admire your writing .
but even though this is good i felt it 's not really your best .
i wonder if they talk about it back at the settlement when you 're not around or are building .

ok. that 's another motivation to have a ltr which indeed has some lack of personal maturity .
yeah we were basically their project p such a tiny country managed to be the first world empire and avoid being conquered by spain .
i can imagine a game in the beggining of the age of discovery or when we achieved global colonization playing as an assassin conflicted by the fact that his nation is a templar creation but determined to save it and prevent world domination by the portuguese kingdom
not sure why he said north america when he clearly meant the us .
in canada they would still there after a month long no i insist you go first '' fight .
is n't the fw16 the car that senna and hill drove ?
hrm i must have missed the part where i called him elite .
let alone the part where he would have been buried on the depth chart and done zero to make us better if he was kept as rb was one of our few strengths in denver and pointed that he 's fortunate if anything about him being cut and finding his way onto a contender with multiple injuries at rb .
as well pointing at the other teams because they were the only teams he was actually on this season so if he was going to give anyone shit it should have been them .
but in all seriousness why would anyone use madden as a gauge for anything ?
cool but it looks like something out of a horror movie ...
my songs are definitely not pop they 're pretty out there .
i could share a private link to listen and you could see what you think ?
i legit would n't be able to take it not in a tiny cramped plane with no room to walk lie down or even stretch my legs .
i 'm getting anxious just thinking about it i 'm boarding a plane in 5 hours .
i think its reasonable to think that they payed their money so they 're entitled to play it however they want .
feel free to buy the game for them if you want a leg to stand on before criticising how they play it .
gold leader '' is kind of apt when describing him so it works in a way .
that 's really not how the sewage system works .
the water part once it 's been processed and disinfected does go back into the water system .
the sewage part is reprocessed into fertilizer http www.mwra.state.ma.us/03sewer/html/sewhow.htm .
we 'd be in a lot of trouble if all our shit was going into rivers and seas .
apparently celebrating a win with your own fans is seen as antagonising '' now .
now we know how to take her out lol .
jbo laver konstant den her slags kommentar jeg er sikker p√• at han ser noget sandhed i det men s√¶tter det med vilje p√• spidsen som en joke .
yeah lol such bullshit tho bc the original post was a repost as well
that does indeed say that the billionaires ' wealth is based on the forbes net worth list but it does n't say what the relationship between wealth and net worth is for everyone else .
that i because people are working without pay you should already know that .
you 'd be surprised how many you find by doing a random flamer sweep sometimes .
all i am saying is that he is n't playing the same position that he is considered world class .
and saying that he is n't playing his preferred position is accurate .
but for some reason the chelsea fans get real bent out of shape about it .
now when people try to blame the loss on kante playing out of position and what not that 's a different story .
but to say that he is n't the same player playing in his current role out of position is accurate .
save the td wins but a fg does n't win unless the other team has already had a chance to possess the ball in which case a fg actually does win unless the other team made a fg on its possession immediately preceding your fg in which case it does n't win it just extends the game '' overtime nonsense for the regular season .
a chance to play in the super bowl should n't come down to a coin flip .
play full overtime periods until there 's a winner once you 're in the playoffs .
make it 10 minutes instead of 15 if you 're worried about injuries or whatever excuse they have for this current format .
did n't realise why i did n't do it earlier lol
i 'd say it is plant precum as nectar contains no actual reproductive cells .
just accept the fact that you are in fact bad and figure out what you got ta do to improve .
he 's said on video he does n't care .
do n't remember which one but when carlton dude stated he was suing backpack kid came out saying the same .

my teacher said it was to give a positive impression rather than looking like a frown .
because you are not separate separation is an only deep-rooted mental concept which at its root has thoughts i am.. '' you are.. '' intellectual understanding is of little help here you would have to investigate to realize this but if a direct path is not for you then consider it scientifically .
when you see some other '' some distance away from you it is only your eyes processing sensory data but that is all happening within you similar with other senses what you think is external is happening within your consciousness you simply can not find an experience that is not happening inside your being therefore any implication of outside world and distinctions made are only mental .
it becomes very clear when you 've sat in silence for some time .
i had this insight once when i was deep in meditation thoughts were absent for a while and sound of birds appeared in my consciousness and to this experience thoughts like there are birds chirping out there '' were connected so i enquired about the nature of these thoughts and who is having them and when the thoughts were made absent then the sound was found to be appearing in my self only and it was obvious that birds are not separate from me only thoughts were giving this appearance .
i 'm a classic fan so of course i 'll play classic and if it is delivered well i 'm going to play it for a long time .
you either like it or not and well even with an all time low subscription count it is still doing well for itself all things considered if anything when i logged in this weekend i saw a bunch of servers being full or on high pop count ... so eh .
maybe it 's just your friends and reddit/forums people who you see complaining and the people who do n't visit these forums and are not on your friendlist still play actively i mean there are still championships for wow too ... .not every game can say that anymore ... .looking at you heroes of the storm ... . .
if they want to fix this game they have to do a clean slate restart ... .classic kind of does that..
others mentioned wow 2.0 ... that can be a solution sure .
sadly i as a vanilla fan ca n't really say much on the state of retail as i have too big of a bias towards the original expansionless game ...
not europe but it is a part of denmark .
they kept the red and white from denmark but made it their own and it 's also one of the more unique flags in the world .
everyone 's using stripes etc but greenland made something original .
if you really want to sell someone sell nurkic instead of blake blake is way better .
i am honestly not entirely following your way of thinking .
ultima online works like that because it was actually a quite successful game for its time and thus very well known .
plus it will need to keep beeing updated by the devs yes also the mod tools .
if they do n't give away the source code you ca n't have fixed and added everything through modders .
they 've had a playoff bye every year since 2010 nine in a row and had four more byes in the brady-belichick era before that ridiculous streak went to the sb all four times ... which is a playoff bye aka in the top two of the afc 13 out of 18 years which goes up to 13/17 if you do n't want to count the matt cassel year .
i mostly vape sub-ohm and had the same concern when i picked up my orion .
after tweaking its settings i found it to be surprisingly good .
i definitely prefer my sub-ohm tanks but the orion is clutch when i want something less clunky or leak prone to carry .
i know exactly what you mean i have the same problem with the 35mm film cels from the rebuild movies ! ! !
i would prefer meng huo but he is n't the most well known .
massive brigading the likes of which i have never seen on reddit .
it sounds like it 's going through a pretty big change so i would n't assume it 'll all carry over though i hope it does !
whats the worst government cover-up you have ever discovered ?
lmfao i spotted the 10 year old with 2 braincells
i like your writing style ca n't wait to read the rest üòÑ
i say ask her about the psych and build it into the anime convo if it goes there .
the one thing you need to do is seem like you 'are n't really interested ' if you catch my drift .
talk to her as a friend and stay in that mindset .

we are still planning our operations hence some minor errors in this post .
let me clarify for you and other reddit users .
we need unreal engine developers since our primary platform will be unreal engine however we may be using unity for other projects .
we are trying to create indie games for all to enjoy .
for this we require a multitude of skilled 3d artists 2d artists story writers and programmers .
currently we are using a system of junior/senior insert role .
the juniors are members of the team who are willing to learn a certain skill or multiple skills at once .
the seniors have mastered the said skill or have decent knowledge about the topic and teach juniors while also working on a selected project .
as this is a team of people who aspire to become developers there is no current compensation except for a finished project and gaining a following online .
so you were the guy that bought those nice track pants
i bought two t shirts an initial d framed puzzle and a fucking keyboard for some reason
i 'm upvoting all of the comments on this now .
the center looks like a muffin with eyes clapping .
depends on what i 'm craving on any given day really but i never go wrong with the bbq ranch salad or wrap .
i also really like the seasonal buffalo chicken salad which keeps getting brought back by popular demand 3rd season in a row .
if i get a wrap i always get it in honey wheat as opposed to white
yeah my bad thanks for pointing it out will change it commencing next week
i wonder of her doctors and insurance companies ever saw these posts and still rx and pay for her multiple wheelchairs ?
also saying no matter how badly your body is decimated '' it will grow back is stupid af .
if you have a spinal cord injury chances are that it may never get back to 100 .
its offensive and hurtful to say shit like that .
mostly i think because while she 's dancing around and doing stupid human tricks with her body she 's also pretending to be handicapped .
or maybe it 's just me who 's auper offended ?
idk it 's very risky bcuz mom watches her karma count and she uses new reddit vomit emoji
i 've been spamming oracle recently with great success just feels like i 'm doing so much damage in early fights .
just wanted to ask which of his level 25 talents do you prefer ?
i 'm struggling trying to kill champion gundyr just to get the titanite slab aldrich is gon na whoop me .
it did provide a certain level of excitement yet apprehension .
i have grieved more for the death of my pets especially dogs than any human family member so far .
it 's still appropriate depending on where you live .
i open carry in public if i 'm headed to an outdoor activity or sometimes the range .
jesus christ this is why people laugh at you neckbeards
as somebody else on this thread said yes yes yes '' !
i feel like the time jump will not be addressed virtually at all next episode but everyone on this thread has come to generally the same consensus there 's a good chance fiona and bill 's time jump will not have the exact same conditions as that of the original one but that one scene was hella important and it 's going to be brought up unexpectedly somewhere down the line .
the long corrador of spikes in the ground with the ones that shoot up in the middle .
there is no way to do it with out pogo .
you never said how you got through fungal wastes ?
no one on the internet can tell you when it 's supposed to happen '' .
your body is retaining water and at some point it will stop retaining water .
it 's about your average behavior over a very long period of time .
it 's good to collect data on your eating habits and body composition but being obsessed with the the scale moving is likely to to hamper your success .
for me it leads to well its not even working i might as well eat xyz '' ... .
stick to to your plan and accept that this may take longer than you want but it is a worthy endeavor nonetheless .
as a follow-up i left it alone for a couple of days skipping my normal daily cleaning and it seems to have settled down .
i had n't even gotten the chance to get saline before it seemed to be acting normally again .
i tested it tonight after a few days of no problems when cleaning with a flat-ended stone plug very slightly larger than the glass pair i had been wearing and they slipped right in with no irritation or swelling .
as always it seems patience the hardest ingredient was key .
i think the candyland minecraft had some good moments .
i remember him saying something along the lines of why are you talking to me ''
edit i should have read your replies before commenting .
lol yes if you were thinking of candyland that was it .
the aikikai has always maintained that he had his primary spiritual experience '' in 1925 although that causes some problems for their timeline .
actually he used that same spiritual language in the 1920 's and 30 's virtually unchanged from the language of the 1960 's .
where the translator 's went wrong is a big discussion but i 'll mention a few things .
one is that morihei ueshiba 's models for his spiritual and technical explanations were the same .
all of his technical language is include in the spiritual language but almost everybody misses that .
secondly many of the published translations are just wrong altered from the original and taken out of context .
third morihei ueshiba 's conception of peace and harmony '' comes from a very different cultural context it 's not what most folks make it out to be .
if you 're the server it 's a loss of first serve does n't progress .
if you 're the receiver i think it 's always a lost point ?
i visited your instagram i really like how you compose and expose your shots 1 follow
it 's a tough one but you can add flare something i found interesting is how substituting one word can change the whole tone of the longline so when you settle on a longline and get it too a good length try changing our words for synonyms and see how it affects the tone of what you are trying to say .
i think in general they need to balance the cost of creation vs destruction .
it takes too long to build a base or boat and it does n't take long enough to raid or sink them in general .
raiding is n't as easy as a lot of people seem to think you 'll need to either craft a bunch of explosive barrels or bring a tame carting a cannon to break into even the most basic of stone bases .
if you do the former you 'll need to make sure you have enough even just being 1 barrel short can completely thwart your raid and if you do the latter you risk your tame being killed by one guy with fire arrows completely thwarting your raid .
raiding in general is in favour of the defenders the only time they 're ever not at an advantage in a raid is if they have zero players online and no allies to help .
you only need one person in a locked room upstairs to completely stop raiders declaiming your base regardless of how outnumbered you are .
seriously it 's not that hard to recruit foreign players or introduce yourself to some neighbouring companies based in a different timezone and make an agreement to look after each other 's bases .
i do n't think it 's fair to remove what i and surely many others consider to be a good feature of the game simply because a few other people are unwilling to work with it .
i was working hospitality for the ao over the last few years and certainly people tended to complain about the water i refunded a couple out of the hundreds that we sold but i 'd never refunded a bottle of water when we were stocking mt franklin in the years prior .
i 'll concede that most australians would not perceive most of their chinese products as dirty the perception may be that the products are n't as good which i think is less true than it used to be but i do n't think that the perception of chinese products as dirty extends to things that we are n't eating and drinking .
wow thanks your litteraly the first one to answer my questions lol but yea idk how people can go to festival and shit on mdma i just wan na lay down and cuddle everyone ahah
i can tell when my stress is taxing my meds to their breaking point when i feel i want to cry for no real reason .
dog food commercial with cute puppy ? time to tear up !
remembering a movie where a character was mean to an animal ?
who cares that it 's a fictional act ... better tear up !
i absolutely love the art style and concept in this game .
i hope the final product has a focus on experimentation and discovery !
i think adding a cultivation aspect to break up the pure experimentation part would really add to the experience .
i also hope you have a plan for good music to go with the game because i feel good in game music can make or break a game 's mood .
i feel like some lutes or harps would do wonders for this type of game .

we did n't want to waive him because we 'd be on the hook for his salary .
a fucking lie is what they called it in as .
try using a blank notecard to cover the rest of the problem and only focus on the one operation or step that you are on .
sometimes my students ' brains are already on the next step while they are writing the previous step and make careless errors .
haha i 'll have to weigh the options ca n't be any worse than the tane lol
it almost looks like it teleported to the other side of the screen it was heading left when diddy got hit .
there is absolutely nothing i wouldnt do for a massive amount of money ie 100 mil
i play whichever team i like i do n't care if the community likes it or not .
it 's really fun for me and helps out a lot so tell me now why do n't i deserve that rank ?
because a bunch of top tiers are on that team ?
that does n't matter to me i 've been playing gotenks since i got the game and knew nothing vegetto i always wanted to play and bardock i find fun .
i think it was more about the offensive line and his lack of weapons .
when taysom hill is your fourth best option there 's a problem .
ahh god i remember building giant ass villager breeders and having a cult of villagers .
see what makes feminism so unattractive for men is things like this where supposedly our issues ca n't matter because women have it so much worse .
being concerned about men being falsely accused and women being raped are not mutually exclusive .
obviously i am concerned about women being raped and i have considered different ways to help the issue myself .
however i found you insinuating that false accusations are practically nonexistent to be pretty ignorant so i provided some statistics .
a lot of people wanted it on switch and given that the switch is still hot at the moment the longer they go without putting metroid on switch in some capacity the risk is increased .
make a lbg build around stickies or even better make the dark devoured and build around ko sticky and cluster and you 'll find kush a lot easier .
also gem in vitality for the extra health boost .
if the pace is so slow we are most definitely gon na lose
that 's why i 'm alive maybe next time you 'll have a better shot !
that 's the nicest thing anyone 's ever said to me ... .you know i want to share something with you i have n't told anyone ok here it goes 6 years ago i was babysitting ... part 1/78 .
to all the other big tiddy goth girls reading this i 'm also single and lonely .
the way i thought about it is that people love themselves so much that when they have a child they see it as the most beautiful thing in the world because it came from them !
he had a killer match with morishima with that injury in his eye .
badass af also stupid but still mad respect for db
if they see a cup with one in it they 'll do everything they can to knock it over .
for the us packs there 's really only 2 slots out of 9 1 energy that has a chance of being a good card .
you definitely have the cute part down i 'd love to find out about the slut part together
after talking to a few of them i think the lack of a super bowl is indeed the root cause .
on another note i do feel like reddit has some of the worst members of representative fanbases .
so maybe we 're just getting exposed to a small sample size and generalizing based on that .
i would tell them as soon as you start training in order to give them as much time as possible to plan for your absence .
you should also contact your benefits team to understand your options .
you will be protected by california pregnancy leave laws but not by fmla so you should start preparing to understand your benefits and income options sooner rather than later .
there are some unscrupulous people out there but by and large in california you 'll find people are grateful you gave them time to plan .
your light source is coming from the right so you could make more of that and make the shadows longer and darker the sun would likely be lower in the sky .
edit and maybe darken the left side of the trees with a blue/brown wash atm your left sides of the trees look lighter than the right sides but your shadows are on your the left .
with the way we kick problems down the road i 'm surprised we do n't just use it and let our great grandkids clean it up .
there was a video i watched of a rabbi talking about ghosts before but ca n't remember the full content i just remember what he said about apparitions of the dead showing up to people to finish what they need to or something like that
yeah and maybe this is nitpicking but i was hoping it would have a longer shape i.e. neck out and wings spread like the got dragon rides .
today was the first day that my voice is normal and i 'm not coughing up a lung .
my question is if over 50 people with around 17 wins are playing after 12p.m .
e why would n't they have a harder time all getting into the top 100 ?
and why would players that have like 10 wins and dont play as well being playing at that time if they dont have as much of a stake in winning ?
i would tell him that i love him so much .
also if he needs anything or if he 's in pain or not feeling well to point at what he needs or where the problem is .
and if he learns to look both ways before crossing the street and avoid cars then i 'd let him play outside with the neighborhood cats but only if he comes home when i 'm there .
i know which one but i 'm reasonably certain they ate ss wire and also looked around online and dont see that either like i hate to come off as an ass so please dont take it that way but can u snap a pic of the box saying that ?
because nothing anywhere i found at least says it and i 'd love to see it for myself
i mean doesnt hardin count as a non-european design ?
dayan is probably my favourite design in the game actually .
tomorrow we 'll see the front page multiple thread bill gates circle jerks 'he 's just like us ! '
if you do n't think bill gates and his ilk are the problem then you are the problem .
what i like about the rat 2 is the pure look and the way it performs as well as the size .
the tenacious is an ok starter spyderco and starter knife .
what i like about it is how sharp it comes from fabric and how easy is to resharpen .
in my opinion the tenacious is a little small for me but i still love it .
it is up to you wether to choose one of these two or find a different option

in college i used an empty absolute bottle for storing drinking water .
the cold glass made the water taste so good especially when you wake up all hungover from boozing too much the night before .
one day my roommate thought it would be hilarious to refill it with vodka .
i woke up the next morning after a hard night 's drinking with that pasty cottonmouth feeling and stumbled to that delicious bottle of cold water .
i did n't even realize it was vodka until about the fourth or fifth big gulp .
it 's actually quite cold here by vegas standards .
honestly her hair makes her look like an american girl doll and i think that has something to do with it lmao

what i do recall is that star wars was initially a limited release to just a small number of theaters nationwide just 40 total ? ...
and this was after time magazine dedicated a major chunk of their weekly issue to it which really built the hype .
i was living in the dc area at the time and the only theater that was showing it was the uptown theater in 70mm with dolby stereo .
read the following for a sense of how crazy it was back then the movie that ate cleveland park https www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1977/06/23/the-movie-that-ate-cleveland-park/494f67a6-40b5-45b4-968c-807a5bf61c57
all told i watched it in about a dozen different theaters but the best by far was the spectacular uptown theater .
is it possible you 're just not attracted to good guys ?
you 're giving chances '' but are you giving them chances to be likeable or chances for you to like them ?

yea man honestly i 'm glad i read your whole story i looked up other reddit posts about waiting and i saw a few that were like ‚Äò when i tell a guy i 'm not ready it 's just a polite way of saying i 'm not interested ' and like it kinda made me feel bad about it but after reading yours i was like bro this is literally my situation .
i realllllly feel deep down one day it 's gon na work .
she will not say she 's not interested it 's just the fact she can not which i respect .

were n't nordic countries labelled as social democracies and not democratic socialist which are completely different labels ?
the nordic model refers to the economic and social policies common to the nordic countries ... ..
they note that even in the scandinavian countries social democracy has been in decline since the weakening of the labor movement..
it 's cause she probably literally never says anything mean about anyone or anything crass about colton 's sexiness '' or vcard '' .
basically she has class and therefore provides no usable soundbites .

so you saw a cute girl assumed without knowing her or ever talking to her that you could get her number gave away where you live on reddit due to the fact that you think based on the way she looks she would be on a particular part of a particular website and thought she would know you were talking about her once she who definitely sorts by new on this part of this website saw this non-descriptive post ?

i 'm probably focused on the wrong thing here but was there just some random dudes hand in the frame at 23:20 to the right ?
i knew i 'd seen that thing before ! ! ! !
i was a tiny one in the 80 's and i had one of these ! ! !
so are you having trouble finding just the area of any deformed part ?
because you can check the normals and see if they 're pointing a certain direction so that you can tell if it 's deformed or not .
i enjoy games that i can play with my friends better honestly .
but everything i play is also on the pc .
i resent the people who set the system up that way .
i resent the people who teach to judge not by the content of character but the color of skin .
i resent the ignorant people who think they know everything and like to lord over others from their ivory towers .
i resent a lot of things but that does nothing for me .
sadly nothing i say or do will ever get through to people like you who are so set in the belief that people are what they are and ca n't change .
somebody could use that on me as a pick up line and it would work .
i do n't see why u hate on this guy ?
you beat the guy and he did n't have a single chance with all his stars .

virtual machines access the host 's hardware directly which relies on the host and guest having the same cpu architecture .
emulators on the other hand basically implement hardware in software .
literally had a kid on the other team say i give tf up '' after going down 1-0 with over 2 mins still left and he quit and went to siege and he was on xbox lol

joe relied too much on his offense to cover up his defensive holes .
if he somehow survives early he 'll dominate late though .

this game strays far away from soulsborne games based on what is currently known about the game in the wrong direction .
yeah i could name myself after winnie the pooh .
they literally have completely different playstyles darryl is supposed to sneak up on other players and charge at them to deal a ton of damage while bull is supposed to wait for other people to get close to him so he can destroy them in seconds
ah thanks that looks like a good one with lots of info .
missing bullet velocity over range but otherwise looks very useful .
i see they note the patch version and date from which the data comes from in the footer too which is very helpful .
it seems like this conversation is almost impossible to have these days .
it was very clever to preempt the right 's observation of these parallels by hurling the nazi '' term at them early and often .
it would not only bring in huge wave of toxic players
now with 5 less umgak you want to play the skaven ?
in all seriousness it 's a bad idea that fatshark has no interest in .
the whole game would need to be rebalanced around the pvp minority .
there are actual trump avatars in vr chat and they are as freaky as you imagine them to be .
it was actually a john oliver bit if you want to search it .
my gf is doing a phd in agriculture and organic rules can be fairly odd sometimes .
i also was chatting to a guy who roasts coffee beans and does n't have the fair trade label and he was complaining about how it does n't actually help the farmers .
it 's just become this commodity for companies to have .
so he has a personal relationship with where he gets the beans from instead .
it 's like that story about in order to deal with certain wastes countries were just sending them to places where it 's okay to burn all the rubbish .
so one country gets to say it is n't burning the waste but in the end all the waste is burnt anyway .
at work atm so people will have to do their own digging to find more information .
but there 's literally hundreds of these sorts of stories .
public perception of how green '' or fair '' your produce is is quite obviously more valuable to a company than actually doing it .
i prefer to sit in first class in the front row with a window seat ! ! !

to make a few more points on this story she has to cut the hair on my balls too .
i get its just cosmetic but it does still piss me off .
i bought it a month ago and have to spend more money .
i honestly would n't mind if i just instantly got all the goodies on purchase .

they can ban people who used a cheat engine to get in but not everyone with the helmet or paladin paint or whatever .
lots of innocent people have it now that have no clue it 's not in game and never had anything to do with exploitation .
bethesda would be really stupid to get ban happy .
lose a lot of future customers and it makes them look foolish .

it 's really just an overview of a language from different aspects phonology morphology syntax you know the drill .
the course requires us to find and submit the name of a comprehensive reference grammar '' and i know mine is not enough that 's really it .

the point of amtgard generaly is n't to be in a story but instead run around hitting people .
which is freakin fun but definitely makes one pause to call it a larp .
he 's been given 150 pages to finish the arc in a proper manner which is a bit under the average length of the pre shogun assassination serious arcs .
and he 's been given over 4 months to work on those 150 pages much more than he 'd have on a weekly magazine .
i 'm sure he 's had enough time to properly plan how to end it properly .
you keep trying to protect yourself under the guise that you like pacquiao more than floyd and it 's irrelevant .
the problem is that you 're taking all these unfair judgements of fighters into consideration when making your own .
she is the queen therefore she gets the best our country has to offer in terms of food healthcare ect .
i keep clicking into your rant threads assuming one will eventually be well thought out and formatted and every time i 'm disappointed .
it 's raining or horrible weather more often than not so i 'd never have a chance to open the roof without also turning the car into a swimming pool .
then he would have to look away from the game and even if it 's just a split second it 's many split seconds over the duration of a game where he 's not looking at the game .
the cognitive load should also be lower since he can completely disregard his spartial awareness .
the other guy is also their strength and conditioning coach and during the game he has nothing else going on .

even without a patch a plug will hold well enough to not cause a catastrophic failure .

i go on vacation to a different country every year and have had lots of sunwing vacations .
i 've never experienced a bad vacation from any of the airlines .
sunwings champagne service is a joke but it sounds good in the commercials .
you get an ounce of box champagne in a plastic cup but their vacations are still enjoyable .
also the cockpits are much much more secure these days .
after 9/11 aircraft doors became much more secure strong enough to withstand small arms fire and grenades .
this is the only response to 9/11 that has made any sense .
gap was exploited gap was identified gap was addressed and done away with .
everything else since has been one nightmare after another .

yikes ... .it was n't anywhere near like that !
i did n't remove friends from the list they moved on since i was no longer gino good times like i was when i was single .
maybe you can relate to it phrased like this you 're out at the club getting drunk and if you 're like me you tend to get a little show-y when you drink .
well some of that attention gets spread around on the crew or it did when i was out and about .
once the showboat stopped showing the attention dried up so did the extra dick that was being tossed their way ... .so they scooted on .
i was accused of being selfish when we started dating because i was n't thinking about what my relationship did to their hookup life .
i know several folks in the last year have posted ‚Äòwhat cis folk should know about transness ' and gotten some good responses .
well maybe not the greatest expert out there but i have a knowledge above the average .
i consider that the most of the contradictions are not contradictions .
the most of them are misunderstandings in the meaning .
when you read carefully you see there are not contradictions .
tell which one are you interested in and i will respond .
bruh the timed shit from this year is also 2k ooh yeah understand now haha d
i agree mostly about everything except i dont think ohm is their best album.to me fs or bssm
i do n't know why people still go to gamefaqs boards .
they 've always been a breeding ground for cynicism and completely irrational behaviour .
i ca n't see the game while reading them all .
a small thing but if i 'm a fisherman why does just whacking the water with a rod generate money ?
there is a whole separate mini game to actually get a fish which seem odd .
i just got a pop up asking do you want to try tax frauds '' with a yes or no .
there is no explanation for me to evaluate the risk and reward .
is it a 10 chance of increasing profits by 100000 50/50 chance of being caught ect .
what happens if i get caught and so on .
also do you want to try tax frauds '' is n't grammatically correct in english .
i think a better question would be do you want to cheat on your taxes ? ''
those bubbles move too quick on such a small game window
i got a window asking if i want to employ my employees illegally but i do n't appear to have any employees .
again no idea what the actual pros and cons are .
buying upgrades is a bit fiddly and the costs are way too high to the return in per second eg to buy my 3rd understanding the world of fish ... ... ... .. '' will cost 9600 and only make 5/s so it will take 1920 seconds to make a profit or a little over 30 mins .

i 'm sorry if i come across of just shitting on your shit but i hope the feedback helps .
i do n't think you 're a monster steam giveaway either .

water has to include azumarill surely one of the best pvp pokemon in the game .
yeah they created plenty of weird shit for this movie mostly backwards driving cars like a renault nevada amc pacer peugeot 404 wagon etc .
you can have a look at the imcdb page for the movie .
you can see him break and smile a bit at 2:13 .
yeah you should use that usb connection to keep the receiver as close to your mouse as possible ideally 6-12inches away .
if you just plug the receiver directly into your mobo you have a larger chance of getting some interference from other nearby devices or your router .
likely you will have no issue either way but it is meant to be used .
its a sport that i enjoy in game and out of game .
unfortunately they ruin it for me by these exploits like humans ruin everything .
i honestly wish this game was more japanese as people would n't do this in their culture .

congratulations you must be way more skilled than i am .
i personally feel that trying it at the end of the season would put too much pressure on individual games .
i can perform very well when i do n't really feel the pressure but when i put too much importance on the outcome of the match loss of points possibly even my streak instead of just doing the best i can in the match itself i tend to start playing worse .
mario party 5 is chaos purified into board game form .

guns are almost never used here and that is good .
but fuck if you are going to fire warning shots you need to follow up on that also .
i can kind of understand trying to arrest the person as peaceful as possible .
but the moment he attacks someone sitting in a car there you are putting others in danger by not jumping on him with 3 persons and beating him to the ground .

i ca n't really speak to that from a personal level .
my most recent black ancestors are from the 19th century so i do n't relate directly to the culture .
i would imagine that they might want to connect to an identity that extends beyond just american since there is so much historical trauma in the black american identity .
this is all pretty speculative though as i 'm not black .
then i sat down and thought about what is important to me what virtues i value etc .
it 's kind of hard to not like kindness love dignity wisdom creativity intelligence enjoyment and boobs .
i mean i bet if you sat down and thought about it you could come up with some things you could value .
if you value those things then you can make those things your purpose .
but yeah they probably tried to sell op a trial key at full price .
the problem is that the fire marshal wo n't allow them .
although the last time a student was harmed in a school fire was in the 1950 's and the last time a student was assaulted at an school was last week .
when did they claim it was to increase variety specifically ?
the motto of the change was create your own playstyle '' .
and i know i am on the minority that went deep on the old runes to check playstyles while other just went armor yellows mr blues with ad or ap '' .
i saw many playstyles people used different combinations some adc used for example as blues others used a combination of as and mr other scaling mr others even mana regen .
i myself was main adc before and i actually had around 6-7 rune pages for adcs .
i learned from lemonnation to use gold/5 yellows and played almost the same as the full gold supports during ardent meta .
as well as many different pros i also saw using their own combination of runes .
nowadays we only have the new runes that i myself still call masteries because this is what they are .
and they bring as same different playstyles as the old masteries but now we ca n't choose runes as well .
the problem was that them costing ip everyone prioritized heroes .
that way no one actually had the energy runes to test .
why would i use 3200 ip on runes to use on a single champion while i can use the same amount on runes that work on every champion or on an actual champion ?
a lot of people talked about energy runes as memes and what they even are for ? '' .
i put my bet that if they just kept old runes but made them free some random player would find a viable build with energy runes or any other rune just like lemonnation used gold/5 runes for passive supports and also other players used mana blues with blitz others used gold quints and etc ...

i quit overwatch and switched to paladins shortly after bridget came out .
my moba addiction went from league of legends to overwatch to paladins .
which means we get an unlimited amount of play styles and strategies .
while every tracer in overwatch pretty much plays the same .
sniping is much better in paladins as well as assassins .
the maps have better areas for snipers to perch and assassins to hide .
i like adapting to the opponent through buying items instead of the character switching roulette you get in overwatch .
there are a lot of paladins characters that i really love the personalities of .

if i remember correctly in the early 2000s he got moved from the afternoon show to mornings on nrk .

this was mid high school for me then a couple years later in college i heard he was doing a show on ufo that was pretty tame and straightforward probably heavily supervised .

i 've been using blender 3d professionally for four years .
i 've supplemented it in high-poly/high-fidelity 3d work with zbrush but if you 're just looking to create low-poly characters you can use blender 's sculpt mode '' to refine your blocky meshes a bit if you 'd like .
but long story short blender 3d is the way to go for free 3d software .
it 's somewhere in the top 100 along with it 's ok to be white '' but it 's definitely below this recent scandal kavanaugh or the rolling stone rape article .
with respect to the many denominations one reason that 's true is because christianity is not a monolith .
protestants at least do not have a single ruling body or individual so nobody makes the rules '' for everyone .
for myself i have been a member of many churches in many places over the years one feature of military life so i 've had the opportunity to experience many different teachings .
in the end however i rely on my own reading of the bible to evaluate all of them .
i try to read all the way through it every few years .
one thing i have found in my reading is that there are some ideas that are expressed very consistently throughout the bible and leave little room for creative interpretation if we are honest .
others are put forth more fleetingly and perhaps can be interpreted .
in my reading i look first to see what the text plainly says .
i then see what other parts of the bible speak to the same idea and see if there is correlation .
often times the correlation of the idea builds into a larger theme to the extent that the idea is inescapable .
to use the terms intelligence analysts use i might say that i conclude that doctrines are biblical at varying degrees of confidence '' .
for example i conclude with low-to-moderate confidence that early baptisms were conducted in a certain way .
i my confidence is n't very high because i find that if i change certain assumptions i can support alternate interpretations that also seem reasonable to me based on the scripture .
the bible is unrelenting in its central tenets for example that jesus ' death on the cross was a historical fact that it was effective in saving god 's people from their sins and that he then rose from the dead to break death 's power over humankind ... these are clearly central themes of scripture .
i believe they are faithful interpretations of the bible with extremely high confidence .
when it comes to the issue of gender and sexuality very few serious christians that i know place much importance on the story of sodom as conclusive .
it is a historical story out of which one might take several lessons .
the bible speaks much more plainly about sexuality in other places but these places are many and consistent .
that god clearly created us in two beautifully complementary genders from the beginning is clear consistent and repeated throughout scripture in a variety of ways .
add to this that homosexuality is consistently spoken of as a perversion of god 's design not just in exodus and leviticus but also in the new testament romans and 1 timothy for example and you have an inescapably clear teaching .
as to the question of promotion it has not been my experience that promotion boards look with any particular favor on people who attend church .
making it up to lt col tends to be something that most people can accomplish as long as they follow a suitable career path ... that is check the required boxes '' so to speak .
making colonel is rather more difficult very few officers ever become generals .
i ca n't remember ever attending church with any of my supervisors throughout my career and i do n't think many of them actually went to church at all .
in fact my christianity may have represented more of a risk than a reward in my career though i ca n't think of any time it was used against me openly except for the one example i gave initially from when i was an e-5 .
i realize much of what i have said above is probably not welcome but i 'm trying to shoot you straight .
it 's an ama so i want to keep it real .
you 'll of course have to change the routes etc .
one thing to keep in mind though is that the ipsla here really is only concerned with getting pings back .
if you want to actively use all three isps you 'll probably want a different config .
seems like it should work not sure how it handles one of the upstreams going down .
probably good but you 'll likely want to do some testing .
because if you induce vomitting you force it through your throat again .
then it gets a second chance at attacking all the sensitive things there .
the digestive system is much more capable of dealing with acids etc .
depending on what is in your cleaner your stomach can actually handle it
i have n't heard yet but it ca n't be that bad as people been saying .

i assume it 's because they have to load and keep track of 4 characters instead of 2 which i assume takes almost twice the memory .
though i never really understood what it is about fighting games and their textures weighting so much when all they do is literally render two active characters on the screen in a relatively small stage .
this is all super helpful i actually found your blog about a week ago and bookmarked it to read !

navi is much cheaper to make but it is more expensive than polaris about 50 higher bom if my estimates are accurate .
the available bandwidth for once should be sufficient so we keep the scaling of radeon vii as a baseline .
add in a few other enhancements and you have a chance of hitting 15 over a reference vega 64 at a low cost .
navi only needs to be 8 better per cu than vega ... but vega already does worse than polaris per cu so that 's almost a freebie .
yeah that 's not right if you do it wrong .
i do all the dishes until randomly my housemate decides to wake up and clean everything in sight every 4-5 months .
i then have to re wash every fucking dish because he thinks it 's fine to just put the pan full of solidified grease into the same sink full of water he uses to wash everything .
which just coats everything in a layer of grease then puts them all away so everything that contacts them also needs to be washed .
when confronted with this he responds with a little grease never hurt anyone . ''
fucking do things right or do n't do it at all you just make more work for me later .

i had some tactile sensory issues as a kid and hated layers so much i could barely wear a cardigan over a thin t-shirt imagine trying to shove me into a corset at that age !
i can see how some kids would find them incredibly uncomfortable .
as for adults a well-made and well-fitted corset of the correct shape should be comfortable barring any mental or physical ailments .
but they either were n't aware of this at the time or did n't care much .
corset shapes were based on what was currently in vogue rather than what would fit an individual woman 's body .
conical corsets can be extremely uncomfortable if you have a broad ribcage for example yet all women were expected to wear them for a period of time .
this probably contributed to the mixed reports about how un/comfortable corsets were even among adult women .
for a modern parallel we can read the thousands of posts online today about how painful and uncomfortable bras can be .
most women have no idea how to choose the correct shape and size bra or where to shop from they just grab one that seems to kind of fit because they were told during puberty they had to wear one from now on .
just b/c something can be comfortable on most people does n't mean we should pressure everyone into wearing it of course .
i would never want to go back to an era where this level of restriction is a social requirement .
even bras are a bit much when you really think about it .

someone who 's gon na be financially irresponsible with their last 1k is probably going to blow it one way or another

people who participate in forwarding reddit 's narratives and agendas ?
that looks like it might be a food mart .
it 's just the show mentions that congress white house and court were killed so i would n't be surprised if maybe there was one survivor and that survivor became president and created gilead .
not every senator or rep or cabinet member attends every session .
i mean during the kavanaugh vote they even said that one senator could n't make it because he was walking his daughter down the aisle so maybe it was similar circumstances .
like oh senator is busy so he could n't come today !
oh no ! i would think they 'd be a member of the supreme court since they 're supposed to know the constitution inside and out so the person in charge can easily suspend the constitution on this and this principle .
hey everybody blames marilyn manson for columbine but the truth is that the kids hated his music so i would n't be surprised if maybe gilead 's creators hated pence because maybe he did n't conform to the standards they wanted or disagreed with him too much .
i always view the sons of jacob as a political group like an alt right tea party or green party like a small minority nobody noticed but still existed or this worlds scientology so i would n't be surprised if perhaps if pence existed in that world they disliked him or viewed him a suppressive person .
that 's so difficult ... especially if you love someone and you really want to get help getting unstuck .
i would say try and work that nhs system and think about your own struggle with depression ... it 's so hard to get yourself motivated to do stuff exercise eating right etc .
and trying to get someone else to do it who is really not interested ! ? ! ?
i wish a pair of running shoes and ten push-ups every morning would help you here but i think it 's more complicated than that ...

natalie i just think you and her are like oil and vinegar .
if he did n't want to participate he should have either rejected the invite or spoken to you before hand and come to an agreement maybe to come after the haggadah instead but he did n't .
why did he agree to go if it was against his beliefs to participate ?
also as you pointed out other people of different religions also participated .
i find it childish and rude that he 's planning to attend and not read rather than not go .
sure maybe the first time he did n't realize that passover dinner carries actual religious significance and is n't just a fancy dinner with a religious title .
he knows now and in planning to do so again is being disrespectful .
maybe this passover suggest he comes after the haggadah ?
i am probably a bit biased since i 'm jewish but passover is n't a holiday you just sit on the sidelines for .
it 's about coming together and celebrating each other and everything .
him not participating feels to me like him not wanting to be part of the family .

you conflate outlawing abortion with making organ donation mandatory obviously thinking that pro-lifers can not draw a distinction between them and that if they want one the second inevitably follows .
this is wrong because we can distinguish between basic and extraordinary care .
basic care is always obligated extraordinary care is not .
a mother with no option to feed her baby apart from her breastmilk can be compelled by law to breastfeed even if she does not wish to .
failing to do so to the point of harming a child can be prosecuted as neglect .
we can not compel her to donate a kidney though since that would be a direct attack on her bodily autonomy whereas preventing her from getting an abortion is preventing her from directly attacking the right to life of her child .
yes but he spent real actual money on jimmy graham last year so ... ..
life per hit is a primary attribute life per kill is a secondary attribute .
there are more good primary attributes you would rather want than life per hit on amulets thats usually crit chance crit damage and either 20 element damage or 8 cooldown reduction depending on build .
for secondary attributes you usually want physical resistance or another kind of resistance or 7 reduced damage from meele/ranged attacks .
life after each kill is n't useless but it is n't very valuable either .
you can get life per hit on gloves rings amulet helm bracers and weapon .
gloves rings and amulet can have super valuable affixes like crit chance crit damage attack speed cooldown reduction area damage resource cost reduction and for amulets also element damage .
you would n't want to sacrifice these for life per hit .
helmet can give other desirable affixes such as crit chance skill damage mainstat vitality life which is n't worth sacrificing for life per hit helms gloves and weapons also give up to 1000 mainstat and vitality
where you do want life per hit is one weapon if you 're not using two-handed weapon and sometimes also on bracers .
in builds with high attackspeed life per hit may be the primary tool for surviving .
unless you are using a build where life after each kill boosts an ability e.g .
certain healing abilities or dh passive leech '' you do n't need life after each kill .
if you think about it like this when you fight enemies you hit them many times resulting in a lot of healing with life per hit when you kill enemies you only get healed once by life per kill .
also healing is more needed when you fight enemies than when they have already died .
yeah i 'm trying to get into meal prepping to save money .

if they got married in the last 5 years there 's a 90 chance they use a picture of them in a wedding dress .
but with the courts being able to function only till the 31st and opening the government seems unlikely until then arguments are n't going to happen very soon .

it should n't even be a question to ponder upon imo .
the court should 've done the same thing here what they did with daca .

well there was a police investigation that lasted months and found no evidence .
so no evidence coupled with her history of lying drug abuse and proof she was n't scared '' after sending text messages bragging about sleeping with enzo which did not line up with her statement that she was fearful and escaped the room .
you say he 's lying about not knowing but where 's your proof he 's lying ?
you 're accusing him of something you just think he is lying about .
and lying to your employer if he did about being accused of something you claim you did n't do is n't far fetched .
when you are in the public eye just an accusation can ruin your life .
if you 're accused of rape you will be a rapist for the rest of your life .
these are facts i was just trying to provide an example that the br genre is n't defined by inventory management .

a move that has little to no risk and high reward for example warden sb can be delayed so that 's a 50/50 she can also faint into gb so another 50/50 on your side if you get hit she gets a top heavy and can just repeat the same thing then you have conq bash which is if you are close to him is unreactable and if he 's away he can delay or just gb you which gets him either a light or a heavy no risk he can then repeat by chain then there is orochi which has fast lights and unreactable zone also he can back dodge top heavy which there is no risk since he can faint berserker can faint his heavy into light it 's a 50/50 and one afther another you ca n't gb or poke him so thats most of your deffence gone then there is shinobi which this requiers some skill so it 's not as cheap but still bs he can if he knows how get a faster but riskyer warden situation then there is shaman with zone soft faint into bleed also all the moves that do n't attack you '' so you ca n't block like raider shugo shaman lb this is only used in dominion do you get the idea now ?

i recently played the metro games and fell in love .
i 'm even tempted to read the books and i hate books .
i hope this will be the next witcher 3 when it comes to success .
real lpt hospitals treat you and get you out as quickly as they can .
do n't expect any patient to be there long enough to sleep let alone overnight unless they admit you for something serious which is less likely than many think .
even if you are actively ill vomiting in agonizing pain and too weak or unwell to walk let alone care for your sick self at home afterwards expect to be wheelchaired to the exit and dumped there as soon as the hospital is willing to bet you 'll live out at least the night once they walk away and leave you alone outside in winter possibly incapacitated and likely suffering and for all they know or care without any way to get home .
whatever high healthcare standards you hope to encounter when you need care in the us picture your hospital is inside a time bubble and that your hospital actually exists in the dark ages .
this should help to adjust your expectations to be more like what you would actually encounter if you go to the hospital or take someone there .
i have chronic illness so unfortunately i 've gotten to be all too familiar with the hospital patient experience .
the too specific bits toward the end of the first paragraph were part of my most recent experience a few days ago .
one time i came across a player who did n't know what they were doing not this bad but when he was on my team i tried to stick with him
we have a black kitty and when she 's had enough pets you bleed .
do you want be be a part-time full-time landlord ?
buying renovating and renting properties can be very stressful very time consuming and can end up being loss making .
you have as much rights as he does when releasing the bond .
if you do n't want to sign an amended bond disposal form contact the whichever agency holds the bond for you and escalate accordingly .
you should have received confirmation of accepted bond at the start of your lease that would have you id number on it for reference .
i gave an old gatorade bottle i use for color changes filling the cup and pouring out then spraying out till clear for color changes but tbh i have to disassemble and clean probably every time i use it .
that being said after three years i can disassemble clean ultrasonic cleaner reassemble in less than five minutes and that 's ring really slow .
if i were in a rush i could just clean the tip ... ..but i 'd be asking for issues later .
when spraying gw or vallejo acrylic i will use simple green for a quick fill the pot and blast '' clean be sure to rinse .
can not remember how sg works with tamiya though i think that combo might gum up .
get into the habit of being able and ready to quickly disassemble clean and reassemble your airbrush .
you would n't paint with dirty water and a crusted paint brush wo n't give you a good point .
in a similar way 99 of your airbrush problems are cleaning problems .

majora 's mask seems like a nightmare though ... groundhog day but you get killed by skull kid/the moon 999999/1000000 .
do you also have the same opinion on referendums in ireland when they allowed gay marriage ?
the fact that a minority 's rights were at the mercy of the majority who could n't fully understand the struggles of that minority was awful .
i understand the way irish constitution is handled meant it was a necessity but that does n't change the fact that its awful that the question of should gay people have the same rights as straight people '' even had to be asked .
not a real sin but when i look at my box now i kinda regret dming vero and sig .
sure they helped me big time especially since there was n't many other opportunities at the time but boy if i could take them back now

that way you still have some left over for unexpected costs .
look for 2001 and newer what with crumple zones airbags and euro4 emissions .
do n't be picky on colors and options but be very picky on regular maintenance !
overall looks also tell you something about how it was maintained scratches inside and out for example or different brands of cheap tyres etc ... .
to give you a general idea of the costs involved i 'm posting expenses on my reliable piece of shit '' also with 20000 km/year
i 'm driving for two years and it has cost me ‚Ç¨268 up til now .
that allows me to save more or spend more money on things i actually care about .

hand sanatizer does n't cause mine but stress and hormones do..
what did help was to cover the tip of my fingers at night so i do n't scratch the crap out of my hands in my sleep .
mine started at around 19 and flared up dramatically when i was 22 i have gotten it under control with stress management..
the smaller squads thing could be done pretty easily with a coordinated team just make squads and lock the when they get to six players .
unless you have access to dvds or legit digital copies from places like itunes not pirated stuff i think its worth it .

taking destiny 1 and 2 as a good example .
these games sucked out of the box then became good later on with dlc so holding off and buying them later was the right choice .

from the dota 2 wiki puck was introduced in version 6.48 as a result of a hero creation contest held on the dota-allstars forum in which players designed a new hero to suit the faerie dragon model from warcraft iii .

i see on wikipedia that corporal punishment of children is legal in australia provided that it is reasonable '' .
i 'm not sure what the standards of reasonableness are .
either way probably the main things you could do is call the police and the department for child protection .
you might also want to contact any child abuse support organization that might exist i do n't know what those would be in australia .
even if they do n't think the headlock is physical abuse they might think depriving you of mental health care is another kind of abuse and help you .

curiosity will get the beast into your evo ... just as it would a catchal '' but your way adds a step in that the beast must interact with the t-rex .
had you been using a catchall type product it would be game over as soon as it steps in the curiosity .
catchall '' is a generic term ... ummm ... kinda like calling all facial tissues a klenex for multiple catch mouse traps i do n't think the actual model known as catchall has been made for a couple of decades..

this can make for a slight disadvantage in very specific situations .

the fight scene where cutter took down all those cops who had her at gunpoint was amazing !
too bad we did n't get to see any of it .
after season 1 i did n't expect this show to get worse writing than flash or supergirl though i guess the over the top government villain guy spouting 'maga ' should have been a clue .
okay he used his powers for a few seconds to stop one guy from being beaten up and to fly around completely unnecessarily but that just makes it worse .
the ban tip is the only thing i approve about this video .
not many yi players build black cleaver but if they knw wht bc can do for them they will build it .
i mean i know what black cleaver does and still think it sucks for yi the only good thing about it is the phage speed that i love but master yi dmg output right now is like 70 true dmg it 's way better to buy a different item if you go lethal tempo you can consider black cleaver i do n't because i do n't play that rune anyway xd .
meditate jax e is always the worse choice very easy way to let him stack his passive .
yi ca n't rely on teammates lulu support will always rather shield the 0-5 adc instead of 20-0 yi .
jax has cc and can choice his fights all the game if he ca n't win he will run away and get his team to help him he can disengage and reengage whenever he please .
yi press r and that 's his only chance .
in brief if jax can kill you he will do it .
if he ca n't he just needs to run away.. yi does n't have such a luxury that is why the matchup is so annoying

fortunately for her vs. ny ! fjorm her dagger is an exceptional tool and she has just enough res to use it reasonably well .
unfortunately her dagger is inheritable and there are potentially much better candidates out there to utilize it especially since it would combo fantastically with null c-disrupt which is infantry-exclusive .
also unfortunate is that in the comparison to ny ! fjorm fjorm has brave and firesweep bows to use for pure offensive builds as someone else mentioned already .
i doubt she will be in any way meta-altering even her weapon on other units .
but she will still be solid herself and with the right tools in the right hands her weapon can be a very strong anti-meta '' pick .

jesus christ do you even listen to yourself when you talk ?
you come off as a nutjob equating a redhat supporting a bumbling president with a symbol that equates to millions and millions of deaths and suffering .
the problem comes when you search for dupe posts find none and then get marked as a dupe of a tangentially related question that does n't solve the problem .
while i would like to believe in the ability to contest dupes in practice it seems like for especially weird or corner-casey problems proving that there is an issue becomes much harder because the person making the post typically does n't have enough information to properly recreate the problem and if they did have enough information they 'd be able to solve the problem on their own .
expecting them to be able to solve their own problem that they ca n't find an answer to in order to get an answer to their problem is absurd .
additionally do n't you need a certain amount of rep to comment ?
if you do that really curtails the discussion process when someone new with a weird problem is muted by default .

the extra content compared to the ps2 version are really nice but
dropping weapons are now much more relevant for the hangar weapons in situations
the much smaller fcs frame on a tiny screen and
the increased difficulty for some bosses is n't helpful at all .
since your save only fully convert on ac3 sl not to lr i suggest playing ac3 and sl on psp no problem .
then you could try lr on ps2 emulators and psp to try which feels right to you .
or alternatively since the story is cut through a lot due to ac nexus not playable on the psp and you 'll have a lot of catching up to do on wiki anyway you could do nexus on ps2 emulators after the first two then decide whether you wan na play lr on psp psp emulators or ps2 emulators .
disclosure lr insults you for playing and call yourself an ac player .

they tried posting their stupid video shitposts on r/swg not long ago .
most of those pvp videos just showcase how utterly cringe worthy pre-cu pvp is in general .
glowstick raves people flopping on their backs and everything else generally wrong with pre-cu 's combat .
the shitty musical choices are just icing on that proverbial cake .
they do no favors to the community by posting them and they certainly do n't serve as any attractive reason to play on basilisk .
at least to me but then i am not under any illusion that pre-cu is actually good with it 's enormous fundamental flaws and general design catastrophes .
i mean it 's fine if you want to play jedi swordsman or maybe a rifleman .
but anything else is generally useless in pvp thanks to said flaws .
i 'm just the guy who made a server that actually deals with all of those issues .
because people are allowed to wear what they want to ?
it 's kind of telling your type wants to draw conclusions on how people dress not to mention question their right to do so .

i 'll assume you want an honest answer so here are the 2 reasons
1 if you do n't make it through this round you get nothing at all so from a self serving point of view you take this to help you get through .
this seems to be the case in this episode .
2 every additional team member that gets through is both an additional question the chaser has to answer and some token amount of knowledge that the other team members might not have .
so it 's more important to get a team member through than it is to pad the pot .
taking a look at the maggot '' episode that was linked above there were 4 possibilities .
1 he got through on 3000 and they each get 7000
2 he got through on 3000 and they each got 8500
3 he failed to get through and they lost with everyone getting 0
4 he failed to get through and they won with him getting 0 and the rest getting 10,333 each
if he had to tried for 2 he would have failed .
if he had not made it through the most likely result is that the team would also have failed and 3 would have occurred .
so logically if you 're terrible at questions 1 is the best answer .
but if you 're terrible at trivia do n't go to a quiz show !
no ... you can talk to us as the mods serve as the link between the players and the devs .

everytime ive gone to the field even with an aid station we 've never had hormones on hand nor do i believe we had the capability to request them .

i 'm buying a lot of what this article is selling .
i 'd imagine not receiving those british funds may negatively effect the euro zone budgets .
that would be good for britain as they would have less exposure governmentally ?
i 'm sure a recession in the euro zone would have negative impacts on all of those british businesses that do business with the euro zone though ... would love some more educated responses here ...
actually according to elaine aron 's a highly sensitive person '' we do often feel very scared and uncomfortable with presentations .

it 's an old link i had saved you want me to look up the links for you ?
you keep defending it but not offering any explanation for any of the quotes .
all you 're saying is it 's out of context .
explain to us what it means and why is this book being cited by laws that are openly discriminatory against women is hardcore islamic countries ?
even here in our country you can find a lot of muslims that site these same verses as justification for what they do to women .
i have friends whose husbands beat them and their children and they say it 's because that 's the law as prescribed in the quran .
so please educate my ignorant ass as to the full context of the misogyny that can be found in the quran .
please explain why millions of women in the world suffer because of it .
apologists like you always say the same thing but never offer anything logical about any of this .
if you even bothered to look at the link it contains the whole book you just have to click a few buttons .
and again explain it to me in what context does striking your wife wives make it ok ?
even the taking of many wives part says a lot .
prove to me i 'm wrong instead of bloviating and saying i 'm wrong .
anything 's possible you could be an new soul .
though i 'm personally of the belief that we 've all been around the block at least a few times .
i may guess that this may be the first or one of the first incarnations that you 've had with your planet in a certain sign so that energy is new there in that way .
is it just that stuff that makes you feel like a new soul or other things in your chart ?

i do n't have lean but i do have pcos and was able to successfully rebound from my anxiety and depression .
one of the biggest helps for me was upping my intake of vegetables and also increasing magnesium through supplements .
i 'm attempting to show that suffering is on the merciful end of the justice spectrum .
in other words it 's the default and therefore deserved .
but mercy is n't about giving people what they deserve and it certainly is n't about leaving them with the default .
and even if we say that suffering is on the milder half of the justice spectrum which still does n't make sense to me it still seems that god could have moved the needle significantly further in that direction .
if i deserve '' a million lashes for having committed some crime and you reduce my sentence to 800,000 when you could simply have shown me the error of my ways and helped me rehabilitate that seems very far from mercy .
it may sound flippant to say god has a plan and while i agree that this has no explanatory power the point is that you have no place to say that god is not permitted to allow suffering because if the possibility exists that suffering is part of some greater plan then it is permitted .
it does n't sound flippant at all but it does sort of illustrate the difficulty of mounting a rational defense of an unknowable plan .
essentially it still boils down to even though seemingly needless suffering does n't align with our human notions of fairness you just have to trust god because we know god to be good .
and that means trusting that he 's doing what 's best at all times . ''
that 's not really a rational defense so much as an appeal to faith .
and i can understand why a devout christian would find that compelling starting from their worldview and position of faith but i ca n't help feeling that we 've circled back to the original argument put forward by the reverend .
that sort of suggests that we have n't landed on a better defense of suffering than the one he 's advancing .
because they ceased to exist when it actually mattered most

a number of the cyberpower rack mount units actually come with feet so that you can stand them up if a rack is n't available .
a 2u rackmount unit that also has the feet so it can stand upright if you need it too .
if budget is n't a concern i 'd certainly look at the rack mount units and see if what you 're interested in has an option for feet as well .
that way if/when you get a rack you wo n't be looking for a new ups just to be able to mount it in the rack..

there are many small breed dogs that are perfect but here 's the ones i reccomend
they are non-shedding very socialable outgoing and friendliest dogs for children .
they have much stronger bones than most smaller breeds so smaller children can pick up and drop the dog without him getting hurt .
they do however need more attention to grooming due to their curly contuine growing double coat .
they are very easy to train and love playing !
i had one growing up and they are by far my favorite breed to have !
like the yorkshire terrier aussie terries have that beautiful blue fur coat the only difference is they have a more silkier coat than the yorkshire .
they do love both playing and snuggling up on the couch .
second choice of breed i have 2 currently and they are truly wonderful babies .
they stay near me all the time and love nothing more than to cuddle and play .
they were easily trained right at 9 months of age and never had problems with kids !
a non-shedding breed shih tzu 's are amount favorites for older couples due to their loyalty and snuggly perosnallity .
some shih tzu prefer playing over snuggling or snuggling over playtime .
they are sometimes prone to certain health conditions due to their snout and can be sometimes a bit more challenging to train .
third choice fianc√© dog is a shih tzu and i love her to bits .
the only problem i find with her is that she lost a lot of teeth when she was a puppy and can be a bit stubborn with me but otherwise a great dog
mini poodles pomeranians maltese lhasa opsa havanese and corgi .

i 've worked at several institutions and the campus police always puts the students first .
generally to save the institution from any lawsuits lol op go to both campus police and real police .
if you go to the real police i know they will involve campus police and housing .
whatever i just find this funny and sad at the same time .
turns out that telecom companies are actually in the process of implementing a caller-id verification system i guess that they realized that they were on the wrong side .
are there any weightlifters in japan tokyo area that would like to train together with me ?
that was just a drop in but i bogeyed the next hole which is one i normally birdie would have given me a personal best .
until he sees all the negative press tomorrow then we 'll be back on again .
until nancy informs him that if he shows up it will be just him and the camera crew in an empty chamber .
no one has yet had the tenacity and disguise/camouflage skills to make it happen but i 'm an optimist .
i figure all good things come to those who wait .
it wo n't give me an option to ship to you .
i 'm a big stipe fan but it 's funny to compare how he handled losing to dc with cyborg .
she asked for the rematch and when it looked like it would n't happen she 's already talking about kayla harrison .
stipe has done nothing but beg dc for a rematch .
i hope he gets it but it 'd been nice to see him have a fall back fight to hype up .
okay so again i apologize for jumping to conclusions a bit more than i should have .
either way especially with a lot of things going on these days with rape accusations i 'd like to say that we as americans have started taking seemingly passive comments more seriously .
age of consent here is typically 18 sometimes lower in other states but as far as sex goes anyone under 18 should be a baby to anyone over 18 .
that 's all sorry for coming off so strong this type of stuff just really pisses me off .
too many teenagers and childhoods ruined over this kind of behavior .
knife so i actually have a really nice 22 morakniv but i just replaced it with this tactical knife that 's used by usa special forces .
phones i know carrying two phones would appear weird at first glance but i can get free calls on my mom 's plan on the phone on the left and then for only 5 a month i get unlimited text messaging from the phone on the right .
it even opens up and has a complete keyboard so i do n't have to hit a number three times to scroll through letters .
pepper mace not pepper spray this is pepper mace .
tactical paracord bracelet/flashlight i can have light pointing directly off of my hand while i 'm working on something and in case of emergency the paracord is literally the best survival tool in the world .
i could tear it apart and use it to build a shelter or even break it down to the threads and use it as line to fish for food .
i do n't smoke or do drugs or anything but i figure maybe some day someone will ask me for a light and i 'll have one and then we could be friends or something i do n't know .
pretty much the best thing that 's ever happened to me .
i know now i 'll never hit a hole in one or win the lottery but i did this in 1995 and i tell most everyone i meet .

if you want shooting stars get outside city limits at night and enjoy the show .
yeah but they want the shooting stars to be visible in the city and at a certain time at a certain number .
i finished the sbc on sunday so i have barely used him but he 's been good so far .
but at the same time something like that would make people even more afraid to speak out about it and that 's already an insanely large problem .
like evidence of them saying or admitting to the lie .
people are already afraid of social reactions repercussions and testifying .
add the possibility of someone falsely accusing you of lying and going to prison for reporting a crime would make it even worse .
i was hoping for more literal heavy metal robert e howard conan horror fantasy world connection in that movie .

one thought he worked incredibly hard going from i think it was executive analyst 1 step below vp got the job as a green undergrad with no experience in finance to president in four years when his dad stepped down

you only know barely enough to run one department after that time at best .
how did the business do once the son took over ?
sure i just do n't like dogma and cognitive dissonance .
it 's good that people are engaged with news politics and social issues it 's not helpful when people see a wedge issue and immediately respond with confirmation bias .
if my comment has any effect on anyone i hope it plants a seed of self-reflection and makes them take a more nuanced view on complicated issues instead of sticking with dogma .

it ruins the game for people who want to play football and who want everyone to be challenged by the game of football and not have a football version of a home run derby .
it might be fun for superficial people but there are actually people in the world who like to get deeper into the matter as it is much more rewarding that scratching the surface .
however fifa is not a game but a money making slot machine/pin-ball-machine like program with a frame of football .
a very good frame of football but the gameplay is similar to that of nintento world cup on nes from the 90s .
that might be an aspiration for a mobile game to dick around a bit but not for a game that has so much potential simply if only the sliders were changed .

children have no concept of death horrific injury/pain or the consequences of injuries .
that is why kids need to be given a healthy dose of fear to make it sink in that they need to be cautious in certain situations .
that is why you spank a kid for running into traffic .

exactly once you open the door to reparations for armenians the kurds arabs greeks bosnians etc can all in theory claim damage from the ottomans and line up .
turkey simply ca n't open itself to that world .
all of her foreign relations can become clouded by these tools against her interests .
it 's very simple ... people love saying this genocide denial thing but would a country of 85 million open herself to harm over something it technically did n't do and which was over 100 years ago and which only jeopardizes the relations with a minor neighbor ?
no country would ... france and england have n't apologized for their recent colonial crimes for the same reason .
the us has n't paid reparations to the natives or slaves for similar reasons .
reddit always oversimplifies this issue into turkey is evil but it 's a very difficult diplomatic tightrope .
one all major nations must walk ... if armenia renounced all claims against turkey in exchange for recognizing the genocide then maybe it would happen .
but otherwise armenia will use the recognition to claim eastern turkey ...
yeah i recently played the vn then watched the anime straight away afterwards .
still a great anime but that first episode feels incredibly rushed compared to the beginning of the vn .
1 they could achieve that by setting up or building out a singapore subsidiary .
moving head office is much more of a strategic and in the mid-tern tax decision .
2 nothing that you said excuses the rank hypocrisy of banging on about britain and british businesses and how they 'll benefit from brexit and then moving your business out of britain as brexit happens .
even if brexit is not a factor in the decision and i 'm fairly confident it is then it still shows arrogance and a one rule for me '' attitude .
to support brexit which makes it far harder for the typical brit to move around or benefit from the skills of other countries while taking that to an extreme in his own acts is wrong .
3 the fact that he recently decided to manufacture the cars there and less recently decided to manufacture everything else there does n't justify this .
it anything it shows it 's a pattern of behaviour and that the pivot away from the uk will continue .

even more so on gigantomachia and the mysterious ujiko .
but introducing new enemies to midoriya is n't the solution here .
we 've already seen alot pop up in between the mention of the final boss to where we are now .
with the exception of the pro hero arc the next move we should see after the joint training arc should be focused and coming from the villains side because they 've been dead silent for more than one reality year now .

id like the game store to be unified with the xbox app .
also being able to choose an install location for all games .
some require install on c drive and just install there right away .
one thing that is annoying on xbox and i dont remember if its this way on pc is when you buy a game and it just starts installing right away .
hard drive space is limited and games go on sale .

the last time i tried to redeem the points i had to call in instead of being able to do so on the website or app did i miss an update to how they can be redeemed ?
there 's lots of different reasons why people may be against suicide .
some people may just not know how to approach someone who 's suicidal in the fear that they might do or say the wrong thing to the person .
others might not be able to empathise how exactly the suicidal person is feeling or how to help them .
other people may also have had a previous experience with someone who was suicidal and it did n't go well .
a example could be if someone in their family committed suicide and caused a lot of harm due to their death and that may have left a bad opinion about the topic to those who were affected .
similarly a key reason why many people are against suicide is because it 's often a permanent fix to a often temporary or treatable problem and one 's death can negatively affect the people around them sometimes even provoking others to kill themselves .
a few months ago a now semi-notorious tv show was released on netflix and one of the main characters in this fictional high school setting tv show killed themselves but remained as a ghost/vision to the other high school characters after the person 's suicide and because of that ideation of suicide in the show there was a spike in suicides in real life so while suicide may not seem to harm people it certainly can to due cause and effect .
if r/morbidquestions allowed people to make posts asking for advice on how to kill one 's self and it was given answers the op of the post would more likely go through with their attempt and be less likely to seek out help .
if the op did manage to kill themselves because of the advise they received those who give the advise would likely be held responsible for the person 's death .
other people who may also be suicidal could end up going on the same post reading the same advise mentioned and manage to kill themselves also .

no wonder my parents were so pissed at me all the time .
we are good now but i totally get why they were mad about it .
at the time i was like fuck the man ! ! .
now i just feel bad for putting them through so much stress .
now that i 'm older and have my shit together we do love to laugh about all the dumb shit i used to do .

amazing quality for the price but y'all knew that already .
let 's see how oc does on the main sub .
it seems kind of stupid but i gave this one guy silver and they sent really nice msgs so i gave them gold and plat .
they said i made their day but honestly their messages really lifted my spirits up .
i do n't plan on upgrading for at least 4 years .
then again i doubt i could find a better phone .
also the consent forms and edu videos we had to do were extremely informative .
while i do agree riven is in a strong state right now its too early to say how strong she actually is .

we may be approaching the end of they '' being the president not just due to the shutdown or the lack of casus belli but that trump is already the first chief executive to be directly checked over the war powers act .
i 'm doubtful he 'd win a legislative or judicial showdown over it and congress is unlikely to authorize anything given the syrian pullout or the afghanistan scaledown .
this is prime example of why you really should n't speed
people in this thread are already getting mad over it even though it 's an unscored review that they did n't read .
as a not great pvp player but enjoys it who struggles to get to fabled though very close now i wonder how much i will be fomo'ing .
assuming i get to fabled the grenade launcher steps feel like a pain and not fun .
i do n't want to play like 50-75 games of quickplay to just camp heavy with pog i just want to play and have fun .
just goto statements that are named with strings that are just diatribes about potted plants .
you say you want an implementation of static bases as vehicles .
or somewhere else i can look to get an outline of what 's wanted ?
i did a quick search of the issues but could n't find anything .
failing that is irc the best place to come and talk to you guys about what you 'd like ?
i 'm not planning on going at this right away .
i 'd like to start with something simpler to get the hang of the codebase and style etc .
i 'll probably look at 27364 and 26475 smoking racks working outside of the reality bubble tonight to get myself started but as a bigger project static bases sounds like it could be fun to do .
i wonder how many people who call it failcast '' have actually bought a resin model from gw in the last 2 years .
they 've completely reformulated the resin they use to get it much closer to fw while still being usable in old metal molds and actually learned a lot of lessons about making molds for resin so things designed to be resin from the ground up tend to come out just fine .
about the only thing that makes gw resin still a pain in the ass is how many sprue connection points they have but that 's to make sure they are n't full of air bubbles so it 's either sand down divots or fill in bubbles .
this is not a good thing in my book .
because you oppressed and the jews/george soros is out to get you

rumble matches are the main selling point my dude .
ok to be honest b and c. me personally i would get so turned on i would join in .
not only that but guys want to feel desireable also and what better way to do that then know you are that turned on by his voice .
i used to be a radio dj and was always told how sexy my voice was and yes i had listeners call in and tell me not only was my voice sexy but they masturbated to me .
i even had one listener who would call and wait for me to do the weather and when i came back to the phone she would be cumming .
it was a huge ego boost and made me feel great about myself .
perhaps a discussion first would be more appropriate too .
the best way i 've heard it described is to try and remember the time before you were born .
there was nothing there is no consciousness it 's just solitary nothing forever .
and it 's fine because when it happens i wo n't feel strongly about it either way because i wo n't have a consciousness .

oh and all the ethics rules we are n't to violate .
socialism is a pro-society in cooperation and human-centered ideology .
it does n't necessarily follow that the government is involved with command economy .
employee and consumer owned cooperatives are a great example .
please refer to my prior comment related to the aggressive propaganda that tries to shut down even simple conversation about this important set of issues .
government job programs national healthcare systems and environmental protections are all prosocial policies because of the objectives those were determined to accomplish .
suffice to say and imo select parts of the un do not represent the best interests of america nor the people all over the world .
a brief review of its history since its founding only point to the fact that it has failed in its mission .
this organization like too many others have been fully infiltrated .
please refer to the us congress for just one prime
america would do very well to once and for all kick out organizations like the cfr and others .

nope you were wrong about a minor technicality so everything you said was wrong .
literally the very first thing he did upon taking office was enacting the muslim travel ban '' which was quickly shot down in court .

got off with a warning because a it was a dead ass section of road i was the only car moving and b i still had the 30 day tags on my brand new car .
officer asked if i knew how fast i was going and i told him i legitimately do n't sir .
i literally just got this car i 'm too used to my old volvo that would shake and shimmy above 55 letting me know when i got too fast . ''
officer said well i see the tags so i know you 're telling the truth .
i 'm gon na cut you a break this time .

very few of the reported list include politicians in the 2nd half of the 20th century and century-to-date in the 21st ... castro being the exception .
most of those in the last 70ish years are because of involvement in splinter organizations or movements .
of course this is is not a complete list .
private companies have a mandate from shareholders to maximize profits so they deny defer and drag their feet until the problem goes away the patient gives up or dies .
they do n't give a god damn about keeping clients happy because most clients are told which insurance they 're getting from their group policy at work .
just build rod into spellbinders now if you like the early game damage .
yeah it sucks to have to hold onto enough gold to get the rod in the early game but for like 350 less gold you get more damage than oblivion orb gave you .
also spellbinders is definitely more powerful of a completed item than morellos .
it does suck not getting the extra hp and grievious wounds if you need it though .
but 10 movespeed is also very much overlooked and can be amazing on ryze
if you saw a someone you would n't really have a choice but to accept that they exist .
so in other words everyone automatically gets into heaven no matter what ?
everyone who accepts the existence of god gets into heaven everyone sees god when they die and everyone who sees god accepts he exists so logically everyone must get into heaven .
do you still feel like the most happy man in the world ? ''

mandroid echostar went on tour with megadeth and are really good .

when i left i fell back on christianity immediately .
and then decided that i should do my due diligence researching the doctrine like i had done with mormonism .
and unfortunately i found a lot of the same problems .
unreliable contradictory scriptures written hundreds of years after jesus lived and some clearly fabricated .
i learned about how fucked up the crusades were and the other sick things that were done in the name of christianity .
the problem is once you see one house of cards fall you realize that none of them stand on their own .
impact and mlw do n't seem to mind sharing talent and court bauer did seem to indicate he would be forging more official alliances in the near future .
i do n't see him signing on with roh/cmll/njpw after what just happened with rush so impact/aaa might be the most likely group for them to join .
i 'd say a mix of that the housing crisis and geographical remoteness would play a part ...
also amsterdam is probably more attractive to most people than dublin .

i assume simple was a typo but i am curious as to what the intended word is !
cod as a series has always been focused on the casual player base and giving them a chance to do well without putting in the time so they keep playing .
if it is predictable then good players will manipulate it to their advantage think about all the spawn camping on the older titles a casual player does n't want to play a game where that happens so cod introduced revenge spawns spawning the guy who got killed close enough to his killer that he can run up and kill him from behind revenge spawns have been around since mw2 and exist in this game but they are n't enough since good players abuse them i do it all the time kill someone move two feet and wait two seconds and guy will come back thinking you are in the old spot so you kill him again rinse and repeat so they must have added a randomness to spawns that was really apparent in cod wwii so that good players ca n't predict when they will flip and sometimes when they flip they will flip for one or two spawners and flip back .
it is an intentional design so that good players ca n't abuse the spawn system to build kill streaks .
i think most people will fly it on alpenwolf 's cold war server where viggens are in my opinion and experience the best fighter in town .

i dont have any suggestions but lake havasu is so fucking beautiful and im so happy you are there !
well the north will be ruled by one of jon sansa bran or arya ... .depending who survives .
and obviously if jon survives and becomes king or something or if jon dies then sansa would take over etc .
bran said he ca n't be lord of winterfell anymore i mean he can but this imo means sansa would take winterfell over bran and definitely over arya .
if he survives he 1000 will be legitimized and rule storm 's end .
otherwise the only person currently shown that could is maybe davos since he 's been hand to two kings .
the riverlands will belong to edmure if he is still alive or one of catelyn 's children sansa bran or arya .
honestly it makes the most sense for sansa to take over the riverlands riverrun .
the westerlands is jamie tyrion and cersei depending on who survives .
personally i do n't see any chance cersei survives .
and tyrion is clearly the best leader in the show .
but its probably not even likely that jamie survives either .
if tyrion survives he 's gunna run some shit just do n't know where .
the tyrells are all gone as well as the other tarlys .
sam is the highest person alive in the reach once you get passed the nw vows .
the vale is robyn 's until he 's killed or something .
they probably wo n't even show anything with him .
you can just assume he 's nothing more than a pawn that sides with the north/riverlands for all things .
because the showrunners clearly do n't give a single fuck about dorne .
iron islands will depend on who survives out of yara euron and theon .
if none do they 'll have a kings moot .
out of all these people who would vote against tyrion ?
maybe edmure and euron if he survives thats it .
i mean obviously dany and jon are both more likely to be king/queen but if both die ?
especially after you consider cersei is the queen right now and he heirs are jamie and tyrion .
even that 's not so black and white because the foreskin contains the majority of the nerve endings in the penis whereas the clitoris actually continues much further under the skin than the part which is seen and which is removed in clitoridectomy which is essentially the tip .
fgm does n't always remove the ability to orgasm and circumcision can make a man unable to orgasm in some cases .
they 're really not that easy to compare in terms of severity since everyone 's genitals are different .
in that case i believe you would use tell .
petey from the top of the circle book it .
did you use it before you went to bed ?
actually the tweet is incorrect as he had 155 buckets altogether in the last 5 games field goals fts .
the title is misleading as well because fts are always unassisted and more than half of the buckets were fts in that stretch 79 to be precise .
now you know how your parents felt when you were born.

this is a great list but it does n't exactly describe the means of managing those conditions or whether post-viability inducing labor or performing a c-section would be an option .
i imagine that 's what op 's nurse is claiming that no matter what a doctor could always as a last resort just cut into a woman and remove the baby .
it 's in between seasons right now but my hero academia is an amazing show to get into .
i and most others that have seen the show would say it 's a cut above most other shonen .
no giant robot fights but a great show nonetheless .
it starts out a bit slow but i think you 'll either be hooked by the end of season 1 or the midpoint of season 2 .
i 've been making great progress throughout the years and do see the effects it has on myself and others .
abstaining is not the most popular opinion but i encourage it no doubt !
also i think it was a hit from hunwick that injured marc savard and caused him to retire ... basically chiarelli lost savard and hunwick for cohen .
but when i dream about getting fucked by an alien im coming to you about it
according to my past experience this isnt a good new tbh xd .
i was a cleaner for a chalet/caravan park and i went to clean a chalet following a check-out .
the guests had covered all of the faucets the toilet and the shower head with tin foil .
i was mopping the bathroom floor but the water was just pooling around the drain .
i tried to plunge it but it would n't go down .
i pulled back the drain cover and the drain had been stuffed with tin foil .
i think i still have photos on an old phone somewhere .
if i can find them i 'll link them in

buried inside the wall of comments lies this little nugget of truth .
venezuela is going through a coup that was instigated by the us to counter competing interests .
the problem with game theory is this treating countries like chess pieces in a game means eventually there will be a loser .
that means the victor in the end will have to look at themselves and will most likely boil from the inside .
dont mind if he 's a little pricey cos luckily i got the coins and i 'm building a new bundesliga team which could be promising especially since i did joelinton yesterday too
my professor specifically mentioned the ostfront as being too large of a topic to cover .

i do n't disagree which is why i 've been trying to find some objective history on the topic .
this is the podcast i 've been listening to .
i originally got into it because i visited venezuela on business maybe 15 years ago and really really like simon boulivar down there .
it seemed like a natural thing to study since i knew nothing about it .
a few dozen podcasts later and we 're working our way through south america haiti and now mexico .
also most people from the us do n't know anything about anywhere .
i mean it happens to me when my underwear like rolls up on itself and in becomes kinda like a thong .

i think you 're forgetting that she 's a youtuber now so her target audience is about 15 and high school girls who spend their time watching vloggers love that stuff !
i 've actually been watching her series and i like it she talks a little about her experience being on her own and navigating being famous when she was still a teenager and i think it 's sweet .
honestly she 's always seemed to me like she was protected from a lot of the things wrong with gymnastics because she was so normal so her perspective comes off a little fake these days .
people who do n't like her are of course valid but i personally enjoy her content not for the gymnastics but just because i like her .

i 'm kind of fascinated with this alt right youtuber boxing/mma match drama between a moderate alt righter and a crazy insane alt righter
in my applications i use the europass cv as a quick summary of what i 've done whereas the motivational/personal letter is the one where i highlight the parts that i think are relevant to the company .
has landed me quite a few interviews and positions .
i sometimes do some small adjustments in the cv for different companies if i think some parts might be negative/neutral e.g .
highlight some details of my cannabinoid research for lab-positions whereas i 'll just quickly mention i 've done research for pharmacy-positions .
the most annoying thing ever for me was having to first send in a cv then fill in their online form exactly the same then send in a personal letter then have some sort of skill-test and after that fill in some personalized questions that had basically the same content as my personal letter .
so much work for that position though i know it was a popular one with good pay good advancement options and a 4 year guaranteed place .

slippery slope is hier niet echt toe te passen denk ik als dat √ºberhaupt ooit kan andere discussie .
maar vanuit dezelfde hoek vind ik dit toch een slecht idee sommige ministers schat ik echt niet in staat om zelf op eigen houtje wetten aan te passen of in te trekken '' en niet omdat ik denk dat ze kwaad in de zin hebben maar omdat onze ministers niet altijd verstand hebben van waar ze mee bezig zijn .
het aantal wetten dat sneuvelt is best hoog dus ministers dit zonder controle laten doen lijkt me een recept voor chaos .
en hoe ga je afvangen dat twee ministers elkaar in de weg kunnen zitten met hun zelfbedachte ideetjes ?
lijkt me eigenlijk best wel interessant om te horen wat iedereen in de kamer hiervan vind .

that 's what gets me about this whole thing is how far it actually got .
so lem me get this straight ... a pakistani man who was 20 years older meets this young woman on a class trip overseas while she was still in high school and chats her up .
they keep in touch all the way up to the point where she decides to drop out of stanford .
and which is when she starts a company where she has a rudimentary grasp at best as a sophomore dropout on how this particular field worked .
meanwhile this man was purported to be a former tech entrepreneur in the 90 's somehow cashed out right before the tech bubble burst and made a fortune .
you mean to tell me there are pictures all over the internet with tech moguls and big names in silicon valley of how they were just starting out dating back from the 60s/70s/80s/90s ... but somehow if you google this guy ramesh sunny balwani there are no images of this dude from 7 years ago let alone the 90s ?
the whole thing is straight out of a trutv doc or msnbc fraud special .

the chances of the next 4 matching that one however is 1/20 4 or 0.000625

in jojo part 6 one character has a regular ass gun and another character has the ability to split objects into two copies and instantly recombine them at her leisure which makes them physically zoom into each other at high speed .
so at one point when the heroes are in deep shit character a pulls out gun character b splits a bullet into two copies they fire one of the bullets into the distance character b holds the copy of the bullet in her hand tight hugs everyone and recombines the bullets .
since she 's holding onto one copy of the bullet the entire group zooms miles away instantly .
hmm maybe our boy asmodai 's gon na say that he 's pretending to be sara 's lover and in that way she can drink his essence in a natural way perhap ?

i looked hard at windows devices when i looked for a new laptop but decided on the pixelbook .
i do n't need anything windows offered more than what was available i love using the same apps as on my phone making synchronization and sharing easy .
chromeos is reliable you dont waste time with configuration updates and other nonsense unlike windows .
the pixelbook is extremely well made and compact for anyone who needs an ultra portable device .
the screen is beautiful and lends itself to productivity due to the format .
i love the 2 in 1 functionality of the pixelbook .
i bought a 20 dollar lenovo stylus for it and it works very well .
i travel a lot live abroad mobility and fucntionality is key to me .
makes the workflow so much easier between pixelbook and phone and documents i need to share with my wife .
i did n't see what windows could bring to the table .
similar devices to the pixelbook are actually more expensive on windows .
i dont want to pay annual fees to use office .
i dont have a windows phone or windows apps on my phone .
have it for more than a year now and it works like a charm .
question for james you mentioned an interest in japanese jazz '' and i was curious as to what you listen to ?
jazz is my favourite kind of music i listen to a lot of the big band stuff from people like frank sinatra bobby darin and louis prima and i 'd like to find as much to listen to as possible since jazz is n't exactly very popular .
i find a lot of nintendo games have great jazz pieces mario 3d world mario kart 8 smash bros donkey kong country etc .
and would love to hear more stuff like that .
this argument makes no sense a lot of things take away time from their kids .

nice fake ass screenshot u posted ur own proof against you
i 'm sort of in the same space and what i 'm saying to myself is that a nicer piece can be amortized over many years vs crap that falls apart looks hodge podged .
for instance i need a console/media center/buffet type piece 1,000 at cb2 or i can buy two pieces at targer for 250 each except every write up was how hard it is to put them together .
if i end up paying 100 for a handyman to put each piece together i 'm out 700 plus it looks weird to have two pieces of furniture side by side vs one piece that is the perfect measurement .
i do n't know if that helps but it 's how my brain is justifying this expense !
i see but they are only half of what i get but ill make do .
contract gigs are much better than in-house you get to set the hours you work .
for a 1 year gig i 'd ensure that i always work on a strict schedule and that my team knows that for example i begin working at 9 and stop at 5 .
it 's important that you maintain a defined work-life balance and your employers are informed .
you might also need to start looking into tax and insurance if that 's something you 're not familiar with .
this is a longer contract so it 's best to discuss with an accountant now to avoid unexpected tax surprises later .

glimpsing at your comment history your preferred tactic seems to be talking down to people and behaving as if you exist on some higher plane of reality .

one of my sub boys was asked to be a sperm donor for a lesbian couple in berkeley .
he was 19 at the time the couple in their early 30 's .
they wanted to do everything at home and avoid doctors and hospitals at this point .
on a preplanned schedule he would go over to their house have dinner and then go into a back room and jack off into a turkey baster .
the baster was then inserted into the recipient by her partner .
this was repeated several times until it was successful .
they were interested in my boy because he was at the time a college honors student who had been jumped two grades to get out of high school two years early .
the agreement made was that he would have no say in the rearing of the child but was welcome to visit .
exactly they do n't like doin that they be one sided as shit on here

purity doesnt matter not once did i say anything about purity because its my culture and ancesty that i am proud of
the guidelines you mention shoot for a roughly 18.1:1 water to coffee ratio for brewed coffee .
that is more water than i brew with i usually do 14:1 or 15:1 so 1 l of coffee would be more like 67 70 grams of coffee .
i do n't use an auto drip machine and do almost only pourovers these days .
my normal brews are either 300 ml of water to 20 g coffee or 390 ml of water to 25.5 g coffee 15.3:1 and i will do that maybe 3-4 times a day so probably 80-100 grams of coffee a day 40-50 fl oz a day .
if i make espresso i normally make a double shot using 18-20 g of coffee .
replace one of my pourovers with one of those double shots if so .
so i actually think the coffee you 're making would be a little weak for me but you say it tastes strong which could mean you 're maybe overextracting and drawing out more bitterness or you use darker roasted coffee .
you say 6 cups on your sgp churns out 30 grams .
i do n't know what a cup is in breville-speak but you can change the dosing size on the sgp .

once it 's at the buffering '' state the track can not be skipped by the headunit any longer .
it was also in the same format as shock which does an infinitely better job of removing the question of morph .

bulma is like the best female db character so far
that turns out to be a fairly unpopular idea .
according to kaiser support for medicare for all drops to 37 percent if survey takers are told that the bill would eliminate private insurance companies with 58 percent opposed .
in other words americans want access to government insurance but they do n't want to be forced to use it‚Äîpeople prefer optionality .
kaiser finds that 73 percent of adults support creating a national government administered health plan similar to medicare open to anyone but would allow people to keep the coverage they have. this is an idea that in health policy world generally gets referred to as medicare for anyone. the closest thing to it is probably a proposal produced by the center for american progress that would ban private insurers from competing on the individual market and would create strong incentives for employers to move their employees onto the federal plan .
in short single payer is unpopular while multipayer with a public option is very popular .
that 's probably how you fix a lot of those problems .

if he can duplicate this past season it would be great to lock him up sans any no trade clause .
corbin got a 6 year deal at an average of 23.3m and he 's 29 years old this year .
at some point you 've got to be weary of this freak losing his super hero powers .
at the same time how do you bet against him .
like you said maybe you get a shorter deal .
even if his numbers start to diminish some you 're still going to have an amazing figure in the clubhouse and essentially an extra pitching coach .
maybe add in some mutual options beyond a 3 year deal .
the only way i see verlander going back to detroit is on a one day retirement contract .
or in several years when if his numbers decline drastically and he ca n't give up the game on a cheap contract .
me thinks upton prefers houston if it 's an either/or situation .
with jv i think he 's only going to sign with a team who has a pristine chance of winning a world series .
so i wonder if whether he signs with the astros depends a lot on what the team looks like and/or who they sign this offseason before the trade deadline and next offseason .
stros ' free agent outlook key players for the most part ...

if you eat meat try some slices of plain deli turkey .
i notice salty foods are a bit easier for me to eat when i feel this way .
a few slices of turkey is easy to get down as i do n't have to take large bites or have a mouthful of food which sometimes makes me gag when i 'm already not feeling well .
after my stomach settles i can usually eat something more substantial .
also plain white rice with butter and salt is another one of my go toos when i 'm having one of these days .

puttonyos is the unit given to denote the level of sugar and hence the sweetness of hungarian dessert wine called tokaji or tokay .
it is traditionally measured by the number of hods of sweet botrytised or nobly rotted grapes known as asz√∫ added to a barrel of wine but is now measured in grams of residual sugar .
the puttony was actually the 25 kg basket or hod of asz√∫ grapes and the more added to the barrel of wine the sweeter the eventual wine .
firstly i did n't see fifty shades brought up in that article at all am i missing the mention of it ?
secondly why interpret male or female fantasy as explicitly referring to sex ?
these gender stereotypes go beyond that with things like men stereotypically wanting a fast really nice car or a woman stereotypically wanting children .
do you really think the items on that list correlate to events in the books in the ways that the women who 's opinions were used on that list were thinking they would correlate ?

after acct 300a intermediate i and acct 320 cost accounting the material is generally unfamiliar and a bit tougher to grasp which many people are not expecting or used to and that is why acct 300b intermediate ii is the weeder class .
you can not be lazy in any of these classes and they are much harder than 201 or 202 .
acct 300b while acct 300a covers the asset side of the balance sheet this class covers liabilities and equity .
take good notes read the book and enroll in si if you can .
i have yet to not see anyone pass that did n't put in the work .
i recommend chung her exams are tough but you will learn and thank her for it later .
consolidations are no joke but it is the same with 300b in that if you put in the time it is very doable .
some people find this class harder and some find it easier depends on the person .
acct 351 this class is generally seen as one of the not as difficult accounting courses .
i highly recommend taking grace she only teaches in spring but have also heard good things about lee .
it goes more in-depth into the material and adds new concepts .
similar in difficulty to acct 351 if you take landa do n't take it with anyone else if you have the choice .
acct 470 usually take in your last semester due to impaction .
difference is todd 's exams are 25 straight forward multiple choice questions and zhang is part multiple choice part short answer and part written case .
if you can take this class before your last semester do it .
not exam heavy but group project heavy and it is time consuming .
try to take with friends who you work well with for the project .
it is more like an information systems class with microsoft access and bpmn models than an actual accounting class .
we all know people who take shit too far and have problems

it 's so tragic that they abort their puppies .
i know we have too many homeless animals but this is very hard on a dog who is hormonally prepared to be a mother .
this is why vets wo n't neuter a dog in heat .
literally any time a dog dies or has to be put down in a movie i lose my shit .
love the teasing top hope that 's just the start ...
if it 's hormones and chemicals it 's real though right ?

no i did n't beckause my point was referring to the man with the chainsaw so fokus for a bit jhonny kage is much more than just a movie star '' and you know this very well jason does n't fit bekause in the movies from his pov he 's killing viktims that have no chance of fighting back so unless you give the player who plays as jason that vibe then you 've failed at representing the kharacter and this vibe ka n't be achieved in a fighting game unless you 're fighting someone who does n't know what he 's doing so jason does n't fit fighting games in general he belongs in dead by daylight i ca n't say shit about freddy since i did n't watch any of the movies
mkx added 8 kharacters and that sounds enough to me are you implying that not wanting half of the dlc to be random movie kharacters is immature ?
so nrs ca n't get money by making a good fighting game and supporting it ?
they need to resort to guest kharacters in order to make money ?
sorry m8 but if that 's how it works they should just quit making mk games and start making krossovers like super smash bros
amara is a living sword that served original grand celestial emperor in the past now sealed within the depth of naryu treasury .
the sword awakened along with the emperor 's relic as admiral chol mugo sacrificed valindrian lives to channel mystic energy around the ruins .
dokgom ordered by mugo to further investigate the ancient relic eventually reached where the fabled emperor 's sword is sealed within .
upon touching the sword however it encapsulated dokgom in naryu automation and took control of his body hence why amara 's idle dialogues read finally i awaken . ''
the whole fight revolves around dokgom trying to take advantage of ripple in amara 's consciousness in order to bring back the control .

what 's the difference for these companies between paying tax and having their assets seized eh ?
if a normal person tries to avoid tax like a company like amazon does they 'd have the wrath of hmrc to deal with .
if you started giving amazon the option of paying it 's fair share or getting out of the country and thanking it for it 's sacrifice either we end up with protected small businesses owned by british people in britain or we end up with more subsidy money for fighting monopolies to again fund small businesses .

lots of people sign in america to join the military for lots of reasons .
we did n't sign to get hazed and go through some awful shit in bootcamp but hey shit happens literally .
also if you read the beginning of the post i typed usmc bootcamp .
thats united states marine corps bootcamp not brat camp .
there are lots of people who want to serve and keep their country safe .
some people want to do it because their family member served .
there are people who do it for the benefits .
there are people who has no idea and just joins because they have nothing better to do and no college in their future immediately out of high school .
there are people who do it for the wrong reasons like just for the title or because they think its cool .
ultimately military is supposed to prepare you for war .
if everything is going to be pretty with butterflies flying around where every holds your hand and helps you with everything during bootcamp well let me tell you .
when shit hits the fan you wo n't be prepared .
this is a small sample size but at my office in alpen aan de rijn some people cycle approx 15 20 km one way .

do n't pick a solution if you do n't know what your requirements are .
we had to deal with this most recently with tyrod taylor .
on one hand he was arguably the best qb we had since bledsoe 13 years ago and got us in the playoffs 17 years but it was clear he was n't the long term solution.we all knew we were going to draft a qb in the draft the issue going into the offseason was are we going to keep him for another year.i myself thought he was a serviceable qb and the bridge to get us to the next guy .
our sub was split with some wanting another veteran and others wanting peterman being the guy this year while we develop who ever we drafted .
as you know we traded tyrod drafted allen signed aj mccarron traded mccarron to oakland started peterman and allen was starting by week 2 .
the point is at the end of the day you have know idea what you front office going to do.the question is what are you going to do if you move on from carr ?
or make a trade for someone like joe flacco ryan tannenhill or blake bortels ?
k but we 're talking about the transportation system as a whole .

all things considered i 'm glad he could get the experience of pens though i 'm sure we 'll have plenty of them in the coming years for him !
i like it man do n't let anyone put you and your grilled cheese down
did you have any contact info like who you are ?
you set up meetings with other people who want to get things done .
in the beginning you tell each other what you would like to get done in the 50 min and then you start working .
after 50 min you tell each other how it went .
for me it is the committing part that helps .
once again you have demonstrated an excellent knowledge of general chart reading .
however in this chart this change in plotting methods the only possible source of misinformation is completely irrelevant for the reasons i and the author went over .
they used multiple different proxies to show agreement that 's the point of having multiple different proxies .
this chart used i would assume conglomerate of proxies all in agreement .
i am beginning to doubt your chart reading ability .
and once again those are n't medians over time they 're medians over sources .
in your analogy i would be the engineer i do n't know what you do but i do n't see how it could be more relevant than collecting and plotting this data .
climate scientists are the people who collect and understand the data .
they plot it accurately and appropriately and it is reviewed by hundreds of other experts .
if you see something wrong with all of the charts it is more than likely simply a misunderstanding on you 're part rather than the entire scientific community 's .
this seems like the dunning-kruger effect in action only about data presentation instead of analysis and inference .
you were more concerned about trust and breaking trust and not concerned that she did n't like you .
edit really was n't expecting disagreement from people on this .
to be clear i 'm commenting on the op 's revealed inner-monologue .
they explain why they felt uncomfortable making a move .
in my opinion not making a move because you 're worried about the other person 's comfort/trust is a great reason .
much better than i think i 'll get rejected .
i have 2x qb288v2 and 2x qb96 elite in the same tent .
your lady looks kind of like mine which is also about one week from being chopped .
i do n't think a cooldown on abilities would fit warframe that well .
warframe is a very fast-paced game and that is part of what makes it fun .
i feel like making the abilities on cooldown would slow down the game a lot .
some levels can even be done in a few minutes and the abilities being energy-based just means that you still get to use your abilities multiple times for the shorter missions as well .
energy is also gotten mostly from killing enemies which insentivises you to keep on fighting even when you run out of energy .
a cooldown system would insentivise hiding or playing very defensivley until your abilities are no longer on cooldown .
i think a soulotion would maybe be reducing the drop-rate of energy orbs wich would also probably be easier for the devs to change .
i am not that much older than you at your age which feels like two lifetimes ago i was still very ambitious and headstrong maybe somewhat like you .
after hitting a brick wall for the umpteenth time i finally accepted i would amount to nothing ... at some point i started looking into things and seeking help in every direction possible .
i finally gave myself over to science and had myself tested on every single possible thing and had myself voluntarily committed ...
it is only then that i realised i had had some form of adhd my whole life a quick summary of adhd and possible treatments or lack thereof finally had me utterly defeated .
i was devastated to the point where even suicide seemed entirely futile ...
luckily i managed with a little help from my friends family patient professionals to pick myself back up and dig deeper into adhd and find out it so much more but also a lot less and much more complicated .
the rabbit hole goes deep very deep ... but it 's getting warmer at this depth and i am doing great better than i ever have before and thanks to nothing else but science and the curiosity to keep wanting to learn more .
there is no better expert on you than yourself a top psychiatrist will have many many patients all of whom are entirely different with a completely unique set of problems and even more possible treatments .
get informed because nobody 's going to give it for free and those that do have it they do n't wo n't sell it all at once because a cured patient is a lost patient '' .
we ca n't flame you because you are already burnt .
i just refuse to accept kanye 's behavior especially since the election and therefore will not support his music ... so i would be devistated if they made music together .

while great care should be taken when removing beasts from its ecosystem they still are remarkably resilient .
magical beasts also tend to be on the top of the ecological pyramid so their removal does n't cause the entire pyramid to collapse .
most magical beasts are n't alone in an ecosystem and most are n't very numerous either .
dragons not being present would just mean more deer for other nonmagical predators like wolves bears and ticks .
speaking of which muggles seem to have a bit of a deer problem on their hand due to overhunting on the two former predators but that is a more recent issue and frankly it is n't big enough yet for either muggle or magic governments to do much about .
mind if i repost it in the vikings sub ?

this mechanism malfunctions and the chapters start swapping back and forth between the first and second subconscious while he tries to find the man who created the procedure and have it reversed before he gets stuck in 2nd subconscious forever .
not one clue why they did n't just make every lobby a night mode to test it out lmao .

i have an old q6 edge right now and it 's not doing so hot .
granted this is a much older model although i am not sure how old it actually is .
it 's been the nicest chair i 've had up to this point but i 've had all kinds of issues with its battery its ability to handle terrain and a few other things .
i 've been looking at permobil and quickie chairs myself because i have also heard a lot of good things about them .
one of my old friends had a permobil chair for as long as i knew him and a lot of the people i knew who were in manual chairs always had quickie ones .
my backup chair is a quickie said i got second hand and it 's held up quite well since i 've been using it .
thanks for the recommendations do you think the q6 edge has made a lot of improvements between models ?
most of the people i have known of that had them always complained about the same things i complain about .
but i like to remind people that he pardoned those fuckers
the truck driver 's actions were reckless at best .
more likely his actions were malicious with intent to cause grievous bodily harm .
if he 's so concerned about his kids ' safety he should have reported any problems to the police and let them handle it .
but if you have the right tools the right machines the right processes you can cut part costs and build time .
tooling costs are just that untooled parts will be expensive and slow to build but tooling costs money .
so what you want to do is decide which rockets are going to fly often tool the parts that you use and keep flying it to recoup the up-front cost .
the first tank of one diameter is quite pricey but elongations come relatively cheap .
more important than cost it significantly reduces kct 's roll out costs which usually are more than the usual craft cost and build time .
especially in the beginning untooled rockets take forever to build

edit i downloaded map from here will see if it works yet .
i want to say whole point of this obviously is for ai to win vs human by using superior strategy and better decision-making .
but from 4th game against mana it had 800 epm microing 3 groups of blinkstalkers at the same time which no human can do on 3 places at the same time .
this ai is n't that smart yet but it is able to win simply because it plays faster than any human can and micro better than any human can .
also average epm it had 200 and mana only 170 .
tho i must say it has good target priority .
also ai will have very good target priority and spending its epm best possible way .
they need to balance epm so it wins because better strategy and proves it is smarter than humans ...
it is already very intelligent and makes good decision tho amazing .
ah i thought it the was moment with highest epm later on it had even more 1200 epm and from 1st person view it plays completely unhuman even maru ca n't play like this they need to tune this down !
it is not within human parameters by a longshot .
and it ended up with 267 epm as average while mana with 190 i saw over 200 epm average but never 267 .
i do n't even know if you can buy them here in australia .

we all will be better served by being gracious do n't you think .
someone once told me and the mrs what once you have a kid you never fully sleep again .
she knows how much we would love to see her in that position ... but i 'm taking it .
her body is pure gold and seeing dove wearing a bikini while being on her knees is a delight .

no more like if apple owned the entire surroundings to their plants and started giving people apple gift vouchers instead of money to pay their rent and for food .
and before anyone asks my example is based on real life .
what can u expect from someone who wastes time criticizing
does the reality stone modify reality or is it reality ?
manafort is not small fry to work over as a warning to others .
he 's a massive fucking crook whose had his fingers in international conflicts and made money off genocide .
him appearing in the trump campaign alone was probably setting off alarm bells that russia was involved .
he 's going down for a long time precisely because he deserves to .
his crimes are heinous and there are few in the trump campaign that are bigger fish than him .
well maybe i think he does have a personality and therefore give him that ?

i have the same issues so i concentrate on the pros that have the same play style .
then pick a map and see where they stop to check stop to throw etc .
different pros have different favourite styles or ingrained habits which is hard for them to change because of the level they play at .
we have it easier so you develop a mixture to adopt
i do n't know if this will help but i hope that it does you are not worthless or a waste do not listen to anyone that says otherwise because they only want to bring you down i know things might be difficult right now but things will get better you just have to hang in there long enough for it to happen .
these are very very similar to my 10 year olds drawings except not as good .
usually for ocd and ssri i think they recommend a higher dose not a doctor i could be totally wrong
ah fair enough yeah they should 've definitely increased quest item drops and whatnot..
but are quest item drop rates really that much of a turn off ?
all women are bad drivers '' stereotypes aside women are on their phone more often than men .
they 're also on their phone while driving more often than men .

because kentucky has an abundance of all-natural vegetable oil reservoirs all throughout the countryside making an uncommon kitchen luxury a reasonable commodity .

that 's what i do n't get.. she 's been makeup free lots but i do n't think i 've ever spotted one pimple on her face let alone really bad acne .
i 've noticed it on others like maci though .
she must be really good at hiding it somehow ?
i think there 's a gamecube in the box too .
i guess you did n't get tp karma whore this one
i think this r/s was more about her than you .
for example you said you did n't about anything her smile .
i 'm not talking about going to another place to study that 's the right thing to do .
but i myself feel that i put my so 's happiness before me .
and i think i made a mistake and no one should make it .
you must achieve a balance right from the start otherwise you 'll start to feel like this .
you must care for your own happiness as well and must not let her call the shots all the time .
sometimes is okay but not everytime otherwise the balance suffers and one person starts resenting it .
i think this is the best example in the thread .
there 's no one mastermind in the big short just a collective of self-centred individuals who can easily chalk there actions down to 'just doing their job ' .
whilst as a whole they are ruining the lives of millions .

i am fully out to my family and they 're fully supportive i have just never gone out to a family meal dressed they have only seen pictures and even so they have never seen me looking this extra thank you for your concern though it 's very sweet !
i get where youre coming from and it could be because of how i was raised .
my mom was married to my 20 year old dad at 13 .
she had me at 16 and since i was a kid i have seen and heard of the experiences she had .
my dad is pretty religious but hes on the liberal side of religion and would focus on larki ki consent ke baghair nikah nhi rather than sell your daughter as soon as she bleeds .
so i 've been pretty lucky in that regard .
at 21 i 'm already financially independent and only live with my parents because of their izzat .
i 've lived on my own in the past and often threaten to do it again if the need arises .
i think it 's about knowing your rights and not caring enough about family to ruin your life over it .
i think even if they forced me at gunpoint to get married i 'd eventually find a way to reach the police and media so i do think it matters how i live my life .
part of the reason why i wont get married even if i love someone is because i want to show pakistani girls it can be done and maybe i 'd inspire more people to pursue financial independence and break society 's norms .
hopefully they make a change a do it 12 hourly.. basically you see a llama you do n't want you can ignore it for a day..
and all the men are loser morons and the laydeys are the best and smart and they dance !
this has been mentioned countless times and is never going to happen
employers '' are people in themselves no matter how large .

how come you keep getting dogs when your dad seems to hate them ?
seems unfair to the dog and just adds unneeded problems in the family .
i 've been desperate for the last 5 years .
i 'm not the one to mope and feel sorry for myself but rent really does stab me in the neck back and knees literally .
so at the end of last year i said fuck this rent shit bit the bullet and decided to live in my car as of 7 january of this year .
the last 2-3 weeks has been a major learning curve in terms of sleeping comfortably in my car however over the last 4 days i 've been sleeping safe and sound now to the point that i 'm sleeping better now than i was in a house .
i really need to control my spending when eating i need to cut it down to 10 20 a day but i 'll get there .
any ways best of luck for the future and fuck paying rent .
ahh i see you 're a man of culture too
because she 's a hb9 and all his other incels friends from fortnite will be super jealous .
i feel like they try to look in to compatibility the first few times and when that fails they just throw out a line and try to reel in whatever they can get .
it 's too detailed and interesting to not have some sort of scripted sequence or npc .
at the very least it 's way too fucking cool a spot for me to be the only person in the red dead world to try and basically live there .
this scene has to be the greatest from the little girl we saw grow up on curb .

can you copy paste the latest successful tinder exchange ?
but the proclamation that finally linux will be mainstream for gamers has been a thing for half a decade
this becomes more true over time as more things are developed .
2012 microsoft releases windows 8 which includes its own store .
steam machines themselves ... did n't work out though .
2017 microsoft announces windows 10 s which can only run windows store apps .
microsoft states that this is their vision for the future of windows 10 .
now nvidia is n't the only decent option for linux users .
2019 proton allows playing any game more feature-complete than 2018 .
2019 windows 10 s mode is now a toggle in windows 10 .
the functionality that valve likely fears is now built-into every copy of windows 10 .
but can we get it in .35 remington no make that .35 whelen ?
only then will this be tactical enough with all the cqb crap on the tri-rail ... ..

yeah i guess he fell into the belief that hillary would win like most people thought and they could clean up the mess that way .
if it came out about the interference then hillary won people would have lost their shit about the deep state .
what obama miscalculated is that those people will lose their shit regardless and have n't earned an olive branch or the benefit of the doubt .
i hope the new generation of democrats stop falling for that act and stand up to the people who will be mad no matter what and make up bs conspiracy theories when they do n't get their way .
some not all of the fouls called for him look exactly like non-calls for a lot of other players simple as that .
yeah like my younger sister had a few guy friends when we were in school i remember the principal mentioning this to my mom once and my mom went off on the guy like hey girls can be friends with guys without being in a sexual or romantic relationship .
similarly i 've had more guy friends than friends who are girls just because for me anyway guys are just easier to chat to .
i 'm a girl but it does n't mean i 'm romantically or sexually attracted to that guy .
hell i do n't even think about sex or having a romantic relationship at all really .

a few years back a bunch of high priced vintage guitars popped up on ebay that were all smashed .
someone asked why they were selling al of these smashed guitars and the seller stated that their husband was a trash man and had found these on his trash pickup .
these were hundereds of thousands of dollars of guitars if in good condition as i recall but all were totaled .
no one was sure if that story was true .
personally i think that when the series does come to an end the creators will make it obvious .
there 's still so much to explore in petscop that i really do n't think this is anything more than a pause .

i do find people who hate our country funny i must say .
if you 're implying that about me i do n't hate your country .
if we 're both agreed on that why does the supposed possibility of london losing these jobs even upset people such as yourself ?
i just do n't like obviously wrong statements paraded with confidence in an effort to make them seem more credible .
a bit like if a person was to say something obviously ridiculous like

it sucks that i did n't get to play ww2 cos apparently they did a really good job with it wish i did play it .

darkrp is my favorite it 's just as interactive as vr with tons more dank memes and absolute cancer i love it
i have a feeling the people who will buy into this false narrative are the very same people who were up in arms about the false narrative '' surrounding the video with those racist little maga boys .
they are also probably the very same people who made the argument that private businesses have a right to deny service to anyone when that bakery refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding .
maybe it is referring to the controller being designed in seattle ?

i hike to the gardens where the dogplants sprout up in bizarre shapes from the floor of the dogscape and reach up to pluck the fetal puppyfruits right off the wagging energetic branches .
i bite into the succulent flesh the juices dribbling down my chin and dripping down to be reabsorbed by the groundflesh and revel in the savory taste .
i 'm thirsty so i range until i find one of the mothermounds and there i suckle at a teatpatch until i 've had my fill of milk .
sometimes i see other humans around me as well-adapted to the dogscape as i am but i barely acknowledge them say nothing .

in general it does n't matter what you say any anti-male post in this sub will get downvoted .

i would definitely rather see her than collins but mainers deserve to know what they are voting for .
do n't know much about the beer but this picture is just top class .
they elected her because rich white conservatives mainly resided in her district .
other than that she 's not well liked by anyone else in the state .
i remember my 8th grade english teacher even publicly saying she hated her when she was running for re-election because literally everyone else at my school hated her too .
i 'd be surprised if it was more lenient .

indicate in the letter that in the event there is a balance in the account on the date you close it you will mail the money to her .
mail a cashier 's check again using certified mail so you can prove she got the money the same day the account is closed .
the big distinction between runoff and irv are what happens to strong supporters of marginal candidates when you get down to the final 3 final 4 .
100 of their votes are going to have been reallocated or trashed .
in runoff 0 of their votes are going to be reallocated .
in approval i think a lot of them will have bullet voted .
those that are strategic will most likely have reallocated towards a viable with a ballot that looks like bullet viable others .
for the 3 person election then irv and approval essential tie .
but for the 4 person election not so much .
irv will reallocate one more time while approval very well may not .
again i could be wrong and approval end looking like irv or even slightly more central leaning .
but i do n't think it is remotely close to condorcet .
you want centerists as your top priority which it seems like you do you want condorcet .
i do n't even know how any sort of little evil can come through when you see people being this fucking shitty of human beings .
i know everyone is different but my boobs only hurt for a couple weeks if that .
it 's definitely more nerve wracking when it takes a little while to conceive .
but it 's also totally normal for it to take a year since cycles and ovulation can vary so much .
we were actually the only couple we know able to conceive before 1 year .
every one else who got pregnant did so after a year and with a little assistance and two couples are still trying .
so i know a little bit at least second hand about the stress it can bring .
i know the feeling of 8 weeks ca n't cine soon enough '' though !
what makes spo a great coach outside of the big 3 ?
the best record spo had after the big 3 was in 2015-16 with 48 wins .
and this is in the eastern conference mind you .
so what is the bar exactly when you say good to great coach '' ?
do you really want me to post my mental health shit and how i was dealing with childhood abuse ?
because they fight with baguettes and their military is more powerful at the start of the game
i 've coached a lot of athletes and it 's not uncommon for people to get injured and do almost nothing and build back to 90 95 of best in 1 or 2 cycles .
this happens with cyclists a lot and almost every cyclist i ever coached could get pretty damn close to that figure above within 2 tests .
the real freaks were nfl or college football players .
they 'd party and eat like shit in the off-season a lot of the time come back sorry and pathetic and after a single training camp had seemingly shed all the fat and were putting up damn good lifts and sprint times .
with climbing i think the time course of tendon adaptations changes this a lot .

honestly you should push valk to e3 or at least 10 star asap .
the rest of your 6 stars or higher are trash tier .
then get heart watcher to 6 and get destroyer to 6star and leave him there with no gear .

real shocker that posting freedom oriented memes that you do n't even agree with got you a bunch of upvotes on a libertarian sub but you only did it by misrepresesenting yourself so it 's hardly an achievement .
you should run for office you 've got the two-faced thing down pat .
lol as a libertarian all i did was cross post memes from r/enlightenedcentrism into r/libertarian
i was so secretive https np.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/9leepg/z/e77imrl about it too .
i 'm sure there 's https np.reddit.com/r/libertarian/comments/9ah0d7/z/e4wrs38 no reason whatsoever .

they 'd need to add code for carrying and aiming a gun and stuff .
this is trivial the real challenge is having the ai decide what to do with the guns .
anytime you have a crap car a lemon multiple wrecks someone killed inside whatever .
it 's a way of getting rid of a problem .
i would advise you not buy any car that has been wrecked .
the dealer will tell you it 's a fender bender but you never know it could have really fucked up the car .
as far as the price no dealer is going sell a car below market value especially a car like a honda civic unless they already know it has issues '' .

when i was in my 20s i got picked up hitchhiking by a woman in her 40s .
we changed route and headed back to her place .
she poured drinks and started to be kind of annoying but it was clear the sex was going to happen so i tolerated the behavior .
by the time she was out of her clothes though my enthusiasm had waned .
i maybe rushed things a little bit and she was pissed to be unsatisfied .
she had promised a ride back but when she sent me out to her car she slammed to door and turned off all exterior lighting .
my walk home was a lot longer than our might have been .
i think a 10 year old wrote these rules up

after so many missions andrew 's got nerves of steel but even he could n't help but feel seriously threatened by kyouki 's look .
he knows there 's no point in asking for his surrender but maybe he can minimize casualties .

introduce yourself on some of those sites and you will get some good feedback and chances are someone will offer you a test ride in your area ... ..it 's hard to judge a bike without riding it but most dealers do n't welcome test drives .

however the relative varying maximums apply even to 401 k s. that is 19,000 after tax is effectively more than 19,000 before taxes so it can make sense to use roth if you 're hitting the cap either way .
what priyanandan did could be accounted for under this section .
then a complaint should 've been lodged with the cops .
he should be criticized/booker for inflammatory comments against religion but and what sanghparivar did is wrong .
it 's disheartening to see the profound lack of self-restraint and disrespect for the law from sanghis especially about the sabarimala issue .
what 's worse is their leadership is by their silence encouraging and enabling such criminal activities .
well he has a whole book about how the old testament is distracting and should just be not used paraphrasing .
check out kruger 's review of the book it 's in another comment .
the problem is you ca n't just drop ‚Öî of the bible and justify it by saying that it 's keeping people from coming to christ .

the ability to destroy thousands more should call his charter rights into question .
some people would argue that being part of a society and reaping it 's benefits would assume that such a person would n't do something to cause it harm .
this is a massive amount of shit that will destroy a massive amount of lives .
i can subscribe to the idea of his rights were violated '' if it was something small scale but there 's got ta be maximum limits to that kind of leniency .
dude is small time throwing 10 bags around '' vs dude smuggled 27,500 pills of fentanyl that will statistically result in x many deaths . ''
i 'd propose a maximum limit that street level drug traffickers could have to avoid larger conspiracy charges and legislation to prohibit the presence of excess narcotics in a crime scene from being ruled inadmissable unless there 's ample evidence of cases being unrelated to eachother .

this can actually be proven because the library editions of the comics come with commentary from both gene and mike about the conversations they had on how to use the comics to bridge into korra .
i did n't know that was happening i like lolo !
my only beef is with ricky but he 'll be safe this week as well i 'm sure .
it appears to be a light variant as far as i can tell

i felt like valentina and naomi did a solid safe performance .
from the challenge i thought the trio was in the bottom and maybe latrices dress would save her from the bottom two but she barely spoke at all during the challenge .
overall v confused and side note i thought this was the best valentina has ever looked
the k.o.d guy is definitely going to be in paine when he wakes up .
yeah because the actual brainwashing and government control of knowledge and culture in north korea is at the same level in the us .
we have smartphones reddit and wikipedia and can think and say anything we want short of incitement .
do you really think people in north korea can say the same ?
damn i guess i 'll just stick with lm1 since my other mages need the black magic abilities .
or have our son asking people why daddy wears a collar .
my subsband wears a day collar we just call it a necklace i mean that 's really what it is technically and our kids have never thought twice about it luckily
more than happy to take the ls in this thread but may i point out our 2nd place finish ?
i do n't have a lot of trust in ea .
these reeks of middle schooler who just found porn and is the coolest guy in gym class
but that was literal intent of the h-1b visa program .
to lower the wages of high skilled work by importing a work force that is malleable and less expensive than american born workers .
usually if a documentary says that some scenes are dramatized it 's referring to brief re-enactments of events for visual purposes .
it 's not bad because it provides a visual so you 're not just seeing talking heads and photos .
but documentaries and reality tv are not the same thing .
reality tv especially those ratchet housewives shows are awful .
so fun fact i looked at the black windswept on my windswept present which had a regular unpainted windswept and the unpainted one is more black than the black painted one .
what does jump force have to do with death stranding or the ruse ?

those words were written by the valley news editorial board .
at my school all teachers have a key to the school building and an alarm code .
a lot of teachers do work late but it 's not expected at all .
the key is mostly so it 's an option so we do n't have to bother anyone if we go in during weird hours .
i 'm really productive at night so sometimes when i ca n't sleep i 'll go over to my school at 1 am and just clean my classroom or do some work .

can you imagine if nott had died right there or any point earlier in the campaign and no one ever learned about her real backstory .
you invest in new business ideas and get them off the ground ie people poorer than you and you make money off or your cut .
what is the extent of the jougan 's abilities ?
it 's the only one we 've seen in all of the naruto franchise so it better be something good .
given the fact that it has abilities of the byakugan seeing the chackra pathway and determines the main/weak chackra point as well and has other abilities as well then it has to be good .
especially given the fact that it comes from boruto and before someone says that it is stated to be a power of the otsutski remember both naruto and hinata have otsutski chackra in canon naruto got his from hagoromo and hinata got her 's from hamura in naruto the last and it 's stated that he gave her his chackra and that hinata inherited it from him even when hinata gives naruto chackra in 2 seconds she states it that hamura 's chackra flows within me so yeah that 's why momoshiki states that .
i know the jougan will be good and crazy powerful .
her eyes are and appear to be able to see an attack e.g .
rasengan and emit that attack back out again whenever the user wishes .
it 's basically the same thing as momoshiki 's hand and naruto 's fake hand as well .
well they ended up with a winner so mission accomplished for them .
it 's been on a roll for about 10 years now .
lol at all these sooks mad at the fact the british created the best country in the world .
i do n't tell her that she 's not real .
if she ever found out she 'd leave me .
how exactly does rockstar make more money after you payed for the game ?
you seem to have set an incredibly narrow goal .
your chances of success are essentially less than those of someone trying to be a sports star .
you might want to set a more reasonable goal .
you might also want to look at having goals in life beyond what college you go to what grades you get or what job you have .
work is part of it but so is eating drinking laughing loving etc .
as to your sister she may have a life you never see .
if you want to help her then reach out and be real .
do n't put your goals and wants into it .
do n't tell her how to fix herself you will lose her .
it 's so frustrating not to have the words to express yourself properly and logically .
just because a product is refundable does n't make it immune from criticism .
a non-functional/falsely advertised product should be blasted so that this does n't continue as a common business practice
i mean that would require literally any level of artistic talent to be fair .
i love this part of the update so much .
i recommend cs style where your crouching gets slower each time you do it .
i woulda tried to find the person farming them off the hook if they were on death hook .
if the game was falling out of your favor and you could n't find the guy who unhooked her quickly then you are right to hook her again

here is a game he played with messi busquets and pique
u/closeyourlegs out here with the hot take that ... fiction does n't have the ability to educate ?
also i can find you several major critics lists that do n't include those films that were n't labeled racist .
in fact i do n't recall any critics lists being labeled racist apart from reviews from people like jeff wells that straight-up included racist remarks .
i do n't think a ryanair flight is the best way to get over a fear of flying .
the roughest landing i 've ever had was with them .
is your name pam or is that just what you spray on your face ?
i should n't have to be specific about dealing with a break up on a sub about break ups just in case someone comes along and uses completely different comparisons that are n't even related to the conversation like death and child abandonment .
you took what i said and made it into another topic of discussion altogether .
can someone tell me when the pepper spray to the face starts so i do n't have to watch a half hour interaction
i like people that tell me i 'm wrong but do n't actually even try to say why .
i definitely do n't work in this industry or something literally at a company developing technology for exactly this reason or something .
even remind the company in this article has to pay money for sms fees .
they use a gateway provider called twilio it 's actually stated in the article .
i 'm familiar with twilio because i 've used them when developing software for pbx/sms .
you will find that no matter where you go you have to pay a flat rate per sms .
twilio probably gives remind bulk pricing that saves them fuck tons of money .
then reminder makes their money through advertising or selling user data .
so they eat the sms fees and provide a free service for sms by selling user data or whatever marketing trick they do to make money that any free '' service does .
there 's no such thing as that for email .
if you setup an email server you can send as many emails as you want for free provided it 's within your bandwidth .
the other server providers might block you for spamming them .
because there 's no gateway that 's charging you fees .
do you really want to challenge me on that ?
it 's also a point that artists are n't supposed to grow up .
would the rolling stones be a better band if they had grown up and stopped playing rock music and jumping around all the time ?
creativity and imagination are connected to youth some artists lose it as they age and none want to .
damn i 'd take a feast in hell over a feast in heaven .
yo i 'm high af on a cruise ship and i am so down on this meme .
siri show me a 2019 lib distilled to it 's purest form .
bernie sanders was too distracted by the need to bury evidence of sexual harassment by his campaign to bother standing up against putin .
the government 's safety nets is a thing you know .
season 4 true ending lilly has killed all of clem 's squad .
lilly points a gun at aj saying some evil monologue and making sure clem has to watch him die .
right before her finger pulls the trigger robo kenny 3000 and ascended revenant lee burst in lee tackles her while robo kenny does a 8 foot jump in the air to slam dunk a salt lick onto her head .
in fact it made it far easier by saying i 'm not drinking .
setting a 1 month goal would be good to gauge how you like it .
then with a clear mind decide your next course of action .
guys i called vox cinemas it will probably be released this wednesday
yeah in all honesty i think it 'll be us heat and you guys as the 7th and 8th .
obvious bias but also because the heat are a second half of season kind of team i think we 'll snag 7th and you guys have 8th .
you definitely look better than the pistons right now and i ca n't see the wizards or magic fighting back into the picture .

quatar is a country of millions of people who are all different .
some are complete shit bags but many probably the majority are normal people you could have a coffee with and talk sports with any time .
why just because things are bad in some areas ca n't we look towards creating something that is pleasant for the majority ?
allowing the populace to feel part of a major international event ?
screw the politicians who want to use it as prestige they can go suck on an egg but let people who enjoy sports share into a great experience .
to quote hans rosling things can be bad and getting better at the same time .
they tend to have discounted or free tickets to local venues especially to the theatre and museums in the surrounding areas .
all you have to do is show proof of residence .
you 're already paying for this luxury through taxes so take advantage of it .

i have an adorable tiny niece who despite being pretty smart in some ways used to believe that if she dreamed of me i would know what had happened in her dream because after all i had been there !
that conversation made it on my internal list of perfect moments i hope i will never ever forget
also we 're you one of the people hurt directly by the shutdown ?
i would say some of the casting is better though it 's also hard to compare because there 's less screentime .
i think violet 's actress in the movie was perfect for the role though .
i know the lea and perrins story is that it came from a bengali king or whatever but my opinion is that 's just a marketing story and that the true inspiration was rather more close to home .
i 'm in the small camp that really enjoyed re6 .

ranging from people who have no idea why classics are considered classics people forcing others to read just like high school which many hate !
and people who complain about their partners not reading fiction with hard magic systems while they do n't read classics or anything that does n't start with b and ends with randon .
but i mean of course no one will read shakespeare since brandon sanderson improved his magic systems .
it would be when that self righteousness becomes a problem that an issue would arise anyhow god or no god

i started writing when i was really young around the time i was learning to read .
i did n't know to copy a style at that point and my parents never gave me pointers or how-to guides .
i started writing things i dreamed my what ifs the weird images and thoughts that popped into my head and my imagination just kind of kept expanding .
it 's still developing and changing each time i write something different or challenging .
it 's what makes writing and the whole process fun !

when people are told medicare for all means a guaranteed right to health care 78 percent support it .
when people are told it means eliminating private insurance 37 percent support it .
a survey released by the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation on wednesday comes as democratic presidential hopefuls embrace the idea of a government-run healthcare system .
the poll found that 56 percent of americans initially support medicare-for-all '' compared with 42 percent who oppose the policy .
those numbers can shift dramatically when people are given additional information .
support increases to 71 percent when people learn medicare-for-all '' would guarantee a right to health insurance but if they were told that a government-run system could lead to delays in getting care or higher taxes support plunges to 26 percent and 37 percent respectively .

it may sound clich√© at this point but talk with an advisor i would highly recommend going in during drop-in hours and speaking to marykatherine !
because they will be able to send you in the right direction .
also would recommend checking out the english undergraduate organization or shooting them an email .
they are great at setting up connections for people especially since the new leadership i think their names are rachel and michael ?
and can get you going in the right direction !
let me know if you have any questions and best of luck in your coding adventure !

just to be clear telling your wife not to take a good job because it makes you insecure is very different from what you said .

op is 6'1 and 195lbs but still looks like he does n't lift ?
i 'm not sure where the real issue is nor what 's the standard in op social circle unless op has a very high body fat percentage 20
if op had low body fat around 10 or less 195lbs for 6'1 would already be around the natural limit .
so judging by only the number it 's almost impossible for you to look like a guy who does n't lift .
do n't look for others ' approval you 'll never fill this empty hole of insecurity .

was it wrong of s4 to die 6 times on doom in 5 minutes or was that sumail 's fault
i actually used to have very good insurance and went to the er twice when i had beyond beyond painful flare ups .
i 'd go in in the middle of the night let them see and explain that i 'm in terrible pain they 'd take me in .
both times i got pain medicine and the first time the pain went away almost immediately with it .
made me do scans and stuff but because of my good insurance everything total was always 50 .
i 'd pay the insurance person at the end of the several hour process and move on .
i suppose because i only did it twice they never really suspected anything .
and i never lied about what was wrong because in theory it could 've been something more .
plus both times i could n't stop throwing up .
people dont believe me when i said i was a problem child growing up .
i 've done a lot of things to hurt myself and others .
once i turned 18 i cleaned my act up because i was legally an adult .

that or i 'm an immortal being that could n't die no matter how hard i tried .

i see complaining about maybe a half dozen bugs here when it used to be dozens .
give credit where credit is due i 'd say .
unless someone just ca n't find it in themself to acknowledge that they are putting work in .
i rate the game very highly and even i 'll agree they should 've had a longer beta and avoided the temptation of releasing for the holidays .
insert cliche hurr durr but da game is still in alpha '' joke here .
if they were here at release there 'd be much less bemoaning .
but of course it 's bethesda so people will always complain some for legit reasons and for some just because they want to .
side note other massive multiplayer online games that people adore now had rough releases .
i give the game a year year and a half before a lot of people finally put down their rage canvas bags and leave the it just works '' memes at the door and just play the damn game .
sure there 'll be people who are so grudged they just will not leave it alone .
but luckily the rest of us who genuinely enjoy the game can tune it out and just play .

by upgrading to 32gb op probably forced his motherboard to run the memory in dual channel mode which effectively doubled the bandwidth to his ram .
i bet his 16gb ram was just 1 stick of ram which can only run in single channel mode .
or if it was 2 8gb sticks it was improperly plugged into the motherboard .
it 's important to make sure you put the ram sticks in the right slots to take advantage of dual channel mode .
you ca n't just put them in any old slots and expect them to work in dual channel mode .

if you do n't have the time to read it here are some good quotes from here which belong on this sub
credit is the economic judgment on the morality of a man .
in credit the man himself instead of metal or paper has become the mediator of exchange not however as a man but as the mode of existence of capital and interest .
the medium of exchange therefore has certainly returned out of its material form and been put back in man but only because the man himself has been put outside himself and has himself assumed a material form .
within the credit relationship it is not the case that money is transcended in man but that man himself is turned into money or money is incorporated in him .
human individuality human morality itself has become both an object of commerce and the material in which money exists .
instead of money or paper it is my own personal existence my flesh and blood my social virtue and importance which constitutes the material corporeal form of the spirit of money . ''
... as long as man does not recognize himself as man and therefore has not organized the world in a human way this community appears in the form of estrangement because its subject man is a being estranged from himself . ''
we are to such an extent estranged from man 's essential nature that the direct language of this essential nature seems to us a violation of human dignity whereas the estranged language of material values seems to be the well-justified assertion of human dignity that is self-confident and conscious of itself . ''
our mutual value is for us the value of our mutual objects .
hence for us man himself is mutually of no value . ''

i 'm not into metal but here 's my two cents .
i worked at one of those guitar based lesson studios and everyone there was into metal including my manager .
that gives me a whole 5th to work with of range .
with guitar players exploring ever deeper territory it 's only right that basses reclaim it .
i suggest using a bassist who 's into the drop range say for example a 5 string in drop a as the deeper bassist and using a standard tuning or even tenor tuned bass as the second bass .
it brings to mind that the double bass is named from it 's doubling of the cello part which was traditionally considered the bass and who 's range is similar to an extended range guitar .
no it 's not because that 's the worst of all worlds that no-one wants .

so the antagonist is this guy manga title s that saw the opportunity to make his own rule and pretty much was starting to create a dictatorship being able to hand pick who would be able to live on this new world choosing from the petrified humans who would be brought back and who would be broken now the group of the antagonist has their own abilities but they do n't really rely on science to do battle of course everyone uses it but the bad guys are focusing on something else meanwhile the protagonist is using the power of science to step by step move forward for pretty much everything and i mean everything . ''
but the villain was never the goal to be defeated the main goal of the story the challenge is to rebuild civilisation all the way to the space era to bring back all 7 billion humans .

when he was born i demanded a dna test and the results came back that he was mine she broke up with him because he shunned our son .
so we got back together and about a year later she cheated on me her first sons dad again .
after missing my sons birth i guess being there for our daughters blinded me to a lot of the way she was acting .
after i her dna test i tried to stay and work it out i loved her .
the baby girl but i was away working and my friend sent me her tinder profile .
i then proceeded to spend 10k just to prove in court i should be in our sons life 50 of the time .
the first thing she did when we split was remove me from the daughters birth certificate the only reason i 'm not raising her/paying child support is because she was collecting from her real father .
so i guess i proceeded in a rough few months of watching this little girl who knew me as daddy stop calling me daddy .
i 'm still in her life as much as i can be i still sing to her everytime i see her .
her face still lights up when she sees me .
i guess i continue to love her and hope she never stops loving me .
she is such a wholesome and amazing companion keeps getting better .

i think part of ops complaint is that if there were extra steps required to make the food look like it does in the book maybe it should be included in the recipe even as optional steps at the end
optional step 7 replace cooked meat and veggies with painted styrofoam .
because those are the types of tricks he 's talking about .
i agree it 's perhaps even more misleading to do this in a cook book showing something you can allegedly create than say a pic on a cereal box or a mcdonald 's commercial .
but most food wont look pretty unless you know how to make it look pretty which is not always the same thing as preparing it well .
most people who cook understand this is the case .
... and many people are aware that food photography is largely bullshit as well ...
just to be clear you are n't disputing any of those points ?
there are a huge number of variables involved in an actual societal/human dynamic that are not represented in your calculation .
the most important of which are time and timing as already stated .

it has acetaminophen in it plus helps with other pms period stuff
ok. give me a minute to boot back up .
but still that movie is 7 months away and disney has plenty of other high profile releases before it .
i think they might have one or two more just because how many huge releases there are this year .
but i 'd say captain marvel endgame aladdin and toy story 4 are all more likely .
i do n't think they 'll want lion king to take the spotlight from aladdin in the disney classic remakes department .
they still need to build proper hype for it .
i would n't necessarily be surprised if we got a lion king spot but i would n't put money on it .
they also have to pay for the rent on the studio and buisness property in nyc must be insane .
best case scenario you 'll probably be a labourer doing work for an hourly wage and maybe a tiny scrap of the profit .
worst case scenario you 'll be sucked in to some sort of scam or pyramid scheme .
since this involves seminars '' and is mass-advertised on the radio i 'm leaning towards the latter .

i am not a dentist but had a similar experience with my tooth extraction .
i was really really paranoid about getting dry socket and had one wisdom and one premolar removed at the same time .
the wisdom felt fine but my premolar was throbbing for at least a week .
this tooth had a really bad infection before being pulled so i think this contributed to the pain due to the extra swelling i already had .
i was so worried about the appearance and colour inside the socket because it turned white and i had the throbbing pain .
the white colour is mostly because that 's just how things look when they heal jn our oral cavities .
think of getting wounds on your lips or cheeks the healing tissues turns white .
i called my dentist and they assured me it was normal and that dry socket pain is really really horrible .
if you are still feeling really worried you should call your dentist so they can make appropriate treatment plans for you if it is dry socket .
my guess is no but i am not a medical professional .
every advancement of civilisation has been because of science .
none came about because of the 'thoughts and prayers ' of a religion .
you can only assert that erroneous and egregious idea to us because of science .
who regarded scientific enquiry as a worse sin than lust also said that hell was made for the inquisitive '' .
to seek to discover more was a sin and therefore also a crime the crime of curiositas .
for him scientific curiosity knowledge and learning '' was as a more serious sin than lust .
science has continuously uprooted gods from their comfortable locations and pushed them to the tiny back corners and farthest reaches of reality .
there is no room for a god anywhere in the universe nor the blind stupidity of your st augustine .
those 'theories ' are frameworks of understanding and are built of tried and tested facts .
those theories have put men on the moon sent our presence to all the other worlds and outside of this solar system have fed billions more than your prayers ever could eradicated diseases your puny ineffectual god could not and let 's you communicate around the world instantly .
how big a hypocrite does one have to be to use a computer to say what great things has science done ? ''

i do n't get the whole gaming elitism thing it 's not like by playing a more complex/challenging game that you 've found a cure for cancer .
people should play whatever makes them happy i 'm a console guy but if someone 's thing is playing candy crush on their tablet/phone let them enjoy gaming on whatever platform suits them .
i could let my mum be suckered in by apps like 'candy crush ' or i can get her a ds or a cheap pc and get her playing games like 'zuma 's revenge ' or 'peggle ' .
games that have all the same draw to them but with no micro-transactions and that are n't purposely built so that you always lose at certain levels unless you pay money .
there are always real game alternatives to any of these shitty mobile apps that wo n't try and gouge you for money and not trying to steer people towards the former and away from the later is frankly mean .
i am not a huge fan of phone or tablet games myself but the games have improved hugely over the years and there 's obviously a market .
back when games like 'plants vs zombies ' and 'rayman jungle run ' came out on mobile in 2009 and 2012 respectively and when they where porting entire console experiences like 'gta 3 ' and 'the amazing spiderman ' to mobile they had a legit alternative to handheld systems like the ds and psp and people thought the 3ds and vita would be crushed by smartphones ... but no .
premium crack cocaine has a market that does n't mean we should fucking encourage it or be ok when they start slipping bits of cocaine into other food .
because that 's what mobile apps are they 're dangerous and addictive and now their monitisation methods are finding their way into real mainstream games .
i get the skinning thing though but however is it any different to developers releasing a game on console for 70 quid then less than a few months later selling dlc for it ?
the cod franchise is a classic example selling weapon skins and so on so for me there 's not much difference in afraid .
'star wars battlefront 2 ' for example is n't really a game it 's a piece of shit designed to advertise and sell loot-boxes .
it looks like a game from the outside but really it 's just a disgusting vehicle for selling micro-transactions and gambling to children and the psychologically vulnerable .
as more and more games become infested with this shit games like 'assassin 's creed odyssey ' and the upcoming 'devil may cry 5 ' for example .
they 're taking something that is a game and infecting it with this shit ...
if a mobile phone app is a gram of cocaine and a video game is a meal at a restaurant then something like 'assassin 's creed odyssey ' is a really nice chicken curry that some cunt sprinkled a little cocaine into ... you might not notice but it 's still wrong and we should fight against it .
stuff like 'star wars battlefront 2 ' however is a fast food burger that 's been completely coated with cocaine .
at this point the food is n't even that good the only reason people keep eating it is they 're addicted to the cocaine and if people do n't stop getting suckered into this kind of shit we wo n't have any food left that does n't have a little cocaine in it and i do n't want that shit in my food .

depend how much proc you have on ctp of energy .
but you need at least 180-200 proc on your double lightning obelisk so t3 thor can really shine .
mine has 180 proc on double lightning obelisk 38.6+36.4 and he does quite well although ctpe with 200 is way better .
as ctp of energy are rare i would recommend building double lightning obelisk or combination of lightning damage crit dmg or crit rate 180/200 proc .

you managed to make me hate the loli trio somehow

if somebody can quit cold turkey they can generally just as easily use moderation .
generally if they can quit all together they can practice moderation .
and i think that 's a better goal to strive for .
and yes i also understand that some people can not practice moderation and have to quit cold turkey if it 's negativity impacting their life so much .
but i think people should try for moderation first .
and then if that does n't work then go cold turkey but only if that does n't work .
but i wan na ask if someone wants to just play videogames all day and never do anything else why should they feel bad for that if that 's what make them happy ?
if it makes you happy is it really negatively impacting your life ?
or are people telling you that it 's negatively impacting your life ?
it is n't uncommon for animals to protect other species young .
understandably it is also not uncommon to specifically hunt young because they are vulnerable but remember reading about a cheetah or something that brought a baby monkey back into where its tribe kinda was after the cat found its mother dead or something .

to think i 'm one sleep away from this title i ca n't believe it 's real
i should very much like to touch it again ...
i feel like what 's missing here is that the pnw area usually gets a little snow which starts melting a bit then freezes overnight .
if it were just montana-style snow drifts that stayed snow we 'd be ok it 's all the ice that gets iffy .
what you say should n't make sense because that 's not how the cognitive functions work but honestly for all intents and purposes in real life that 's pretty much what i see .
gaslighting manipulate someone by psychological means into questioning their own sanity .
from infancy i was taught that i as a mortal was 'an enemy unto god ' that my natural views of morality and ethics were fallen and corrupted .
i was taught to abandon what i thought was right and wrong and instead embrace their authoritative statements as eternal reality .
i was taught to 'doubt my doubts ' about lgbt doctrine being wrong or doctinre on blacks and the priesthood being wrong .
i was taught my sanity was not good enough to know true right from wrong and that i needed prophets and apostles to tell me what is right and what is wrong .
then as people start to see through this and trust more what they actually see feel and know we again are taught to 'lean not unto thine own understanding ' we are taught that those that abandon the claims of the church are really deceived wandering in darkness and unhappy when the exact opposite is typically true .
when people start to notice historical claims have been changed or altered or abandoned the church then slyly tries to rewrite history claiming 'it was always taught like this ' and 'its your fault you trusted 'mortal prophets speaking as men ' instead of learning this for yourself ' etc .
the historical revisioninsm continues even with little things like lying about the expected number of missionaries out today holland confidently predicted/expected 100,000 youth full time missonaries yet the press release said the actual number of 65,000 'was expected ' instead of the much higher number that did not materialize .
subtle little lies and distortions to get people to doubt what they really knew and to embrace the 'new narrative ' .
the purpose of gaslighting after all is control over the preson who can no longer trust themselves who then must trust you instead .
when people over and over claim the temple ordiances do n't need to be changed because the leaders have said so and then claim the new changes to the temple are so welcome and good because the leaders say so even though these are completely contradictory if the change was good and welcome and an improvement this means that prior to the change a change was needed for improvement contrarty to what leaders said before i 'd say the gaslighting has been effective .
they have abandoned their own thinking and embrace whatever the leaders tell them even if it flies in the face of reality and is proveably wrong because they no longer trust their own selves and what they think feel and know instead deferring to what church leaders tell them .
over and over and over again the church tries to get us to abandon our own sanity and all the recorded verifiable information that proves them wrong and embrace their version of reality inspite of what we think know or feel .
doubt your doubts ' 'doubt yourself ' 'doubt your worthiness to think for yourself ' 'everything has been answered ! '
despite zero answers actually given especially officialy and on and on and on .
i 'd say gaslighting is actually fairly accurate as to what is going on as the church has to slowly abandon the ardent and proveable claims on reality of the past and move towards a more allegorical less literal narrative one where 'translate really means 'inspired '' and the like and where science can no longer continually prove their claims wrong .
and they ca n't do this if the members trust themselves more than they trust what they say and what they need them to believe in order to make that happen .
i had n't even noticed the s-rank guaranteed in 29 drops '' part of that screenshot so i was replying to the rest of it in my defense there was never a countdown there back when i was rolling standard .

it is a form of mental illness even though people pretend it isnt .
i think the bigger issue here is the stigma that is associated with the term mental illness .
just because someone is mentally ill does not mean he is some sort of a lesser person .

first they see a psychiatrist and then are prescribed usually hormone therapy pills and or surgery now if that does not sound like curing illness i do n't know what does .

he had a very hard role to pull off he was both a menacing charming and unpredictable cult leader a la manson but also a guy who was really deep down just blowing smoke and 'performing ' these attributes .

i had a colleague run into the store at 7am morning shifts staff at 6am apologising profusely for being late .
it hurt to have to tell them that they were actually on the closing shift that day and were n't due to start until 2pm .

even sanctioned tournaments run at regular rules enforcement level do n't require certified judges .
most sanctioned events that would be held at competitive rel would require a certified judge and the ones that do n't still likely want one .
an unsanctioned event would likely only need a certified judge if your event were to draw more than 32 players and that 'd just be to help it run smoother logistically not necessarily for rules knowledge .

if cesaro cares about being a ‚Äòpro wrestler ' he should leave wwe as soon as he can .
if it 's his dream to ‚Äòsports entertain ' and have ‚Äòwrestlemania moments ' and all that jazz he 's in the right place .
either way he should not be losing to pink-faced attention whore shane mcmahon .

the odds of running into someone who can trace your ip let alone someone who would ... you should be fine as long as you are n't a large streamer or have people actively trolling you .
it really would be a us roleplay because even though americans will claim their political ideology is the best they never install them abroad .
that 's because sucking at something is the first step of being kinda sorta good at it !
i would n't buy a filco these days leopold is just better and they are quite expensive .
if you can find a cheap masterkeys that 's not a bad option they at one point went for about 50 which is a killer price for a board like that .
that said i honestly do n't quite see the point they make sense for boards where no programmable alternative exists like the topre boards but if you just want a tkl why not just get one that 's programmable anyway like the xd87 or kbd8x ?
i understand what you 're going through because i feel that way right now .

i started writing seriously because it was more efficient than drawing out my stories as comics .
it has taken me eight years to get to the point where i can reliably write a good book of trade publishable length .
it 'll probably take me eight more years to get the book deal .
with my fiction writing i have gone on hiatus because of my husband 's illness but this year my aim is to get reading again i do n't think i finished one single book after about march last year and then get writing .
at the moment though i 'm doing a lot of knitting and crochet as well as learning to draw things as well as people and in terms of writing i 'm really trying to improve my essay skills here on reddit and on facebook .
getting better at precision and concision is one goal and another is to be assertive of my own position without getting too aggressive .

i 've removed your post since someone else has already posted about this event here https old.reddit.com/r/superstarbts/comments/aklesp/attendance_every_day_event_128_226_12am_kst .
if you 'd like to share this longer event page in the comments on that thread i 'm sure everyone would appreciate it .
if i see just a line with no notation by default i would only think it 's straight up bet .
but in this case the line difference between the 2 types of bets were so large i 'd assume i had the wrong bet
yeah nobody has said that stuff and i 'm loving these view points .
my main motivators are definitely that to not feel like a waste of space but also to please other people which is a very fucked up way of thinking i do need to find a new motivator .
whether that be loving and cherishing my new house or to make me feel better and living in a clean and healthy environment .
this journey is already kinda scary and it 's only been a few hours lol
the hek with a potato will easily clear you up to the end of the starchart as well as the earlier parts of poe and fortuna .
but you 'll need better stuff for endgame content like highend poe/fortuna .
either a hek with a ton of forma in it or a better weapon like the vaykor hek .
i am dealing with this sort of stuff now in my late thirties .
i saw in another comment you made you seem to somewhat freshly cracked and it sounds like you may not have any people you are out to irl .
the abridged version of my story is basically that i worked my way up to coming out to people who i thought might be unsupportive .
do n't start with the most difficult people in your life .
when you say you are closeted do you have any irl friends who know that you are transgender ?
if not then i would n't recommend starting with the people in your life who are the least likely to be supportive .
having said that i had to come out to my wife first because my realization had a large and direct impact on her life .
the second person i came out to though was a volunteer at trans lifeline .
really that was first conversation i had actually had with another trans person .
i will always be grateful to that person for listening to me .
it was good to at least have one person who i could talk to that was safe .
at the time i was terrified and had spent the last 30 years trying to make sure nobody discovered that aspect if my life .
the third person i came out to was my therapist .
that was necessary for my therapy but really it was just good to have a second safe person to talk to .
so if you have n't already you may want to see if there 's a youth lgbt group in your area to expand your support network .
i then kinda worked my way through some of the professional relationships i have with lgbt people .
eventually i was able to talk to my sister who is lesbian and thought would at least be understanding .
now she 's is one of my biggest supporters and confidants .
although i am older i was still worried about telling my mother .
i ran scenarios through my head but what eventually moved me to reach out to her was thinking about how good it would feel if she knew .
it was n't for sure that she would accept me .
she had disowned my sister years ago when she came out .
they eventually reconciled but it was certainly on my mind .
so it actually turned out as well as i could hope .
my mother was understandably confused as i had kept my gender identity issues from her but said that she loved me .
so anyway that is my story for what it 's worth .
no that 's a very useful critique thanks for that .
if i do something like this again i should probably think of ways of making those things more prominent .
it only matters what the your gaming group thinks and the gm of the 1st campaign because people can get angry about strange things .
there 's a difference between can i do it ? ''
and can i do it without anyone getting angry '' .
no external comitee will come and judge you for it .
but that 's kinda obvious so i assume you have discussed it with your gaming group and they agreed .
i guess what you 're asking is if your gaming group is ok with the idea what 's the risk that you wo n't like the outcome .
it all depends on your gaming style and the events of first campaign .
if you 're very immersive and very player=character then returning to a setting has more pitfalls than if you 're more about the story then the immersion .
but that 's really hard to predict without knowing you all .
maybe write more about your groups style of playing and we 'll help you figure out what to watch out for ?
about the events if the first campaign was big and say fixed the world 's main problem why play another ... ?
unless with fixing it also introduces another big problem .
think about the campaign as a movie or tv series would you be happy if you learned it has a sequel ?
or are you asking can you even suggest the idea to your group without sounding like a total jerk ?
if they get mad they 're being weird not you .
there 's nothing inherently objectvely wrong with the idea itself .
i can and do enjoy music taken as a whole but the mumbling feels ... low quality .
it does n't feel up to the standard of the rest of the song .
i dunno it 's one of those things that just plain does n't work for me .

my best friend went to college near me and we hung out all the time with his college buddies .
he had this one friend '' everyone called hajji he was a bit of a prick but he paid for a lot of stuff so everyone let him hang out .
one night at a bar he got so wasted he couldnt stand up .
the cops came and were asking for his id .
he fumbled his wallet out and handed the cop his ultra black credit card .
the cop gave it back and was like no no i need your id . ''
hajji blinked squinted at his cc then up at the cop and very deliberately handed him his cc again .
horse sized dogs not on a leash in the middle of the night .
that 's pretty impressive but i 'm betting that it only works on certain makes and models .
if that little gap at the top of the door is minuscule i 'm guessing it 's very difficult to get leverage to pop it like that .
unless you just say fuck it and go gta and break the window .
edit i 'm pretty sure that 's an older model honda civic .
i do n't think the windows were made as part of the whole car frame .
which is why he 's able to bend it like that then reach down and unlock the door .

i think there are plenty of people out there who find ways to get their audio books for free .
as consumers we can find things to listen to on piracy sites keep creating new '' accounts like you are talking about or other ways to get media for free .
i think what keeps people from doing things like that is 2 fold .
first many people do n't mind spending a bit of their money to support the art form they enjoy .
second people are afraid to get into trouble '' either from downloading illegally or from getting caught and banned from a company like audible .
most people just accept that we live in a time where we trade our for entertainment .
i think it 's too much of a pain in the ass to constantly create new accounts just to save a few bucks and audible probably knows that people do this but for the most part people pay and they make their profit .
if too many people abuse this loophole of creating new accounts every month they 'll eventually shut it down but until it becomes unprofitable to ignore the issue they 'll ignore it .
if you are looking for free audio books there are plenty of free resources out there that may be just as easy to access as creating multiple accounts on audible .
youtube local libraries college libraries friends swapping and although i 'm not promoting it even piracy .
there are also legal sharing sites that you need an invite to get into but they 're a bit specific sometimes and are hard to get into if you do n't know members already or have a large library to dangle in front of them

i did a quick google search and it 2013 prius uses h11 bulbs .
the only issue i could see is i heard some people have led kits as a default in their cars and then switching from the led kit to a halogen or hid can be challenging .
very cool ... but it does n't say what the catalyst is or what it does to the liquid to release the energy .
i have a feeling that this is either going to be a vaporware or another tech locked behind patent for many years because of some ... whatever the excuses will be .
not the first time some tech get tossed around on the news and then never see the actual result .

i 'm currently in a type 7 doing exploration .
maybe i 'm doing it wrong i dunno but i 'm having fun .
i 've got it set up to do 25 ly jumps max which may not seem like much compared to more dedicated explorers but i 'm not ready for that trip to sag yet .
i do n't max jump anyway except to get to the general area i 'm going to explore .
once there i set up routes using economical settings and just roam around honking and scanning .
this weekend was a bust for elw 's but i 'm getting a ton of first time discoveries terraformables and water worlds .
i 've also done some surface level exploring in the srv .
my theory is that people are so hung up on the long distance jumps that they completely overlook the in between '' systems and that 's where i 'm raking in the discoveries .
systems that are 4-6 ly apart from one another etc .
the plan is to use the haul from this expedition to build my sag ship .

b2 w2 as well for me hgss has a long post game but the fact the it is just another map and not much difference in terms of gameplay which makes me feel like it is still part of the walkthrough not saying hgss is bad tho .
b2 w2 just have so many creative different things you can play with other than translational pokemon and dream world with pgl extended the game online to a further level we honestly need more pokemon main game like those .
the real problem is now im speculating management has them working on the next game right after they shove their garbage out the door .

not to rain on the parade really i 'm happy that astro got their 1st win but i think the scoring makes kinda less sense ?
for the week covered by scoring wjsn should have a better digital than astro based on melon daily chart while astro has gathered almost 4 time as many as views as wjsn .
but all my expectations are overturned with astro having perfect score on the 1st row and wjsn on the second i 'm expecting wjsn kinda leading the 1st category and astro way ahead on the 2nd category .
can someone clarify the scoring system for the show for me ?

nintendo exclusives are quite different from the metro situation .
nintendo develops its games itself and i find it fully acceptable if they decide to leverage it to make their platform more desirable .
i do n't think anyone is complaining that fortnite is n't on steam for example .
the metro deal is competition sure and it may be good for the market overall but it is at the expense of consumers which i find disturbing

if you fuck something up just to bring you back up to normal 6 rating in this instance you have to fix that problem .

once you lose a recording you 'll start actively working how to avoid it and most all of those solutions involve a dedicated recorder .
in fact that 's what drove me to a dedicated recorder .
now i use the recorder but always have a backup going too .
nearly add recorders have a line out that you can plug into the 3.5 mm input jack on your pc and record a single track audio backup .
as long as you have the ability to connect the microphone to the interface or recorder via xlr and have the xlr cords you should n't need much else .
perhaps some studio monitoring headphones and a headphone amplifier/splitter .
devices like the zooml-12 or the rode procaster have everything combined but then you are taking well into the 599 range .
but once you start pricing out all the gear that you 'll need the l-12 or the rodecaster pro are quite economical for what you get .

the issue here is that everyone knows it 's a great card .

its a complete lack of respect and i really think noone deserves it .
you should take time for yourself and really ask yourself if you will ever trust him again .

there is a big difference between frugality and being cheap .
i am frugal because i work hard for my money and do n't want to be foolish with it .

as already mentioned the ttk does n't affect snipers in any way .
also every single game that had ever had a sniper type class had always ended up with more people playing that than anything else .
everyone just wants to be the super cool lone wolf with all the headshots .
the reality is though that any teams with too many recon generally loses even on defense .
snipers are counted extremely easily whether it 's just sticking to cover or using smoke to cover their position or just constantly mowing down every glint with the tank mg. snipers are unable to hold back any half decent attack .

one option would be a 2018 mac mini with an external enclosure for your drives .
that 'd be a smooth transition and assuming you 're most comfortable with mac os x the simplest learning curve .
it 'd also be a major performance bump as the new mini is a beast ‚Äî and compared to your old mini it 's an enormous step forward in processing power .
you 're looking at about 1000 for the new mac since stepping up from the base model is highly recommended .
you can keep using the drobo for now or upgrade to a thunderbolt 3 enclosure .
on the other hand you could get a more basic box and run a linux or windows system for about half the price .
possibly you could even go for one with room to install your drives internally which would probably offer a performance advantage .
the former is simpler and means less time spent on configuration .

the economy is currently too large to be pegged to commodities .
even in ancapistan the money would n't likely be tied to anything .
it makes the currency more manageable and less prone to supply shocks and allows for more flexible use in borrowing .
there are many cases where commodity-backed money failed in history as well and it does n't always safeguard against inflation because of fractional reserve banking and the altering of peg rates

at first i thought it was a case of the few affected people screaming the loudest but i 'm starting to think it 's a real honest problem although i just saw a post about an op5 user getting great battery life on 9.0.3 .
i 'm thinking it has to do with having to basically write a new rom and kernel for the 835 soc and that it 's not optimized yet .
especially if a clean install of the pie update does n't do better .
generally though i can say that giving the phone a few days to optimise adaptive battery and it 's inbuilt battery optimization and doing your part as a user to conserve battery such as using a black theme limiting screen brightness being mindful of using battery hungry apps such as games messenger chrome fb etc .
also signal strength is a big battery enemy so low reception areas will significantly hurt your battery .
to that end turning off wifi and bluetooth when you do n't use them helps a little but the big thing is always cellular reception .
just do n't know if i could pull it off .

my now fiancee got me some art stuff for a project i was working on and someone said that my style looked a bit like hellboy creator mike mignola 's work .
i got my hands on everything he drew and wrote and then found a set of paintings that he had done that really piqued my interest .
from there it was as simple as trying to emulate how he did things then eventually working that into more of my own style .
my first paintings were rough in comparison to what i 'm doing now .
i paint or draw almost everyday now and it serves as a really relaxing balance to my otherwise very corporate and stressful career choice .
by that same logic so is whining that conor 'bullied ' khabib before their fight .

if the characters behaved like normal people the movie would have been 20 minutes long .
only if you believe your best years are over .
the problems wont go away and the shitshow wont end because you smoke .
make some te and sit down with some good music you love .
take a walk in a direction you havnt and dont think where you are going .
the resolution should be to do something nice for you that you know helps you relax .
not take some shit that not just clouds the stress but also adds to it .
the purpose of life is not to persevere through hardship .
it is to find those real things that gives you a grounded and mindful life part of that is making choices that help you find it .
on mobile as-well just stop there 's nothing wrong with deleting posts but atleast own up to it
reddit is going the way of other forums if the level of bullying and fascist style control freakery by moderators on this sub is to be the new normal .
i had a queen song stuck in my head when i read your comment
there 's a pretty distinct difference between whether it 's sally or ronda saying they can kill you with their bare hands .
got small pores but i love getting the goo out .
why would pro play at a disadvantage like that ?
not sure where you eat but no that 's not as good as restaurants .
source did this for years now eat ramen at restaurants .
i once had a guy bite my nose so hard during sex that there was bruising on the tip of my nose for a week .
should have used a mage would have looked more legit .
if your friend needs to move you offer your help you do n't wait for him to ask right ?
it 's the reality though the citizens are n't responsible for the actions of a corrupt government .
there 's way better books and movies out there ... but these 2 always captivate me .
he is just tough on the outside but soft on the inside .
the protests are for the most part caused by unfair wealth distribution .
valid point maybe ben can clarify why this one warrants this coverage .
my point is that i want people to understand why vegans want other people to be vegans .
for a psa it 's awfully inaccurate and full of dogma .
from your username i guess it is job related .
also if i am not mistaken your company is dealing primarily with safety related projects .
in this case better to stay away from yocto since it is prone to build different binaries from the very same set of sources in two consequent runs .
also i guess you had no other choice but using yocto in this case consult this book embedded linux development using yocto projects second edition isbn 9781788470469
correct me if i 'm wrong but loptous salamander forseti and narga you mean naga ?
yudu ethnia mother earth father sky delphi and fale are beings that never actually see in their respective games and formortiis is a demon king .
so while it would be cool if they did somehow get added the only being that 's legitimately divinity that we see in the whole feverse is ashunera and her split personas
my suspicion is that 4.x is going to end with us getting incompletely souljacked leading to an encounter where we free everybody by completely expending all 6 of our crystals of light one for each person counting ourselves .
this is where the ... '' receptiveness '' to darkness will come from as temulun of the mol said she sensed some hint of darkness in our soul even among the abundance of light .
i will say though i 'm skeptical of us going full darkness or anything like that .
and i do n't believe for a second that we 'll ever align with zodiark or elidibus elidibus checks off every box so far for final fantasy villains that are getting used by a greater evil power think golbez to zemus exdeath to angry magic tree demons pretty much every antagonist in ff8 to ultimecia kuja to garland back to kuja to necron sin to yu yevon etc. .
my guess for the end of the story is that elidibus will probably succeed in resurrecting zodiark then immediately discover that zodiark is in fact a jerk that 's just been using him and probably kills him for his trouble .
and then we have to clean up the mess .
ultimately i think what 's going on is that as shown by various encounters attempting to beat the wol in an aether and willpower contest is functionally impossible .
we 're a hilariously massive battery of aether and we can channel what seems to be an unlimited amount of it .
in the fight against the wod you saw this in action where we channeled aether to alisaie and were immediately scolded that she could n't handle the raw power we were dumping so we had to back off for a bit before channeling aether to her two more times .
alphinaud and urianger each took a single turn between our runs and they were completely burned out by it .
the wol 's capacity is ridiculous compared to other people .
so whoever is slurping up scion souls is trying to get the wol and causing a ton of collateral damage in the process .
trying to pull the boulder through the doorway and bulldozing everything else around it .
as for why krile is mostly unaffected talking to npcs reveals she got the headaches too ?
for one she has to remain unaffected because of eureka which is the it 's a game '' reason .
for two i think it 's a measure of proximity and closeness to the wol .
and that 's probably all the further they 'll expand on it .
99 of this is pulled out of thin air so grain of salt and all that .
my other assumption is that hydaelyn and zodiark do n't represent light and dark on a basic intrinsic level they 're merely the largest examples on one side or the other .
we know that they 're not omnipotent or omniscient as hydaelyn makes mistakes and does n't notice shit happening on a regular basis .
and we know that they 're not all that exists as far as such entities are concerned because midgardsormr and omega are both completely unrelated to them and from outer space .
it 's more mlp then fallout as much as the main character 's quest is stolen from fallout 3 .
look i stopped playing them at 2 because everything after that was shit .
but all the larger themes and the worldbuilding is tied up in first season my little pony friendship is magic .
it 's amazing work with the author doing a brilliant job of explaining all the little decisions and mistakes that led a world of colourful ponies who 's biggest issue was working out what friendship was into a apocalyptic war and what they all did afterwards .
first thing i tought watched my first na game this season after watching lec was here we go again .
the same old passive play from the na teams that wont get them anywhere .
for me the fun in na lcs is pretty much gone .
the teams should be way more proactive to achieve anything especialy at world stage .
c9 vs tl was my first game and i tought that was a passive stair down now my second game was the one with bang .
i will focus my attention on lec for now .
i dont see how you guys can even think thats remotely possible when there were posts here no more than 3 months ago talking about how the hunt 's and a few other owners were asking garber to remove 1 dp from every team and add more tam and gam to each team 's pool .
you look like a pretty normal karen to me .
i was thinking of blue velvet shrimp as i absolutely love the way they look .
was going to get 5 or so to start with and put them in a biorb flow tank like this https www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/b008ehrlgm/ref=mp_s_a_1_14 ? ie=utf8 qid=1548750922 sr=8-14 keywords=biorb+15l
you think doing 2 refreshes on bastilla fallen 3 cantina refreshes on ordo is panic farming ?
you should flunk out of this game while you still can dm has a much easier time cheating than a player no need for weighted dice .
and for the personal life part either do something about it or forget about it .
either is fine you do n't need to get involved in someone 's personal life .
but staying on the sidelines while remaining really passionate about the issue will only multiply the heartbreak .
i have friends in the bdsm community beenninvoted and went to a few kink parties where they do bdsm in front of people .
the people are interesting to talk to but i do n't think bdsm is for me .
i took it junior year through dual enrollment and it was your average biology class .
maybe a little more involved but nothing insane like it 's a 100 level class not 400 ahaha .
if you have a 's and b 's in high school you will do absolutely fine in it .
as far as learning before each class i just mean that for me there was a lot more reading assigned than i was used to and you basically learn everything before the class starts and then the teachers go over it again and like answer questions and stuff .
in comparison to high school where usually you go to class no clue what you 're gon na learn some cases and then you get homework that night on what you learned in class .
do n't get me wrong you still get homework but most of the time spent outside of class is studying reading for the next class ahead
a bit similar but i called my first girlfriend master '' in the bedroom .
way back then mistress felt weird to me and i was sorta trained to call my domme master '' from a previous experience .

i 'm pursuing an associates degree as well and there are a few certificates that i can obtain when i complete the required courses as i work towards my degree .
i can obtain these certs before completing the associate 's degree or i can wait after i complete my associate 's degree .
i would have to pay a fee for each cert once completed or pay a reduced fee for all certs completed .
before i started college i wanted to start out with certain certs .
but i decided i would just do the degree because all the certs that i wanted required completion of most of the courses working up towards a degree .
so i ended up starting classes towards a degree .
speak to an advisor and see if you can obtain the certs before your degree .
i had one more course to complete for a cert but have another year to complete my degree .
so i asked my advisor if i can get the cert before my degree and she replied with a yes .
but also advised me that depending on how many certs it would be best to collect all certs at the end to save money .
so check with an advisor do n't mention the strategy though because i 'm not sure if it 's considered cheating the system either .
just inquire '' if you can get your certs before the degree .
lol if so finish the last course get the cert and then let them know that you 'll be taking a break '' from school .
that fucking teddy pendergrass clip has me in tears every time i hear it .
hi american here and i do not think about your foods .

there 's no good reason for them to control the quantity of currency available .
i uncovered that unfortunately i am genetically related to these people and that my parents actually are my parents .
the sequence of events leading to this outcome can not simply be explained by the recent hot weather
sounds to me like incompetence has also played a role .
there 's obviously more to the story judging by this guy 's response .
my heart resonates ... hot enough to burn ... my blood is razor sharp !
i really hope this is a bug and not permanent
in the fourth movie i had to go out of the cinema for five minutes and when i came back every single allegiance in the movie had changed for no apparent reason .
i 'm convinced they just took plot cues from a five year old with action figures at that point .
i 'm a bit confused so it 's out of our control to choose what we 're attracted to ?
for me there 're certain mentalities personalities and physical attributes i 'm fond of that exist in the regions i 'm interested in more so than anywhere else .
stacked pop ups are just barely playable for me but stuff like atlantis scrims are just straight up unplayaple .
be aware that it still might not solve the issue but to me it looks like the culprit .
a good quality psu is always a good buy anyways .
good quality psu lines are evga g3 and g2 seasonic focus plus gold corsair txm and rmx bitfenix whisper m. even the corsair cx550m would be an upgrade .

if you are not in japan you can use a third party agent in japan to make the purchases for you .
just google shop on mercari japan and a few will come up .

dude i just saw an opportunity for a joke but did n't want to be a dick so i shared an advise i could n't care less if poster is a girl or guy the book is great and people need to check it out
for me it has the least interesting or catchy melodies of any of the killers albums and the overall sound and themes are too old-timey and safe compared to the modern exciting band i fell in love with .
over time though i 've come to realise it has some excellent songs and the ending of be still into battle born is their best ending to a record
yeah but he did n't get shot in the balls .
i really loved ftl and wanted to like this as well but it never really clicked for me .
my successes seemed much more dependent on luck rather than strategy .
i felt like ftl got the balance of risk vs reward better than this title .
finishing missions never gave me much satisfaction because i felt like i never was the one in the driver seat .
missions played out based on where enemies were randomly positioned rather than because i had made good choices .

he does it for money he 's a media figure he 's paid to generate clicks and interest .
he 's turned relatively minor news about wines hurting his shoulder into a big media storm with himself at the centre .
footy social media going absolutely boonta whenever he lobs up a mild hot take will keep him well provided with work .
i 'd laugh so hard if blade is in avengers endgame .
certainly no one would expect it just ups and goes to wakanada and fucks shit up
dont understand half the words you are saying and the rest i am not sure if true or an inside joke for australians and making fun of how gullible rest of the world is .
let me redirect you back to r/the_donald keep your toxic bullshit there .
i was shooting 120 shutter around 1/1000 and wide open at t1.5 .
there will be a couple of movies of the camelot singularity .
pleading guilty and being found guilty probably have the same outcome without a lawyer or public defender 's involvement .
it can absolute make a difference by negotiating a plea bargain .
would you rather get probation or 180 days in jail ?
i got some in a lot similar to this i took out the ones worth money and will use the ones not worth anything as face value

she might be annoyed that this has changed the dynamic of her social life .
there is nowhere near enough information to guess about whether she is correct about your future relationship with your bf .
you have a new data point in your life .
your friend tells you that you are not compatible with your bf .
it 's a bit vague and maybe you should press her for more information about what she specifically sees .
if you are sure she is wrong just dismiss it and move on .
by observant and see if you ca n't get more information to help you figure it out .
you make the best decisions you can based on what you know and who you are at any moment .
when you learn more you weigh it and see if you have to change any decisions .
well ... jeepster mcjeepface is by marvin from the unlimited offroad expo crew ... and its a bad ass build .

how is not seeing your enemy name or even your enemy when they paint it black and fight at night ?
thankfully they removed it in node wars but it 's still annoying as hell in rbf and ow .
but i am not sure anymore if it 's in volume one or in volume two .
there are some speech bubbles with a fucked up text..words are missing and they are not layered properly .
even the guy that got off for me to get on .
love it when white people assume your an illegal just because you do n't speak english and look like you come from south of the border
i think it 's going away for e-7 too but do n't quote me .
did n't affect me so i may have zoned out .
their review process is inconsistent and they accept plenty of apps like that .
i do n't own any baggy pants that fit over it and i am currently broke but i 'll try to see if i can find some cheap ones .
also i 'm worried that because i live in a densely populated city if people do n't see the leg brace i am more likely to be unapologetically pushed and shoved around forced to give up a seat on the buses etc increasing my chance of falling .
everyone says the graft is weakest between 3-6 months post op so i 'm more nervous than ever nowadays ...
i have n't seen anything like that except molecular acid ...
i genuinely feel that the more tools i use on terminal the more i 'm investing in tools that will be around longer than me .
there is no animation difference as you e. it 's a matter of 50/50 either you predict he will use q and stun him or you predict he 'll fake it and cast after you riposte nothing .
same goes for yasuo it 's just mindgame and straight up hoping that they predict wrong when you e+q a fiora
then they get on your way all day so you kill them all
even if you do n't want to pay for the scroll you can use the ectophial and walk like 20 steps to the boat .
robbery is defined as involving force or threat of force .
so while it is a form of stealing it would require interaction with someone to forcibly take their stuff or threaten to kill them for it etc .
to steal you could break into their house and just grab it while they are gone or asleep .
charleston sc although there 's already a show based in charleston it 's not a housewives franchise .
old money versus new money is a huge battle in charleston your family where you 've come from and who you know and what/where you attend is very important in the south .
they could pick from the old money people and then go and get some new money college of charleston graduates to fill in the rest of the cast .
charleston is one of the most quaint southern cities full of history and strife where there is a lot of backstabbing and bless your heart being thrown about as shade .
i 'm looking for the full outdoor partying/crowd/watching the game on a big screen so this seems like a close bet .
yeah i remember crying as a kid every time i watched it .
it had to be pre-k. a few months back i watched up to that point again .
i thought it was about breastfeeding but i totally agree .
not entirely sure heard simple and clean as a child and adored it .
heard sanctuary for the first time on ps4 as an adult and also loved it same emotional attachment as when i was a child .
face my fears is fine but i have no emotional attachment to it the way i did the other two songs despite being the same age as when i first heard sanctuary .
i 'm actually a pretty big skrillex fan too !
i 've just been trying to get into photography on the side .
i 've only done a couple weddings and a few other shoots .
enjoyed it all very much and trying to find time to do more practice more and get a bit more work !
last night i dreamt i was a 20-something woman with dark hair i 'm 57 light hair and for some reason i thought i would get healed from some disease-no idea what it was if i canoed down this huge river for several days .
the water was a mile or more wide very dark and it was smooth as glass .
i was very afraid no one could save me if something went wrong .
then sure enough the canoe capsized and i was right under it breathing in the air pocket .
the canoe was so heavy i did n't know if i could turn it over .
i was afraid to dip under into the water so that i could get to the outside ...
next thing i know i 'm in the upright canoe carrying on with my journey but now i 'm wet and freezing .
far away on shore but i 'm afraid to go to them .
next dream same night last night i 'm walking around downtown portland doing some kind of work thing when i realize the streets are just mud not pavement and the lovely silver evening shoes i was wearing ? ! ?
had gotten sucked off by the mud and i was walking around in nylons trying to act like it was no big deal .

step outside 'merica and most people eat bacon like this the normal way crispy bacon ruins any flavor and is horrible .
the poor bunny has been hiking for hours so he 's taking a breather before any more upward climbing .

i 'm talking about her complicity during her run as home secretary in covering up a historic paedophilia subculture that runs throughout parliament and many of this countries public institutions .
in this case 'the other side ' is exactly the problem .

i do sometimes wish that the fusion generator you can build just upchucked a fusion core every 20 mins or so .
there are perks to decrease score weight and ones to increase fcore duration but they 're all under intelligence which is already a pretty competitive special attribute if you do n't want your power armour and guns disintegrating .
i imagine the devs want us fighting over power plants to secure the core generators but what i 've instead seen happen is after an hour or so of a server being up someone 's done the rounds and picked clean every fusion power plant in the wastes leaving you pretty much farming heavy assault bots or finding random pa spawns for partially depleted cores .
i mean my character at the moment isnt too fr off i just need to spend an hour in pvp to get the levels
are you talking old expanded universe or new canon ?
i 'd recommend lost stars from canon covers the whole original trilogy and gives interesting perspectives on the events .
not a reading order i know just a recommendation !
this could be adapted to many things very nice !
it 's cumbersome to check resources on tiles assign citizens to tiles and in late game it takes ages to load up the city production menu .
but the graphics and music are superb i easily get hours out of the switch undocked and it 's addictive as ever .
competitions should carry more weight than rating websites for this comparison the english-language websites skew heavy to an american audience specifically american craft beer fans which means that american craft beers will be over-represented .
that being said as someone who 's worked in the alcohol industry for a dozen years and had beers from all over the world including some unicorns like utopias westvleteren xiii and pliny the american craft beer movement has produced some astoundingly interesting beers including examples of styles that are both envelope-pushing and absolutely jaw-droppingly good .
cant sound anymore interested in reviewing stuff we have basically no knowledge of yet .

they 're really trying to take every single cent of our red packet money .

not quite directly to them i 'll edit my post for clarity .

xd think this would 've have paired nicely with a e-m5iii as a super all-in-one .

then again turbotax is pretty simple to do as well but will also save your info so that next year you do n't have to fill some of it out again .
you could also just go with creditkarma 's free tax prep software .
if the 30 is n't worth paying and you 're capable of doing it by hand go for it .
but i do n't think you get anything useful in terms of knowledge or 'experience ' or whatever out of doing it by hand so i would n't do it by hand unless you 're just doing it to save money .

sympathize with victims but do n't just believe them .
believing sets a precedence of bias because we want to be right in what we believe in .
i always keep a neutral stance in these because neither side has been proven to be correct .
if there is evidence then he needs to be punished if there is n't then the accuser needs to face consequences if this is proven to come out as a false accusation .
provide support for the victim and evidence for the case but keep a neutral belief on the issue at hand .
public will just come out condemning before there is even any evidence like what we saw with the maga students who were found out to be innocent of the whole debacle that went on and even the guy who was a vietnam veteran '' lying about his service .
however other things point to them harassing women which is another issue unrelated it seems .

i have a two-shot western revolver that is quite underpowered and is only going to be much worse now thanks to this nerf .
the nerf should 've been that the combination resulting in tse just simply did n't drop .
what about the picture where tobey is smirking down at the camera ?
there was a meme about it that was like what my penis sees when i look at it
talk to your parents in the spring and tell them you would like to stay for the summer for list of reasons that do not include your boyfriend .
talk about getting a job to afford it and the probability that you will need to share a place .
also talk about the possibility that it would be your boyfriend that you stay with and see what their response is .
if they use your college funding as leverage talk to them about acceptable alternatives that would leave you in your college town .
ultimately it is their prerogative whether to continue funding your education under the circumstances .
i bought one from amazon that was doa and had to return it .
ugh i ca n't find which video it was i believe the 8 bit guy '' .
he basically prints the logo on clear sticker and places it over a metallic sticker and it looks spot on .
aside from the ebay route or asking here/geekhack i would attempt the above .
lol it 's getting really annoying i hope the developers sort it out soon .
i would n't say the exact opposite he 's publicly supported the lgbt community before with his wife and supported players kneeling .
he keeps his politics as safe guarded as possible really outside of the maga hat of course but he 's never exactly came out and said yeah i endorse trump 's politics and his message he 's usually like yeah we 're friends i 've known him for a while and golfed so it 's great
i was sweating bullets at the very end lol üòÖ
someday i 'd like to rent a bike and visit those spots .
do people respect sharing the roads with bikers there ?
for the record i was a first year resident doctor and he was the surgeon who was the 'supervisor ' .
he apologised to me about the situation when he came in to operate .
a nice guy never needs to say he 's a nice guy .
stories in echo park not sfv but it 's a cute lil place with a cafe that 's worth mentioning
it 's very common in young people i have it as well and it basically means you have the tendency to pass out when going for a relaxed state to a more active state .
i should add i was just on steam yesterday and i do n't remember any updates queued
im not sure but i believe it comes out soonish i 'll give google a look see if i can find it for you
everyone says the old days when i played were the best days . ''
but i 'm willing to contend that invasion/odyssey blocks were the funnest if not greatest standard ever .
that 's not the same market than the one that cash for clunkers fucked up .
we do n't see the negative externalities from that yet .
c4c destroyed the 500 beater market entirely and skyrocketed the prices of all the other 20 year old cars that were left .
that affects a completely different segment of the population .
the cars we 're missing from the used market now would be barely 10 years old which is why so many cars made in the last 10 years started holding their value really well .
i 'm so sorry you 're in this tough place !
i 'm going to go out on a limb though and say there 's absolutely nothing wrong with feeling great when you 're going out of your way to live a healthy lifestyle and feeling kinda shitty when you 're not !
aside from the therapy route which i 'd also recommend id tell you to find something to do with your body fitness wise .
mindful eating and going to the gym is great but athletic activities provide you with a goal is n't a number on the scale or a total caloric intake it 's accomplishing something fun and challenging !
hiking swimming rock climbing biking dancing tennis cross country or downhill skiing kickboxing jiu jitsu you name it .
and i know if you 're like me you see these words and picture a patagonia model chick with messy hair wearing wool socks and like effortlessly lifting her entire body weight with her arms and laughing drinking beer with all her smokeshow dude friends sitting in the back of her 70s land cruiser that 's like perfectly curated with 4 seasons ' worth of gear and accoutrements that she ‚Äòjust i do n't know collected over the years you know ? '
and she has an arrow tattooed somewhere on her perfect taut skin .
and then you imagine trying to do the same things she does and want to die .
but take it from me when you start thinking in terms of achieving physical goals your focus widens and you can kinda stop obsessing about the minutiae of your body .
por ejemplo ‚Äòman need to do some serious squats the next two weeks to get ready for this backcountry ski course so they do n't leave my ass behind ' or ‚Äòokay i should probably start jogging for like 20 minutes a couple mornings a week once the snow melts so when my boyfriend drags me out to go mountain biking i can make it up one hill before having to stop for a breather ' .
you become invested in the things you can accomplish with your body .
your body is no longer your project that needs work it 's your sidekick !
you are clearly a strong and determined person to have been able to accomplish what you had in 3 years time to turn that amazing will and dedication to something outside yourself and let your body help you get there .
there 's a ton of cheap z270 boards on the market right now .
he was doing well and then got overconfident and lost his arm because he let himself get distracted .
if he assumed that every fight was desperate he 'd probably do better .
that 's bullshit man pissed me off just watching lol..
there were a few months there i think septemberish to around beginning december where taylor was a bit too pushy and aggressive and just came across like he was trying to dominate the conversation .
it was junior year of high-school and i was 16 at the time .
no job self-inflicting homophobia i live in a conservative state and few suicidal thoughts .
one day in my advanced placement us history class apush i heard a familiar topic of video games from a few colleagues .
this colleagues turned into friends and we 've strengthened our friendship .
i came out to them they were cool and accepted me for who i am .
you can say that i got more social distracted myself from suicidal thoughts by hanging out with my friends more and more .
after that i got more social went to homecoming and prom for the first time in my senior year and made it out of high school .
friends are really people i keep a tight grip on metaphorically .
this reminds me of an incident on the subway in philadelphia pa when a man fell off the broad street line subway platform and several people pulled out their smart phones to record the incident .
i figured these articles were going around because did n't netflix just increase their subscription price ?
they need to find a way for us to justify the added expense .
i knew that you made it sound like they would make more catalysts just by being around .
it 's assumed to be real as it 's perceived to be reality .
the perception of this reality is real but that does n't mean it is real outside of my perception .
if others perceive my same perception brought about by use of psychedelics there 's no way of knowing if our mind created that or if that exists outside of us .
once you die the combat/turn is ended so you just kill yourself once
so this is the third mechagodzilla design with the original being from 74 and the second from 93 .
the original is super atomic age looking and is bristling with laser guns !
the one in 93 combines with a jet to become super mechagodzilla and has thicc thighs .
this one is code named kiryu and was actually built on top of the skeleton of a former godzilla .
there 's one last depiction of mechagodzilla in the crummy new netflix anime that looks like a bay transformer vored a pile of shrapnel .
i 'm just now starting to dabble with logic .
coming from anaheim i 'm already used to those numbers !
yeah i used it to move my prawn suit yo the trench and basically havent used it since
you know the sad thing is they probably could have pulled it off if they gave themselves time to work on the festival and they would have made a killing .
this https i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/207/brainlettttt.jpg is probably u/michaelv27 once he heard classes were cancelled .
ngl i thought ginuwine was some fictional character for the show
that 's fiber mascara very carefully applied to my peach fuzz which i 've been using beard balm on lately to make the fuzz fuller and longer .
i 've been working on the technique for a while .
i also have a more masculine frame and facial structure than a lot of afab people .
edit though i 'm still only 5'4 so built like a tiny man lol .
with the decreased release cycles what will pixonic team be spending their time on ?
looks like a point that has been bit by the plow a bunch .
clearly there are chunks taken out of the top and bottom blade edges leaving just the base and tip intact .
we have a good stable of rbs and an alabama qb built like a fb .
looking at their last 5 each home/away respectively this bet seems like a no brainier .
we all know what you wish she was sucking you perv .
river and boca are most certainly not selling clubs .
they are the biggest teams in argentina and can pay way more than the average argentinian team .
hence why boca just turned down a 24m offer for nandez .
they are also considered to have the best academies in argentina .
had atlanta paid pity 's release clause river would 've only received 70 of that 10m because that 's what they owned .
they settled for 13m of which 10m corresponds to river .
however river will also receive another 1.5 if pity starts 10 games for atlanta because of a clause in the contract .
not stupid at all.. genius i would say.. job well done !
i mean if u give me another 1tb hard drive i 'd just put it in my pc fill it up with more games and what not but that 's all
is this the place that had the creme filled donut holes if not does anyone know where to get them
i have a lever action with instigating as the legendary effect .
it does good work at range i am a melee build so i have no perks helping it .
and i can one shot low/mid level enemies and normally kill higher levels in 3/4 shots .
you do n't need too many wincons replace excess wincons with tutors and you 'll be good to go .
i personally do n't run any propaganda effects but i also do n't play 1v1s and my general philosophy is that i 'm not really scared of creatures attacking .
pushing out a quick estrid with dorks can let you get her to her ultimate before people really have good attacks on her .
so run follower voyaging satyr and arbor elf for sure and consider some of the other 1drop mana dorks as well as vizier of tumbling sands .
also consider additional land enchants like weirding wood verdant haven new horizons etc .
bring to light is a good tutor to consider grasp of fate is an upgrade to oblivion ring i generally like lay claim over the other control change effects because cycling works great in the deck mystic remora is super efficient draw etc .
in general just cut down on your topend and test out more efficient cards and try the mana dorks and you 'll be fine .
remember that if you enchant your dorks with an aura they 'll untap with an estrid plus .
that one that wilson threw to ... . oh never mind .
ran a 5k race in a forest had a pushing match with someone in the final 100m .
islam is both a religion and a political ideology .
any question that takes the form of are trump supporters/republicans really fucking stupid enough to blank '' can be answered with an unqualified yes .
for my customers i 've found 60,000 and less but it depends entirely on the quality of living you want .
i know eternal instant is not coming back since it looks like have n't come back for crafting in any other serves but ... eternal instant t.t
hopes are on a good recharge tune at dawn/clairs wish or fluffy gentleman/dream travel finally coming back as craft .
edit i 'm dying for a new dawn front event ! ! ! ! ! !
when are school planners going to learn that open area classrooms are never a good idea .
the constant noise disruptions from neighbour classes interferes with learning when you need quiet time .
the same is always said from open office spaces .
i dont know how passed out i had to be not to be woken up and how careful you had to be not to wake me up in order for it actually happen as you describe .
sounds like a good experience yet rare not that easy to execute and possibly little awkward .
if you want an anti-hero to take on the street gangs watch the punisher .
otherwise stop dreaming because you will only get disappointed .
i 'm hoping we get lucky and keep one .
the goal was n't to soundproof the room nor block sound .
the point is to reduce vibrations and sound coming from the washers and depositing in the wall .
but this is warface ... pings are still 1 bar regardless of you being in the region or not
i want to hear the sweet girl 's giggles upon the good boy giving in to her wishes ! ! !
it can be tough since there are n't many records online .
but records are around it just requires a lot of time and legwork since many are at archives libraries and historical societies or in obscure publications that you ca n't get your hands on .
i took a peek at your post re the cummings and metcalf family and i think we are half 5th-6th cousins .
my 5th ggm was charity metcalf who i believe is a half-sister to your abigail .
she is one that i have been trying to figure out for over a decade .
all i know is that she married a man named holton i still have n't been able to find out his identity .
for years i did n't even have a last name for her until the quaker records became available on ancestry .
i still am not 100 positive that she is the charity metcalf born 14 nov 1792 to thomas curtis metcalf and phoebe sidwell but her age matches from census records she was a quaker though removed for marrying outside of the society and i recently found another descendant of thomas and phebe whose dna shared percentage matches up to a 6th cousin as it should .
but it goes to show how difficult this time period is for research i feel your pain .
i have n't had the time to visit all of the record stores that would be necessary to get the answers .
it does n't help that the families jumped around cecil lancaster and chester counties either .
she enjoys cbb a lot more than regular bb it 's very clear .
no u dont understand the skill it takes to hit the remove button
and is there any reason the estate tax could n't be marginal like the income tax is or like the estate tax is for people 's in the under 20 bracket ?
i believe there 's a setting to keep it the old version without having to put the old .
! you 're right space x is a great company to watch whether it be tests or actual flight .
ca n't wait for my starship hopper flight videos .
that crew and a couple of heavies make for a packed year .
yes a year is a big deal at this age and that sounds like a really fun book .
at at least 30-60 minutes a day it wo n't take long to read a lot of these books .
perhaps his soul was stripped from him by gwyn a la odin in the first thor movie .
if you go into your youtube history and delete the video it should save your recommendations 3
i found nowhere now here sorrow parting far and further and meet us where the night ends really good .
parting and funeral song really sent me into an emotional realm .
when i first heard to the album i really liked it that there was one song that was pretty sombre at the start and it built up not too hard or brashy at the end .
it was a perfect song to listen to while hitting the bed .
the drumming on meet us where the night ends was amazing .
i really loved the fact that the overall decibels were higher than their older ones .
i am due to watch them play live on march 7th and i ca n't wait to hear the loud ass drumming .
i personally feel the loud play will really suit pure as snow and the last minute will be an absolute banger .
prior to this i 'd really connected with hymn to the immortal wind so it 's really difficult for me to consider it up there .
i 'd like one if they are still available !
i think its from toy story but i dont know which one
well spurs ucl spot wo n't be much longer so that 's fine .
i 've always valued the fa cup it 's a trophy and considering spurs record i reckon they 'd lose their shit if they won one .
it 's funny that in one of their best recent seasons they get knocked out but a season which conte gets sacked he wins one on the back of a poor season .
poch needs to stop being so entitled about not spending money it 's not getting him anywhere unless he 's happy with a good effort .
no rain at the moment clear blue skies bit of frost still on the grass .
true lmao if i end up getting a child somehow then i 'm going to remember this technique lol
funny 'cause it 's actually the games i play .
i did n't say i dont take pleasure grinding all day .
but a work about travelling in space or slashing every demons of hell is a job i can appreciate
i have spent the last week in relative isolation and i feel fine .
not even the soviet union did not exist back then .
when mw2r first started to be rumoured part of me thought they might make it an add on for mwr and that might solve that issue but now i think they 'll just kinda look at it like if they all sell as separate games and if they all sell well if enough which they could split player bases wo n't even matter as long as people are playing one of thier games they probably do n't care .
but litigation in this space is pretty new and i 'm not sure what to expect .

i do n't have data on the incentive behind conversion .
it 's sad that we indians fail to realise how bad the situation is .
your technically right as the source shows but de facto it will be considered antisocial on most streets which allows the filth to confiscate it that 's purely my experience though it may depend on the area of the country and the perception of the person
i was n't implying that much either but the fact that blood of younger individuals can have an impact on tissue it interacts with makes me believe that a transplant will not just age as the donor .
i always feel rollercoastered when i have to write one since i usually sleep from 4 to 11 .
no wonder i always finish last and need an energy drink to each .
the media is too busy either fighting for or against israel and forgets all about our palestinian brothers .
oh we have similar kind of brothers '' here as well .
actually due to mercantilism it was mostly imported from canada i do n't think you understand how big cargo ships are and how relatively little comes through the channel
she makes a nice noise and ticks a few boxes by being around but at the end of the day does fuck all .
i 'd give her 5 more years before the leaves politics due to ‚Äòdisillusionment '
thanks for the offer ill take it up if i dont understand anything
beto should run as a republican his plan to guarantee profits for the health insurance industry fits right in with them .
the first one is just one dude being a weirdo for randomly orgasming during a meeting .
yours tho ... just the imagination is so hilarious .
i mean both ryders are approximately 22 so they are pretty young .
personally i think male ryder tom taylorson is better for the more serious stuff though he 's still fantastic at cracking wise while female ryder does better with the sarcasm and snark at least as far as i 've seen in my 3 playthroughs .
dude how many threads do you need to create ?
did you do what u suggested in the last post you made and watch a pop installation youtube video ?
i think they summon themselves and within their group convince themselves that it looks attractive and that the boys will love it .
i never met a dude yet that actually found it attractive .
my kids will look back at '18 and look at the eyebrow trend the same way as i look at the 80 's clothes style trend .
any more information on the draft pick weights update ?
some of the missions are ok but others are gone
the main part is those trends are about global averages not just someone 's local weather .
selene wore a long flowing dress as to cover her scale-coloured and textured legs this hardly would help however since she had wings folded against her back children and curious adults asked her what was on her back they are wings of course this is my costume for the festive do you like it ? ''
she answered people continuing with a question hiding that they were real she smelt baked goods nearby so she headed that way towards the smell she went inside of the cafe 'marina cafe ' that was so carefully named to appeal to the marines and ordered some warm chocolate brownies she attempted to wait patiently but soon lost patience so she went outside to look at the the board she had seen as she entered 'a bounty poster ?
that 'd be fun ' she thought to herself as she began to look through the bounties and other items posted it seemed as though any high bounties had been cleared out so nothing was really worth her time and then she spotted a notice that was posted up fuck knows how long ago but it seemed that it 'd get the person who wrote it into some deep shit
should bring own gun a gun will not be provided .
contact information go to the guy with the awesome moustache sitting outside the cafe across the street .
reward will be split 50/50 in favour of me . '
she read it and looked behind her seeing the man sitting there sipping his tea at the cafe behind her she ripped the notice down and paced over to him do you seriously not know how much shit you could 've dug yourself into by writing this ?
though i 've got to say that 'd be more fun than what i am doing now '' she explained at the man as he looked up to her and answered so are you in or did you rip off my notice for no reason ? ''
he said clearly not caring about the fact that he was on a marine fort miss !
your brownies have been finished for a while come back inside to collect it ! ''
a female baker shouted out of the building 'oh shit i got too focused again ' selene thought to herself give me a moment '' she explained to the strange man as she paced into the cafe .
i 'm so sorry '' selene said to the woman worried that she had wasted her time not a worry it 's your food going cold after all '' the woman said cheekily back to her selene nodded and left with warm brownies though they were perhaps not as warm as they would have been she takes a bite and begins wandering out onto the street looking around confused at what she was doing here i 'm back here you know '' the mustached man shouted back from just in front of the cafe at an outside set of tables and chairs suddenly she started coughing at the surprise she felt at how spacey she was being i 'm so sorry '' she mumbled back to him after taking another bite she wandered her way back to him and sat down with him so what were we talking about ?
ohhh right the notice '' she said as she looked down she had been using it to hold the brownies ... oh '' she exclaimed audibly knowing she had just fucked up i 'll take the job ahahah '' she accepted as she laughed awkwardly at her dumbass self .
i cook an elaborate dinner and then put his plate down first then mine then i go set up our projector so we can watch something while we eat .
by the time i 've found a good documentary to watch he 's done he 's had seconds and maybe even he 's noshing on a bowl of yogurt n granola .
meanwhile i 'll lucky if i finish my dinner by the time i have to go to bed .
hope you learned about asexual reproduction you are going to need it .
on second thoughts maybe it is better you do n't reproduce .

nebenbei gesagt fand ich pers√∂nlich den beitrag von game two eher schlecht .
that means you 've read the bible 3830747 times !
that 's almost half as many times an atheist has read it !
would n't that include everybody that chose the night 's watch over criminal punishment or was on the losing side of a war ?

this https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=cazuvz2f_dc is my current favourite song .
im just saying that you 'll rarely work on a brand new code base or product .
most of the time its just hacking away on a legacy code base trying to fix an existing bug or put in some new feature without breaking all the rest of the fragile shit around it .
all while dealing with bullshit agile scrum crap and the politics around it and the high probability youll be on a team that has no idea how to train new devs which will leave you fucked off all day every day .
then ill come home and code my own stuff and regain some sanity .
i was in switzerland in the fall and took every opportunity to make beautiful shapes in beautiful places .

it 's being handed a patch and stumbling over problems that frustrates me .
because i have no confidence that my voice will be heard there is n't even a bug report '' ticket i ca n't view discovering problems and changes as a bug hunt .

here are some rough prices for what i think are the best wheels in those colors that are also in you 're price range .
maybe look them up and make another post looking for them .
legendary only gives you a few skins that can be obtained without paying any money and getting them from progression lootboxes not worth it at all unless you really want skins at the start .
in an ideal world yes but most companies have them in some quantities and its not rare that they 're the majority usually in huge corporations .
i ask because i used to work at a place those were the initials for so i ca n't think of it ?
they kept buying expensive pens so i 'd take them and tape them underneath their desk or in other hard to find areas so they were forced to use the cheap but reliable 25c pems everybody else had to .
look them in the eyes and let them know you mean business even if you do n't .
i doubt money motivates him though when is he even going to spend them ?
if they just fixed the damage done in relation to how close you are to the rocket then it would be fine .
i 've never really seen why everybody hates it so much as it 's not too hard to counter just protect yourself a little more and anticipate his shots i 've always either got them to kill themselves or put up build in time to negate their rocket then did damage with a shotty edit while they are vulnerable such as them reloading or building .
enough aggressive action can keep them from reloading/cause them to slip up .
i mean i see why most people hate the thing and even tho it does n't personally bother me i do agree that the problem with it is the damage radius but unlike op i do n't think vaulting it is the correct way to go about this
which means op knows he has a direct influence on making 35 people unhappy .
not into the other stuff being done to my butt .
someone told me if you lick it off then you get alzheimers because of the aluminium in the lid .
when we walked in one was laying on his side lazily trying to eat a chunk of fish which looked very funny the rest had either fallen asleep or were just laying around .
the whole enclosure smelt very strongly of weed for about 15 minutes after .

there is trash and ciggarettes everywhere..not to mention the tour guides who walk you through it in 6min .

it 's why they are capable of what they are .
the only thing they care about is material wealth .
if you want to stop this from happening you need to prevent corruption from resulting in net gain of material wealth .
however as evidenced by the fact we 're having this conversation westminster is corrupt as fuck .
there 's one where hg wells uses a time machine to stop him ?
because it 's like shakespeare but with lots more punching .
it 's like goethe but with lots more crushing .

the fuel evaporates long before it reaches the ground but i get your point .
i 'm arguing that the results of his actions are n't large im arguing that the actions themselves are n't all that large .
like let 's say it was instead another relatively small action leading to the plane being turned around .
maybe it s a medical condition maybe or w/e the point being that it 's not a big deal in isolation .
however because they turn the plane around and all that other stuff happens theres the big fines and all .
i understand facing repercussions for one 's actions however are the repercussions for relapsing while being a depressed recovering alcoholic really being fined 20k and barred from being able to travel to visit your mother ?

oh yeah obviously there must be a difference in the default settings that justifies this different result i never wanted to say that you ca n't use free software to have good prints i love cura and i 'll continue using it i just wanted to share my own personal experience and also point out the importance that the slicer can have on the end result independently on which one you use
i do n't really plan anything while doing that .
it 's more of a philosophical than an organizational time .
at the time they were releasing one new card every two weeks a system which had been done since late 2016 .
as the months went on more and more card releases had bugs culminating in the disaster that was the executioner .
march 2017 saw the beginning of the 1 card a month release schedule .
all things considered i prefer the new card releases to be slow like they are now .
not only do we not end up with as many bugs as we did before it leaves more time for the meta to adjust without the constant flow of new cards coming out to distrupt it as much .
first job after university i started at a pr company .
the main office in the capital city and one small one in my city .
then myself and my coworker was made redundant arguably we were the ones trying to change the company for the better implementing good social media structure training and health and safety policies .
once we left my manager who was amazing and a lovely person decided she had had enough of working for the head of the company who did n't have a clue .
she resigned and the whole office resigned with her .
the boss had taken the company to a point but was not qualified to grow any bigger and flapped around not listening to anybody .
i saw this as soon as i met her and i wish i had just left there and then .
du traust dich was so eine meinung in diesem sub zu haben
i move my head really fast and it causes a crack noise .
i enjoy it and i do n't know why .
cards on release are n't able to be collected for war .
they wait until most people have it levelled up so the rarer the card the longer the wait .
for example ram rider came out late last year and as far as i 'm aware still is n't available in war collections and wo n't be for a little while longer i would think .
wall breakers being an epic card would mean that they wo n't yet be available in war for a considerable length of time following their release .
i like how that 's where you took issue instead of the 51st state thing .
not unless you want your brain to shrink from the neuroleptic .
i do n't want to see aew fail but there is a portion of the fan base that is pretentious as hell and they better be careful because that kind of attitude is going to turn people off the product .
and that 's without even factoring in how much easier building is
if it had been lotr then definitely i would be single .
if you have transversives try reloading with them when you have 4 fan stacks .
then there 's zero bloom from the get go it can be useful
colby literally got the title shot by being racist and calling usman boring
yeah slapping maia around and ending rda 's streak meant nothing .
now usman has a much better streak than colby is seen as a more exciting fighter to dana and the racist/triggered memes are not funny anymore so he 's out .
what it really boils down to is that colby got surgery so he could n't do a two month turn around to fight woodley so the ufc got pissy and told him he 'd lost his spot in line and now he 'd have to fight usman .
he turned down that fight for whatever reason so they passed him over .
colby is a case of the ufc being petty because they told a guy to jump and he did n't ask how high .
it is common nowpledge that sean has the best bars in the game since biggie .
my levi 's sherpa has this issue on the right collar does my nut in !
test and prolactin are a bit low both of which i 'm rectifying now .
without knowing my e2 yet i 'm thinking the correct course of action right now is drop to a cruise up my test dose minimally to get in range and then wait for e2 to come back and see how much further i can bump the test up .

he was viable without it i guess that 's why people are downvoting you .
he was the best tank killer really good against anything at close range .
his main weaknesses were ammo dependency long range fighting and uber medics he can airblast them but not kill them .
all of those weaknesses are gone with the gas passer .
no class but pyro are without any weaknesses now .
thanks for letting us know that you have n't gotten drunk yet now i can be sure that it 's just the weed .
it 's embarrassing but this movie gave me the worst nightmares more than any other movie did .
those bugs that get in your skin especially the scene where the one goes through the mans body to his brain then he runs into the wall dead messed me up .
it took an entire month to not have a nightmare about those bugs .

i think it was confirmed a while ago that they follow each other ?
i think using social media as a way to figure this stuff out is kind of silly though .
and i think it was also confirmed that they became buddies around the time of the home run derby .
even watching that day you could tell they had fun with each other .
you got some of the eagles going around liking insta posts of dudes who are n't on the birds .
lol push on it kinda hard with your finger and it will bend .
it 's the same schematics just does n't power/function the same like it did a week or so ago
for 75 points you can have 3 pyrovores that help protect your backline guys from charges .
i think that is what they are best at .
they can punish charging models and even if they get chewed up in melee they could send back mortal wounds .

not yet heartscale should be my first book with dragon 's choice being the sequel but i 'm still months away from there .
all my chapters are only rough edited and not very well fleshed out .
i 'm waiting until i have the whole story written to do any hard editing .
but my goal is to publish at least heartscale before the end of the year self pubbed on amazon .
been off the sauce for about ten years now .
it was the best decision i made for my mental health .
you should n't be getting your political information from facebook anyways .
there is a whole internet out there for that kind of thing .

tbh i understand that the epic store does n't have nearly as many uses that steam does but i mean it ca n't be that bad right ?
can confirm spit does not freeze before hitting the ground at 54¬∞f .
i think there should just be a flat point rate for draws .
0 points for an hour and a half match feels bad .
my area just gives 1 point to everyone still alive when time runs out .
that phrasing is just a bit too suspicious to ignore you might have something interesting here .
he just changed his opinion to be the 550-750 figure because thats what dems folks said we would do as thats what we 've always wanted .
so they did n't pay so he should n't get a wall .
nit we will start a trade war and try to get them to pay that way .
his trade wars have n't had any success other than hurting our manufacturing plants .
i 'm reading david foster wallace 'broom of the system ' right now and a part of the story has to do with gerber baby food and where it is from so i 've stopped just now to fact check .
but honestly in this book i do n't care if its accurate or not .
i think it depends on how the issue your checking is being used in the story .
i mean the pacers won a lot of games without him too he was out for a lot of games this season .
they 're really deep not sure why they seem to have given up completely .
the greenery should n't be that vast.. especially at the north
a piece of wood that contains portions of dragons cuts of their hearts so it seems unlikely that dragons survive that use unicorns who are famously skittish to basically 99 of the population or phoenixes of which there are only two that are domesticated such that parts could be used fawkes and a mascot in new zealand .
the wood is perhaps not expensive in and of itself though magical treatment of it probably increases costs .
but it seems almost a certainty that that the core is expensive .
it must have taken a long time to eat the whole microwave .
well g 's old stuff was amazing like endless summer and the outsider basically anything from these things happen to before
the way the leg is designed on the ranger i can see a human leg fitting inside it .
your knee would be where the first joint is your foot would be right above the second joint and everything below that is essentially stilts .
the storm and particularly the interceptor have much longer thighs '' though and much shorter ankles '' or whatever they 'd be called to the point where i ca n't see how a person 's leg could bend inside it without breaking with every step .
ranger looks like it 's about 40 thigh '' 40 ankle '' and then 20 stilt .
the storm and interceptor look to me like they 're about 50 thigh '' 20 ankle '' and 30 stilt .
i 'll bring a book or listen to one on audible and try to stay in my happy place until i 'm safely back on land .
i do n't like flying but i like traveling more
so the main reason you 're upset is because you ca n't take the time off work to go and it bothers you that he 's having a good time with friends ?
they ca n't seem to separate confidence when it comes to talking to women and confidence in other areas of our life .
it 's only reasonable to not be confident at something you have repeatedly failed at .
buying a cover thingy would prevent needing to clean it much though
the children do not think it 's 2045 as they all do have calendars they can view that says 2045 as seen in episode 1 .
just an fyi as i think the anime did not clearly explain the 2015 thing !
i 'm so happy that it actually looks like the entire team cares about winning this game not just kemba

the silver age has the best covers in my opinion .
i forget where in england but its super common is this area .
basically its like a community that relies on government handouts and basically its not uncommon for there to be 32 yr old grandparents .
oh you mean like when trump bragged about sexually assaulting women and over a dozen women accused him of sexual assault and people like you defended him and elected him as president ?
welp i knew i clicked on this link for a reason
how do you write that sentence and see yourself as human
i 'll be an inter i just want to learn your ways i 'll work for free !
do n't have much to hang my put hat on these days .
simplified its why black holes glows since they bend spacetime so much .
maybe these craft bend spacetime so much that they create their own event horizon and thus hawking radiation .
wonder if bob lazar has given this a thought .
hawking radiation is blackbody radiation that is predicted to be released by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon .
it is named after the physicist stephen hawking who provided a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974 . ''
i would appeal and take pics of the spot to justify it .
yes it could still be the only solution for their expression control .
expression pedals are simply providing a resistance value to the pedal you 're using it to express .
literally every single expression pedal in the world looks this way .
i do n't know for sure and i 'm not gon na look into it but the pedal you bought it for might take a specific expression pedal wiring scheme only .
in that case it would be the only solution for the pedal you bought initially .
think an apple iphone charging cord vs every other usb charger on the planet .
before you get upset about it being proprietary or something who knows what kind of design went into that first pedal you bought and maybe a special expression was warranted .
we 're booked to do three capes track starting next thursday .
anyone have a wild guess if they think it will be ok ?
yes i know it cant be predicted but hoping the cooler conditions mean some of the fires can be controlled to some extent .
any chance you 'd go a bit lower on bakemonogatari since i 've bought a bunch from you on different occasions ?
it 's starting to become a habit that i just go to you across different paychecks haha .
i am using overdriventool to undervolt and overclock it 's a pretty heavy configuration i 'll admit but before 18.12.1 the issue did not happen for me at all .
almost every vega post in this sub has something to do with random black screens right now .
what about issues not discovered in utero as not everything can be tested ?
precautions have never had a 100 success rate anywhere .
you 're pro choice as am i. i just do n't see the difference between a foetus and a newborn that does n't even know what objects are for like a whole week .
a mature cat or dog has higher levels of cognizance .
why is it this so monstrous but is it perfectly ok in utero even when healthy or perfectly ok for animals who have reached a further stage of development at their times of death ?
i just do n't see it the former is healthier the latter more aware .
lost my account forever ago so its interesting starting from scratch and learning whats changed over time .

i have a tattoo covering a skin biopsy scar and another covering a self harm scar .
for both i checked with the artist beforehand to make sure it would able to be tattooed over both were completely healed light in color and flat so it was n't an issue .
the biopsy scar ended up raised a little bit but the other scar is about the same as before .
i had a kid in my late teens and i was stuck in this combo so hard .
why would you want a job when we have a nice home and you can stay home with your baby ?
not many people get that luxury ! next day all you do is sit on your ass just because you have a good family does n't mean you do n't need to go learn how to work and provide for yourself ! for years .
finally got a full 8-5 job when kid was 3 and i was an absolutely terrible awful disgusting parent for putting her in daycare .
i agree with you completely and that has been my experience .
the kind of people who quit after a few months are the types who refuse to change change the language they speak cultural norms .
i once heard about an american guy who refused to take his shoes off because i 'm american and in america we do n't take our shoes off '' ... yeh ... nedd less to say he was gone about 3 weeks later .

what in was 25 here is south dakota and my door is good
except it still clutters clan chat to the point that it 's unusable and it still means there are dozens of unaccepted trades laying around all the time .
sticking with the ranger even though the interceptor was fun its ultimate was n't as satisfying to me as firing a load of rockets .
i work at one of the mines by point of rocks always amazes me being able to see the milky way with the naked eye once you get away from the light pollution .

i like blueprints because i hate scrolling through miles of code
also i find it very visually pleasing when it 's well done
what is worse is all these posts shiting on the mab posts .
you are literally doing something worse than you are complaining about .
there 's actually been a development since my last comment .
if they concluded that he lied they 'd say so .
i 'm not saying it definitely happened as he said it did .
i 'm just not going to get ahead of the police who are investigating it .
are you spazzing out at some troll picture or does anyone have the issue this is from ?
i have an autistic cousin that has exactly the same diagnosis as your son and this gives me hope that one day my cousin will speak because he has n't spoken in 8 years since his birth basically .
from one griever to another i am very sorry for your loss .
i know exactly how i like things better than anyone else .
unless i 'm tired in which case it could be both undercooked and burned and id just cover it in sauce and go to town on it .
thank you for wording this better than i could .
it 's not surprising that the sticky regarding these theme events in ladyladyboners has only like 20 up votes .
they still have n't replied to this post or those that have questioned their well only black women for a month is so limiting '' post .
appreciate the effort but execution could be better especially listening to the poc who find issues with it .
sometimes the game just eats one and it disappears .
and to add to that it depends on the source of your net worth .

what do you know about what it 's supposed to be ?
i got a breakdown i just have doubt that the discount is being applied .
maybe the tic tacs are blimps then with some sort of exotic propulsion ?
im pretty sure the whole weapons of mass destruction '' could be categorized as one .

i like to think dina does n't like horror movies because her only experience with horror is watching i know who killed me since lindsay starred in it .
well if anyone knows the guy by the team name vienna haemmers tell him to hmu cause i 'm trying to get roy asap lol .
batherson-150-175k lafreniere-80-90k elvenes 50-60k that 's almost 300k for an 88 ovr .
in truth it only contains phytoestrogens which have no effect on humans .
and npc meme is n't offensive it 's just pathetic .
or possibly something that could have a lil effect on the surface to create oxygen exchange
if bill had his way he would make gostkowski the highest paid player in the league in free agency this off-season
adding on to other comments its more valuable if the card is meta relevant or iconic .
so if you have a borrelsword or 1st edition dark magician that are heavily cut you 'll get a better value out of it .
the barricade is almost always in my experience used by a campy little shit hiding in a room .
you know i feel stupid now cause i was just about to correct '' you i could have sworn they were motes of light but no i was wrong lol so ignore that
i 'm especially concerned by the effect on both the victims of the fire s and my monthly energy bill ...
the ones from this pic that i am looking forward to trying sometime are the pacha mama blood orange nasty and ice monster .
i actually have some of them in my cart online right now .
good point however i think every prisoner would want some time off their sentence !
bane could end up being an awesome wild card for the movie ends up finding some stashed away venom and stages a breakout or something
do i need to remove it or staple more on for the desired effect ?
i 'll bend over to pick it up for you üòâ
my grandma made me something similar except it 's kylo ren in the middle .
it 's pretty badass looking especially from someone who has n't even watched the prequels yet .
i 'm really surprised how many ppl liked the ben bat-ffleck here .
personally i 'm just waiting for the lego batman 2 movie .
china only buys about 16 billion dollars worth of products from canada .
there are any number of countries that purchase substantially more .
we 're quite dependent on chinese products not just for consumers but for manufacturing as well .
yes many businesses have gone to china route but remember the entire purpose of tpp was to provide alternatives and move away from china .
i ca n't even begin to calculate how painful that would be for us economically .
during the current trade dispute with the united states we have seen consumer prices go down and wages go up so i 'm going to guess not particularly .
it is not difficult to find some form of third world country who is desperate for jobs and offers inexpensive labor
do n't overestimate how important they would see 30 million rich customers when it comes to what they see as a question of national security/integrity .
i i have no doubt that they would easily survive without canada but in the long run a third world nation with inexpensive labor cost is much easier to replace then 30 million rich western customers .
within a few years they would be completely replaced and they could never hope to regain the customer base they lost in canada

is op currently committing fraud by removing his own upvote before investing ?
there 's a limit to how many times i find it interesting to watch someone 's outfit change real fast and that limit is some number lower than however many they ended up doing in the video i just stopped watching early .
not op but there 's just nothing like battlefield really .
for all the bugs and flaws they still deliver massive games on a scale like nothing else .
seeing planes bombing tanks as the building you 're hiding in for a moment starts to be blown to pieces is more exciting to me than anything offered by any other series .
v has its issues like they all do at launch but it still offers a refined and improved big shout out to no aim assist and less reliable spotting battlefield experience .
no it really is a requirement for 90 of all versions where they would be summoned legitimately .
the only exception is fate summoning system and mooncell which only exist in one timeline each or if you 're an einzbern and know how to hack the grail .
hacking it carries the danger of going the angra route and breaking it though .

gpu manufacturers amd nvidia sell their chips to hundreds of oems .
gpus are commodity hardware with a much much larger ecosystem and distribution channels than specialized single purpose hardware .
the control specialized hardware manufacturers have on their markets and the availability of this gear simply can not be compared to commodity hardware .
this applies to all markets where specialized hardware is used ie .
neither of the vendors you listed sell an ethash asic on the public market today .
as far as i know and i might be wrong innosilicon has never sold the a10 to small buyers .
this level of access is very different from gpus that anyone in any country can go and pick up in their local store to a relatively fixed price .

do n't think we will get resident evil 8 for a while since re3make might be made first due to the success of re2make
it gives prisoners a sense of worth and allows them to contribute to society .
no i just do n't care much for the taste of it is all .
mostly all it did was give zarya and zen some extra protection from poke damage .
in a teqm fight the impact is noticeable but not really one that 's going to swing the course of the fight .
on top of all the other brigitte needs it 's going to make a cumalitive difference but it 's not 'the big one ' or anything .
cocoa tastes a thousand times better than cocoa powder .
if you make it yourself you can alter the amount of cocoa and sugar and find a happy medium .
my mum used to give me some change to buy sweets after school every single day and baked cakes regularly .
i mean thanks for saving my teeth from the damage of the dreaded ovaltine mum but what about the giant slice of chocolate cake i just shoved in my mouth ?

school has been getting in the way of old eating habits .
what would restricting them from the kitchen and laundry do ?
i ca n't seem to find any shred of evidence that free play days for all is on xbox this weekend ?
then you just require that no one except you can enter your sexy room .
det eneste som er overraskende med denne saken er at det faktisk finnes folk som er overrasket over dette .
knowing your full of shit anyways fucking itt tech good luck paying off those loans what a joke .
i think my husband has a pair too lots of love from sexier than emilia clarke lol
it would be a nice change but seems really overpowered especially in the case of the steward and lord .
as they can be confirmed townies by revealing as mayor or claiming jailor .
also would the steward lose his executions for executing a non evil ?
because if not whats to stop them from executing three opposing faction members and gaining majority super fast ?
in my opinion they should make it standard conquest .
the way to tell if a guy is gay is he has a tongue .
straight people try to appropriate tongues because they are hetero trash but satan knows the truth .
there 's no reason to hate myself it does n't help me accomplish anything .

these are n't gold-farming alts and if you think so you are oblivious to an huge issue in the game .
the gold seller logged in and out atleast 10-15 times while i was woodcutting .
trading different people everytime he logged in never saw any of the people return again .
that 's why i always made sure to light up when i was somewhere 20ft from where anyone was .
it does n't matter if some people smell it on the air they hunt you down to lecture you or make a snide comment .
honestly most of the time it seemed like people were happy for the excuse to let out some frustration at a target they felt they had the moral highground over .
i can tell you this much it was n't a single one of those people who got me to quit .
for lunches just grab some pizza slices from the local delis/takeaway places .
we had one right near our hostel called pizza rustica near piazza del popolo it was fresh and delicious every time !
why would op post in norwegian when a majority of reddit and the internet ... and society speak english ? ?
yeah only in the end times and that was a deal made with kurt not with karl or another elector iirc .
prior to that he had no claim to the throne as he like to think he does .
you 've been commenting on my post tonight and i decided to check out what else you had to say about this .
and once again you have made my night although this time through somebody else .
the thoughts that i am faking it or that i do n't have suicidal attempts have been through my head constantly .
empathy really is the best thing anyone has to offer .
because anti-vaxers are almost synonymous with religious fundamentalist and faith healers whom the left despise and seal to destroy for reasons that have nothing to do with their denial of modern medicine .
having a scapegoat to blame on then just justifies their persecution in their own eyes .

you are absolutely amazing sweetieüòòüòòüòò ... quik question for ya is it ok to pm you ?
i just started my transition and just have some questions .
at this point it seems pretty clear their strategy for competitive play is esports .
that does n't mean they are just investing lots more money in things like arena and the mpl .
it means they are cutting back on things that do n't fit the esports strategy .
coverage at tabletop events judges for tabletop events all that stuff is getting cut back .
expect to see more and more announcements of this type with that money instead going to things like twitch personalities paid to stream arena .
edit and the morning after i posted this wotc announces that the first-ever million-dollar tournament will be 64 people about 20 of whom were selected for having a popular twitch stream rather than being the highest tier of competitive magic players .
https magic.wizards.com/en/articles/mythic-invitational just wanted to say called it '' .

oh no it 's all real ppl that play the game the ones you fucked over and caused them to lose their shit .
we met in high school we took the most lazy option of pe possible for walking for fitness .
we had to line up according to last name in rows of like 6-8 and our last names started with the same letter .
i thought he was hot so i wanted to get to know him we dated for a bit broke up for like 4.5 years and dated other people those relationships did n't work out .
he messaged me on ig randomly one night and i had n't heard from him in years so i responded out of curiosity and we started hanging out again here we are dating again and it 's been almost a year and it 's been the best year of life i 've experience so far guess in high school it was just the right person and wrong time funny how life works sometimes
you 've obviously had a very sheltered life if you have n't come across offensive shit like this especially from young idiots with no idea on life .
dude you 're on reddit where millions of people connect every day over every possible topic imaginable and you 've never even considered that students would use similar means to get ahead ?

i thought jesus christ is it really not allowed even to touch females now in a friendly way .

he gave his all and he tried but i never felt he had any sort of authority with the players .

i once had a seizure in the bathroom and it cracked .
that 's an impolite way of putting it but ... yes .
4gb minus some memory for the operating system is n't really enough to be running modern browsers on unless you have scrooge-like management of resources .
well not so much modern browsers but the modern web which gobbles memory like nobody 's business .
check out what 's happening with your memory i imagine you 're hitting swap a lot and if that 's happening you 've lost .
swap is 'emergency memory ' rather than 'cheap/extra memory ' .
8gb of swap really is n't going to help you if you have 8gb of swap in use yes your machine will be as slow as molasses .
i generally do n't go above 2gb myself since if you 're hitting swap you do n't want to hit too deep but if you want to hibernate your laptop swap needs to be as big as your ram .
throw in the age especially for the disks and yes performance will be less than ideal .

but this is exactly the point he 's making .
it could never happen here '' is absolutely false .
anything can happen anywhere if tensions mount too much .
you can only feel the difference in temperature and conductivity as well as the flowing of water .
i think the requirement was a height of 24 or 25 .
you have not declared the variable spaces and your code will not compile .
you create a loop that loops through the height and makes sure each line is printed .
then you have a loop that prints a number of spaces followed by another loop that prints a number of hashes .
this way for each line a number of spaces and hashes is printed .
you might want to check the conditions in these loops .
write on a piece of paper what happens in each loop for a small height e.g .
go through your code step by step does it do what it 's supposed to do ?
that is a very reasonable answer to a very stupid op .
i just never understood why it did n't happen .

a small high school in a corner of suruga bay it is home to nine teens led by second-year student chika takami driven by one seriously big dream to become the next generation of bright sparkling school idols !

if you can afford some coins i would invest some coins at start use few rods and get decent ml waste some cash to rush first levels .
like using steatlh ring on cyclops then gfb from 30-50 in spike or meriana etc .
the waste wont be too much and it will save you lot of time .
from there you can hunt looking for balance of exp/profit like mother scarab and when you need money farm inbue items .
will be slower than sd minos in ora but shouldnt cost you too much money this way .
probably with 250 coins is enough to boost ur start .
again if you have more to spend i will say is worth but up to you to decide untill what point you can waste
not every partnership will work just like in real life .
no real projects will be done in one year just like real life .
especially anything the magnitude of what the if is tackling wo n't come to fruition for years .
i 'm not saying it will be a success and i am not saying it will fail .
but to be disappointed after so little time has passed is simply unrealistic and you are just bringing negativity in your own life for no reason .

you know i recently used el primo again after a while .
i used to say i do n't get why people do this '' .
but after playing el primo i noticed i end up doing the same thing i am telling myself not to do as el primo .
i do n't know if it 's the instinct to grab the gems or what but when you 're used to getting gems you 'll try to secure it for your team .
however el primo has good attack and can take hits that you feel that urge to push for that extra hit '' then you realize finally that you 're on enemy territory and it 's too late .
perhaps share this link amongst your london friends who may think similarly ?

if it was heal all adjacent allies '' it obviously only heals those that are adjacent when you use it .
however in this case it 's shield adjacent allies ongoing until the end of the round '' .
the shield works like an aura and only gives shield while an ally is adjacent regardless of where you or they were when the ability was used so someone could move next to you and gain it when they were n't previously or someone who had it could move away and lose it .
the same applies to enhancement field which gives 1 attack to adjacent allies

i had this research paper in pdf which talked about how kingdom of kabul came to be known as afghanistan .
basically british are responsible for it it is one among numerous british misnomers .
some british erroneously used the term afghanistan for the entire kingdom of barakzais as its rulers were afghans pashtuns .
they even began to use the term in official correspondences .
later barakzai monarchs absorbed the idea from british and begin to use it for entirety of their kingdom .
the absurdity is pointed out by some 19th century british academics themselves .
it were also british who coined the term 'afghan turkestan ' for region between oxus and hindukush .
there was a proper khurasan much of which lies in iran and there was another loose term khurasan which was used for the region between river oxus and suleiman mountains .
a britisher traveled with a lohani caravan from multan to ghazni in 1836 .
when they crossed suleiman mountains the lohani afghans told him that they have entered into khurasan .
mirza ata a writer of shah shuja 's reign calls the present-day afghanistan khurasan .
at one place he writes it is no easy thing to invade or govern kingdom of khurasan '' .
for now i use the term 'afghanistani ' much to to the anger and annoyance of pashtuns of afghanistan for citizens of afghanistan .
but what i call afghanistan is not the same afghanistan on the map of the world these days which is a british misnomer .
i am a history guy you cant fool me with every pashtun is afghan but not every afghan is pashtun '' non-sense .
dont be arrogant pricks listen to your tajik and other non-pashtun countrymen .

for example lina is farming jungle medusa is farming jungle not as efficient as me but what to do the heroes are decent to farm and i won but i might lose because 21k at 40 mins is really pathetic .
and 1 match i tried slark i keep trying slark it never works unless i get a lane guess what i do n't get and then i thought ursa is an excellent guy to just kill people and make space .
after all these carries will get farm after i stomp .
i 'm also subbing out am and replacing him with lycan who is a good carry to pair with sniper and drow since they will farm exactly the same space as tb and i can push aggressive as lycan .
besides one has to learn ursa at some point .
so i saw some replay of one guy bsjeaning or something thought it was bsj but i was wrong he 's rank 76 anyhow so whatever eh
it 's a stomp but what about the items ?
after deploying my vue js app to heroku successfully when i navigate to the url it is not displaying the app but prompting me to input non existent login credentials in a basic browser authentication .
i 've heard others have had this issue but have not seen a way to resolve it .
what 's up guys i 'm on mobile so apologies in advance if the formatting is a little off !
i did n't actually know who to talk to about this and i 'll explain why so i thought to post here .
long story short i had a very messy fallout with my parents which ended up me being kicked out .
a lovely friend of mine we 'll call her r talked to her parents and they agreed to let me live in the attic room whilst i get on my feet .
at any one time the house can consist of her parents her little brother her and me .
it probably seems like nothing but some strange things have been happening in the 2 weeks i 've been here .
firstly i 've been having sleep paralysis most nights which is something i 've had before but never nightly .
usually it happens at like 5am like clockwork which is super weird .
secondly around two nights ago i jolted awake because i thought someone was whispering in my ear .
i scanned the room and by the window was a cloud of smoke which quickly disappeared .
i can also hear footsteps sometimes when no one else is in it 's genuinely freaky .
but the thing that actually made me write this post was around 2 hours ago .
i woke up pretty hungover from nye and went down to get coffee .
as i was coming back up the attic steps i was almost at my door when it slammed in front of me .
no windows open whatsoever and no flow of air that could 've made it slam that hard .
i 'm fully freaked out but i 'm not sure whether to bring it up to them in fear of looking like a loon !
i 'll probably message the girl who was renting this room before me and see if she noticed anything cause i shrugged the other things off but that slam actually scared me a bit .
we danced the night away at a nye party drank too much champagne fucked to our hearts delight and fell asleep in each other 's arms .
hey just wanted to see your guys opinion on this statistic put out by an italki study funded by italki .
i 'm not saying anything about italki 's services just curious about your thoughts on this .
the language studied in the study was spanish i 'm assuming this 19 hours semester may not be true for languages that take more time arabic chinese japanese for example .
but it does n't sound too off considering it 's 1-1 language lessons v. a class of many students .
edit here 's the study http blog.italki.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/italki2018finalreport.pdf i 'm taking about .

do you have any idea how i can get it out ?

i 've been seeing a large influx of posts/comments recently complaining that buying a home in nj is not realistic to the younger crowd .
the real problem is that a majority of people refuse to live within their means and are terrible with basic money management .
everyone wants to live in the top-tier towns but that 's just not realistic .
there are many affordable towns in nj that have great downtowns and school systems with homes for sale .

i 'm 29m and i 've been struggling to find women who i seem interested in .
sure there are people that i 've chatted with that seem really cool and interesting at first but then i start losing that interest and start thinking that they would n't be right for me .
plus i believe looks are somewhat important for physical attraction and that partially factors in to why i lose interest .
i guess my question is should i lower my standards to find someone ?
i do n't want to be alone forever but at the same time i do n't want to regret settling and wishing i had waited for something better .
but what do you think of these two games .
i love how quick this base is but have n't found a smooth upper .
i just got my first riven mod from the war within come to find out after completing the required challenge to uncover what gun it 's for it 's for the snipetron ! ! !
i ca n't even get this weapon from what i 've found so why is this even still in the game ! ! ? ?
i 'm now sitting here with a useless riven and i 'm trying to decide if i still even want to play this game anymore i get the drop rates wo n't always give me what i want but seriously ?
come on warframe give me a damn break man .
so i 've struggled with depression since i was a teenager in my twenties now and while i 've still barely managed to get a life started much more is required of me to keep going .
and recently some of the most important people are no longer there for me .
i have done my best to keep a circle of friends so that i do n't feel that lonely .
now i just feel like a distraction like whenever they feel bored they 'll tell me to play with them no matter what i 'm doing .
if i say i ca n't some start ghosting me quickly and others throw a fit and cuss me out .
i recently attempted to take my own life by hanging but i got scared and managed to get my feet planted and save myself .
i told a few of these supposed friends and then they were very eager to listen and talk to me .
when i started feeling better they went back to their old ways .
i might try again soon it just made me feel lonelier again when everything just went back to normal .
i do n't know where to look for new friends anymore and being alone makes me prone to self-harm and other dumb stuff .
i dunno what anyone here could do for me but i had to open up somewhere .
really odd and specific question but does anyone know where i can find vintage camera lenses around here ?
specifically i 'm looking for minolta or canon fd mount lenses .
i 'm going to the san jose flea market but am not sure if they 'll have any vintage lenses there .

i 'm starting the merciless series by danielle vega and i see that book 3 is a prequel so would it be better to read that last and do 1 2 4 3 ?
or does 4 have spoilers for 3 so it 'd be better to just do them in the order they were published 1 2 3 4 ?
telltale 's minecraft borderlands and a wolf among us .
if you do n't know me in the discord i 'm the one working on a rune factory jumpsheet since myself and some others would like to add that to our chains .
i 've made decent progress with it but i 'm lacking ideas for some items and perks that can be added to it .
i figured the best way to break my funk would be to ask the general populace what the best things i can add would be !
if you have any ideas to help me out please comment and let me know !
the link to what i have so far is below
so based on some recent fights i have had sig 99 black widow does not allow medusa to activate living strands .
i was recently hired at a dunkin ' donuts in nyc and i 've run into a couple issues .
you need training for the job unpaid before actually getting a schedule and paid .
the dunkin ' official training guide states 10 days of training and i 've done 12 so far .
my 12th day was 12/24/18 which was christmas eve .
the problem is that my manager wants me to train even more and keep in mind i 'm pretty fluent with 96 of the tasks and my performance is good and each day of training is at least 6 hours long and after the 5th day i pretty much got the flow of everything and was working just like everyone else .
the thing that really annoys me is that another coworker did 21 days of unpaid training mainly because he just came to america and was n't very good at learning the tasks already got his schedule when we got accepted to the job on the same day .
he worked 21 days and was off on only one week end and i could n't come for a week due to final exams his performance still is n't as fluent as mine since he frequently asks me questions about the pos register and other small things yet he already got his schedule a week ago .
i recently stopped going to training and told my manager that i knew how to do everything and could n't afford to train for free 6-7 hours a day doing the same tasks as my paid coworkers and working just as hard .
he has n't replied and when i asked for his supervisors number he told me you need more train and until you get clock in you should continue otherwise u will forget .
i 'm confused now and do n't know what to do to solve this problem of not being given a schedule and given the poor excuse that i need more training when my coworkers and i all agreed that i 'm more than prepared to start paid work .
i talked to the main supervisor and he has yet to confront my manager not sure if he 'll be on my side either .
i just know that i 'm never training at that dd unless it 's paid training .
does anyone know if this kind of unpaid training is even legal in nyc ?
what about with my coworker who did 21 days of free labor ?
training and actual work are the same thing training is just unpaid pretty much
what are your thoughts on the postponing of my schedule ?
would greatly appreciate new insights or advice of any kind .
i was listening to sirius 52 and a song came on that i forgot what it was called .
i checked on dogstar and it did not go that far back .
it was a trap or edm song that sounded like it had some djembe drums playing when the beat got heavy .
i ca n't seem to attach a pic in an established thread so ... ... ... .
here 's a pic of the big move money in the es that happened today .
it 's described in the thread with the pic of my computer .
my mom got cool sculpting this morning and she just had a seizure .
has there ever been a connection between the two ?
i do n't know how they could connect but just curious if it had happened before .
but supposedly vasovagal episodes can happen several hours after a procedure not just during or immediately after like the internet says and they can be accompanied with stiffness and jerky movements my moms body stiffened up armed jerked a bit eyes rolled to the side and jaw opened .
finally did the one thing she 's been wanting to do for a long time for herself and this happens .
i met my roommate tanya in september and really hit it off with her .
she is super sweet and we have n't had any problems .
i met her boyfriend darren at the same time and i like him for the most part too .
darren is often over at our place which is n't really a problem for me since tanya has her own room and when i see him in the common areas he is always kind and talks to me .
however when we all hang out they are very touchy-feely with each other .
i totally understand this is n't even pda since this is tanya 's home but i 'm not sure what else i should call it .
whether it 's the three of us hanging out or all of us in a larger group they tend to get very flirty .
it does n't bother me so much when we are in a group but when it is just the three of us i feel like a third wheel and kind of awkward .
for example we could be hanging out and they start play wrestling .
they tend play wrestle quite a lot for maybe a couple minutes at a time .
this is when i usually get my phone out and start scrolling until they 're finished .
there are other examples like kissing and just being overall intimate that also make me uncomfortable .
it 's not something that always bothered me and even writing it out sounds so silly but after a few months it just got old .
i 'm single but i do n't think i 'm jealous of their relationship .
tanya vents to me about darren every now and again and i am very very comfortable with being single .
i think a lot of it stems from just being generally annoyed and not getting to spend much girl time with tanya .
because darren is over so often they are always together .
she has trouble setting boundaries with him and as a result i 've only spent time with tanya apart from darren a handful of times .
is this something that 's even worth being brought up to her ?
should i just figure this one out on my own ?
i really have n't had any other problems with her as a friend and roommate so i 'm not sure if i 'm just being overly petty and need to just let it go .
tl dr roommate and her boyfriend are very touchy-feely with each other when we hang out .
i just skipped 2018 and came straight from 2017 to 2019 .
trainer has abit of an opinion of this filly .
drawn wide but it should n't be a worry as they start up the shoot so only half a turn to go around .
it 's the second fave and they are hoping she jumps out and sits outside the favourite naval fleet .
always a big ask 1st up but she has the speed .
just fyi received this email about a price increase for hakuhodo mostly squirrel hair but up to 40 price jump !
we would like to inform you that hakuhodo is planning to increase the price of certain items due to the recent increase in the prices of the raw materials .
since hakuhodo currently has some raw materials in stock for production the price increases will not begin until february 1 2019 .
most of our products will be affected by a price increase ranging from 10 to 40 .
items containing squirrel hair and long horse hair be the most significantly impacted .
please note when an item runs out the current price will become invalid and hakuhodo usa will not be able accept any further orders of the out-of-stock item .
since raw material procurement itself is difficult the dates on which we will resume sales of out-of-stock items are to be determined .
hakuhodo has tried to prevent a price increase for many years because we strive to provide the best quality products at a competitive price .
however the increase in the price of raw materials has become too much for the company thus we have no choice but to implement this upcoming price increase .

now call me a loon if you want to but from reading a lot of cases and looking at people 's reactions to people being arrested for having sex with minors people only seem to be disgusted by the perpetrators because of the legal side of it .
i feel like if there was no laws against this more people would n't give this a second look .
some people fantasize about having sex with their high school teachers but ca n't due to the legal repercussions .
who knows how many teachers are only kept at bay because of the law ?
i know i sound absolutely crazy but give this a thought .
it 's a headache since the newly constructed road going to the shops is not connected to the main road .
usually 'road update ' requests can be done via the google maps app .
unfortunately for dubai it says we can not fix map issues in this region yet '' .
is their a known workaround to solve this issue ?
some are saying to file a request on rta but this seems to be a strange solution .
i mean supposedly every year there is a sports festival with which two would still be ?
if so tell me your most anticipated fights from worst to best i would honestly be these 3-midoriya vs bakugou 3 2-todoroki vs midoriya 2 and finally the one i most expect not only because of the epic that would be but also because i have also seen from the darkness as two types of fans are taken to kill and this fight would be the rematch of todoroki vs bakugou 2 this fight from my point of view would have more weight in the arch since now todoroki would go seriously against bakugou and once for everyone could say who is stronger since currently with what they have improved they have not faced

it just seems to me every weirwood tree mentioned is sone varying degree of ancient .
i can not remember a reference to any weirwood saplings or even a regular tree sized one .
one would think an ancient weirwood would have some offspring surronding it .
or is every one a transplant/clone placed by the children and the first men ?

although the result i 'm getting is something along the lines of

hugh stands at around five foot nine or so as he is rather old in his late 50 's or early 60 's
he is dressed in a tweed suit that has been put on in a somewhat sloppy manner akin to the classic absent minded scientist '' style .
he wears a pair of spectacles on his face that have slid somewhat down his nose he also has a second pair hanging around his neck in case he loses his first .
in the breast pocket of his jacket he has several pens .
his hair is almost all white and he has certainly been balding he has also grown a bear similar to this https homehero-production.s3.amazonaws.com/article-assets/bald-senior-with-beard.jpg he is also wearing a paisley bow-tie
in his right hand he is carrying his magic sceptre the avalon will '' .
the lower two thirds is exquisitely carved dark wood the bottom of the sceptre having been carved into the shape of a dragons head similar to how vikings carve dragons with a yellow gem for its eye .
the upper third is made out of metal seemingly fused into the wooden portion the metal is twisted in a fancy spiral leading up to a roughly-hewn green crystal that is clamped in place with the metal .
in his left hand hugh is holding a large leather-bound tome with metal corners and such .
his research on monsters and magic and especially on the ascalon gate '' a crystal that can be used to summon the bbeg to earth
in terms of his pose i was wondering if it could be something that shows that he is both a powerful wizard but still also an absent minded old science teacher
my first post on reddit but i really needed to get this out .
my ex came to visit me in europe after not seeing each other for 9 months .
we agreed to take a break at the beginning of 2018 because of the long distance with me going europe for that year and her working in the states .
honestly i did n't think she would even visit me because she found love '' with another guy at her work while i was away .
but problems would arise with her new relationship and next thing you know we started talking again .
eventually things were good between us and she booked her flight to see me overseas for 30 days which much persuasion from her parents because they like me a lot .
we had an amazing time in europe we saw the eiffel tower traveled to scotland it was like dream .
my ex suffers from depression and anxiety which i am more than ok with .
at first i did n't know how to help her through her lows because it was all new to me but eventually we learned to work through it .
she would soon try to overdose on pills and cut herself which are things she do when shes feeling low when i was away at work .
it got so bad that i had to hide all the razors and pills in the apartment which in the 3 years we dated i have done before .
we worked through her low and everything was good again .
we went for a romantic walks went dancing at a great nightclub and had great time .
she started walking around in her sexy lingerie which drove me crazy and she knew it .
then she asked for a message and i was more than happy to give .
my ex has an amazing body even though her self esteem tells her otherwise .
i say this because in the heat of the moment i took a pic of my hand gripping her ass which i thought was harmless because we share naughty pics all the time .
i would put my phone down and we would start getting busy .
later that same night she would stand over my sleeping body with the lights on .
apparently she went through my phone and found that picture and freaked out saying that i violated her rights and degraded her .
i was shocked because i did n't know how to take that .
she threatened to leave europe early because she was so upset but i calmed her down .
we once again reconcile over the issue and we even had another intimate night .
her time in europe would eventually come to end so i dropped her off at the airport with tearful goodbyes .
she demanded that i come to her family 's for christmas and new years which is something we usually did on the holidays .
before she even made plans to come see me in europe another guy a different guy mind you .
not the one she was in a relationship at her work already paid for him and her to go on a ski trip right after her trip to europe .
at the time i was n't worried because apparently this guy was a friend of hers .
during her time at work while i was gone she was hooking up with a married guy the guy i mentioned she found love '' with .
this married guy had anger issues and we sometimes take it out on my ex physically .
well one day the other guy trip guy would eventually step in save her .
and if who 's ever reading this she 's known married guy for like a year and trip guy for like 5 months .
yes she was in contact with trip guy '' the entirety of her trip in europe .
a week after i dropped her off at the airport trip guy '' picked her up from the airport took her home to her parents where he would proceed to get under her family good grace 's and ask her to be his gf which she agreed because her parents apparently like that guy too .
a week after that homeboy asked her to marry her during engagement bliss of holiday season and she said yes .
i did n't know any of this until i got back to the states .
i got back a couple of days after she got engaged .
she would n't even post the engagement on facebook until she told me first .
we talked deeply last week how she does n't know what the fuck is going in her life .
she almost sound like she was backed into a corner and she did n't know what do when he dropped on his knee .
she gave me a sob story on how she did n't even know she wanted to live and how shes not even thinking about her wedding .
even during the holidays her parents noticed how her mood changed for the worse .
she did n't even want to celebrate her engagement .
i 'm supposed to see her in two days to give her belongings back and if anybody read this jumbled mess thank you but what am i supposed to say to her when i see her ?
although i have read multiple guides and articles about powering up the characters the relation of soul boost with class up still feels ambiguous to me .
lets say for instance a i have a player with 21 of soul panels in class 1 1-300 lvl .
then i soul boost it to class 2 300-600 lvl and then get 95 of soul panels in class 2 .
for instance b i have the same player with 0 of soul panels in class 1 but after soul boosting it to class 2 i have 95 of soul panels of class 2 .
considering the fact that the same character in instance a and b has 95 of soul panels in class 2 at the end is my character in instance a more powerful that the one in instance b or they are the same ?
i have a character with lvl 1 in class 1 .
considering i have the items to ascend him to class 2 should i get the soul panels in class 1 before soul boosting it to class 2 or should i directly soul boost it to class 2 with 0 of soul panels of class 1 ?
to clarify this question even further will the soul panels i bought in class 1 affect the performance of my character in class 2 ?
this one is unrelated to the previous 2 questions and kind of silly .
does the order matter if you buy soul panels first and then train you character or train first and then buy soul panels ?
i am asking these questions because i have to increase the power level of my character with minimum resource and time consumption and i do n't want to waste my zeni 's and souls to buy a good amount of soul panels in class 1 when it makes virtually no difference once that character ascends to class 2 .

not too long ago i hatched a munchlax from a 7km yay me ! .
just a couple minutes ago today i was curious to see what the cp and hp would be if i were to evolve it .
but when i tried to check it does n't show the option to check what it 's evolved cp/hp would be for its evolved form snorlax .
i made sure my app is up-to-date v5.2.6 so ... no problem there .
all other 1st and 2nd stage pkmn show power-up predictions for their evolved form s .
so it would only make sense for it to be consistent with the newly winter released baby pkmn .
so i ca n't tell if goiv shows power-up prediction for their evolved forms mantine and chimecho .
it happened a few days ago after i downloaded a few apps from the play store .
every couple of minutes when i 'm using my phone a pop up ad appears and covers my phone screen .
sometimes 3 or 4 pop up at one time .
it is extremely annoying and i would love it if someone could help me out here as i 'm not very tech savvy .
is there an easy fix for this or do i need to take it in to a repair shop ?
one is a ssd that is mainly for the os and a 1tb hdd for everything else .
the other day i tried downloading a rather large torrent on the hdd 25gb and i kept getting crc errors .
i thought it was the torrent so i tried a different one .
i rebooted and it took waaay longer than usual .
now some programs that are installed on the hdd are n't even opening like firefox .
it 's a 1tb seagate hdd i bought in 2015 and i 'm currently running a seatools scan on it right now .
i started secondary school in 2015. start of middle school if you 're american .
year 7 i made lots of new friends but i was always kinda of the nerd .
we hung out because we were all our best choices .
the first thing i really felt growing up was the paris attacks in november 2015. the first time i felt those emotions .
sympathy loss and even though it was n't like i was directly affected by it i felt this sense of doom and sadness .
february 2016. sent my first valentine 's day card .
my best friend did it too to a different boy .
i got my other friend to give them to the respective people .
not sure if he ever found out it was me .
i most likely felt peer pressured and he was my 'crush ' .
the brexit referendum happened in june 2016. feels weird to reference a political event when talking about my teenage years however it 's definitely a way to pinpoint a certain time in my life and my given views at that point .
i was pretty shocked when the leave vote won .
i am happy to have had political views at quite a young age .
it was a week he 'd ignore me in the corridors and now the dude likes to pretend it did n't happen .
i remember just before summer 2016 coming out as gay .
sometimes i regret doing this but you ca n't change the past .
i ran around my school 's astroturf catching up with my friends and told them .
i was in my 12 year old emo phase and in the 'queer ' friendship group .
maybe i came up with the decision too quickly and just wanted to fit in .
it was a few years ago and i do n't remember much of it .
i had my 13th birthday and became a teenager .
for me i found this a bit intimidating because of things like my sexuality .
trump did n't seem like the accepting person you 'd want to lead a country to me .
i was growing away from some of my less close friends .
i had a lisp and id always been something of a point of amusement to some people .
they ask me to say words that i could n't say and laugh at me .
i probably made the right decision to stop hanging out with them so much .
i do n't remember much else happening in year 8. i was happy .
at the start of year 9 most of my classes changed .
i still was with some of my friends but id got comfortable with the group of 30 people that id seen every day at school for 2 years .
id started realising i had feelings for my best friend the prior summer .
my friend never really made an effort to try and talk to me .
ive always thought my problem was caring too much .
she stopped making an effort i stopped making an effort .
small things would make me angry and i hated it .
i still deal with this but it hurts thinking about it .
i had a shitty week and had had an even shittier day .
looking back i do n't know whether i really would have gone through with it .
mostly because im unreliable and i do n't know what im doing myself .
i met this girl online through a group chat about a music artist .
id spoken to her before but it was that night we really connected .
she did n't know i was suicidal but she made me happy .
she was 17 i was 14. kinda weird but i did n't care .
i was constantly fighting to recover between frequent relapses .
i just thought my life was much less important than someone else 's happiness .
the opportunities id had in the time that had passed since .
i have a theory that the only truly happy people are the ones that have found enough distractions or completely oblivious .
sure my life 's not perfect but i have recovered from where i used to be .
i knew i could n't be with her and she told me she deserved to know earlier .
do n't take the blame for things you did n't do .
suicide is never the best option and you always have something to live for .
if anyone wants to talk or ask questions pm or comment if you would like .
here is a problem i encountered when testing out computing packages neaderthal and fluokitten .
what i found out is if setting unchecked-math right before the foldmap call its effect wo n't penetrate the call .
yet if it is set as a global variable in project.clj then foldmap would be much faster .
unchecked-math warn-on-boxed is in effect the average run time is about 240us on my computer if it is not the average run time is about 5ms .
my question is why unchecked-math can not penetrate function calls .
is there any place i need to look after ?
i heard this game is good but i dont know what to do really .
i have played no mans sky and learned easily but with this one i am struggling .
does this mean that the player only can play a specific position ?
perhaps someone that shoots 'r ' would gravitate toward rw to naturally set-up a forehand shot as opposed to a backhand shot on the lw right ?
if the players prefer to play a specific position does this limit their marketability ?
say a team needs a rw and lw are only available to acquire .
why would they not all want to be classified/listed as a generic 'f ' instead ?
also why is a preference only declared for forwards e.g .
does the coach assign ld and rd or is it merely agreed upon among the players on the ice ?
i really hate the idea of separate dcs versions that are n't compatible with each other but i have standalone because i have modules from both the ed store and steam which works good enough .
i understand that new additions to the steam store starting from may 2017 will no longer be compatible with standalone .
i made sure to carefully check the product pages for the su33 and mig29 for the disclaimer that says they are not compatible with standalone but could n't find it so i bought them .
because these are older modules i figured they would still work on standalone but apparently not .
this whole system is incredibly frustrating especially because i ca n't use steam gift cards to get modules any more no f14 for me .
is my only option to install dcs on steam to use these two ?

every time they get a call need to call someone they have to take off their shoe s and use it as a phone .
it works as a phone and everything but it 's just a shoe .
not as much as my first play through but that 's a given .
want to spend more time as arthur as in my first play through i mainly focused on the main story because i just could n't get enough .
now that 's out of the way iv just noticed something really cool .

on some of my posts i almost get close to zero impressions from hashtags it 's very strange
i 'm struggling to find a way to reduce the dark circles around my eyes .
they seem to come and go in phases some days the circles wo n't be as prominent but other days they are noticeably worse .
here is a picture where they look brownish https imgur.com/ridkagc https imgur.com/ridkagc and here they look almost reddish https imgur.com/gyerypr https imgur.com/gyerypr .
i have generally clear skin i rarely get any acne other than the odd pimple here and there but i do struggle with some red blemishes that come and go .
i 've read that people have had success using a vitamin c product to reduce dark circles and was wondering if i should try that out or change my entire skincare routine as a whole .
i 've used the the cerave moisturizing cream and cetaphil gentle skin cleanser before but over time my skin started to have a negative reaction to them .
also i 'm not too concerned about the cost to reshape my skincare routine because i 've been having a hard time to find something that works .
any recommendations would help so much thank you guys !
however like one out every 500 or so messages gets dropped and never delivered to me or from me .
i 've confirmed this with friends saying they never got my message .
i 'm thinking between its some battery saving thing where it does n't want to wake my phone and if i do n't check within enough time it just never delivers .
deep down i know that she has n't tried reaching out to me .
i know that she does n't think about me at all .
even before it was obvious i am nothing to her .
but i ca n't help but wonder what-if ... what if she did try and i never got the message and now she thinks i 'm ghosting her

i 've seen and felt a dark sinister shadow when i was younger .
i 'd feel it grabbing me by the leg and dragging me .
i 've heard them called anything from incubi/succubus to et 's from higher dimensions observing .
regardless they or it freaked the fuck outa me ... causing me to scream but unable to do anything about it .
about 2 yrs ago i decided i was n't going to back down i was going to confront the being without fear .
after that i 've been able to astral project .
not to the akashick records where astral projectors claim to go or anywhere special just able to walk through the walls of my house and jump on my roof through the ceiling .
the only way to overcome that evil presence is to not be afraid at all .
try to act loving toward it if that makes sense .
and has anybody been able to physically change something in their astral bodies they can see the next day ?

my best idea so far is to get this https www.amazon.co.uk/benq-pd3200u-3840x2160-anti-glare-flicker-free/dp/b07glr6rqf/ref=sr_1_2 ? s=computers ie=utf8 qid=1546599506 sr=1-2 keywords=benq 2b4k refinements=p_n_feature_two_browse-bin 3a12128846031 th=1 as the primary centre monitor and buy another of the xl2411s and put one on either side .
as a woman i 'm really curious cos that happened to me couple times .

i wondered if there was a way to easily have a different launch configuration i.e .
what happens when you press f5 depending on the file/path/extension .
the first runs and debugs the mocha tests in the current file .
this only works if the current file is a typescript file with tests in it .
my second launch configuration i have set up runs my entire node application which i run from a custom json file which is the first argument to the main node entry file e.g .
this only works if the current file is a json file .
i either have to manually change the launch configuration or ctrl+p debug '' and then select the configuration .
even adding a keyboard shortcut to a particular launch configuration might help but i ca n't seem to do that either i can add one to a task but that does n't seem to help .
hello i had an idea which i tried to post this late last night it received 10 upvotes but no replies .
we can do better than that post your favorite/best tips !
a thread whose single purpose is to be a collection of helpful tips videos links for new players or veterans there is always something you do n't know ...
i 'll get started with what i found to be the most helpful for me personally video i have ever found .
it explains how to customize your camp spawn point .
now please share the most helpful stuff you have found so everyone can learn something new ! !
this topic was discussed here and there before but i have n't found a solution yet .
i built custom power switches based on 1wire protocol then i created homebridge plugin for it and it 's running pretty well .
i have a plan on expanding my invention to the world but the only thing that preventing me from it is an absence of android integration .
so basically i'de like my switches to be able to integrate in both ios and android .
even web-based solution homebridge-config-ui-x https github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x does n't work in my case since it ignores dynamic platforms .
i launched ring of elysium for the first time after downloading tonight .
then you receive your first prize to select from some type of random roll ... once i selected the prize and the game linked up to the servers to add prize to my account mine was 2000xp .
immediately after it kicked me from the game and the message appeared you have been banned for cheating behavior '' .
this was the first time launching the game and i did n't even get to load in a map ... clearly a glitch .
my theory ... as a free to play game they are attempting to use different methods of account verification as outlined in their terms of service '' which i was for-warned of on the review page .
there is a reviewer in the top few displayed that does a very good job explaining the method in detail .
it basically uses all these cookies etc ... to check your recent search social media profiles accessed from your machine or ip and some other fairly invasive stuff .
to prevent someone from cheating and hopping to a new machine with the free download .
it 's my belief that the attempted verification likely bounced back and forth between my home pc running shadow and my remote shadow pc .
i assume there was something it could not compute or recognized as multiple inputs or excessive machines attached ... whatever the hell it was it did n't like it .
support was super fast to respond and claims there is nothing to be done .
they actually claimed that my ban was likely because someone who previously used my remote pc had been banned using that specific one and grandfathered me into the ban and whoever has my machine next ...
from how shadow is explained each virtual machine should be like a brand new computer with a new fingerprint .
unless it logs the serial of the gpu or the windows serial i do not see how that would be possible .
there 's nothing they can or will do to fix it presently .
the fix i was suggested was use a different computer .
other than the fact that it has an anti-intuitive heaping pile of steaming buffalo shit as an interface
and how much do concrete masonry walls are bad for it ?
i might need a new ap so just want to be prepared .

stocks listen for the recommended penny stocks be of the first to buy them and low and then sell them gradually as to make money while the price of the stocks or shares climb and try to be of the first of whom who buy fairly low unless the overall trend of lows becomes too low from an overall value lowering trend .
do n't encourage mass sell offs and dumps without buying at least an equal amount of stocks from the same company once the value drops after sell offs because that loses alot of people alot of money figure a gradual trickle in both directions of supply while demand as to let the value of stocks increase steadily .
if people invest in good demanded quality valuing companies which are also service oriented for their customers 's and employees 's benefits while using this technique then everyone can win and society would be better off because of it and especially if they do n't panic everytime that someone tells them to .
the people could actually take control of the country 's destiny this way .
media and banks you got your social persuasion or brainwashing and your somatic encouragement which blend together to determine who wins and who loses and maybe even the whens .
taking the world back starts with people deciding to cooperate with each other to gain together which would boost the value of our economy by making it so that everyone gains while people collectively decide which companies should win and which companies should lose for society 's combined benefit .
serious investors could decide to become millionaires together by working together to get the price of stocks high while keeping long term increases in mind by constantly buying and selling stocks while keeping alot of them until people sell off one by one and everyone would have to hold their stocks during price drops unless they are the some people who decide to sell alot at the same time and then buy even more once the value drops after massive selling as to make even more money which would make the value increase again which would benefit every shareholder of the company in the long term .
by buying penny stocks in companies which promise green technology hands on and career focused public education which teaches people several career paths with all of the prequisites for the tasks of each career medical advancements and societal automation people could make alot of money while kick-starting an american golden age while using democracy .
make a blog and poll section on a website where people decide what stocks they are going to apply the world changing while gaining strategy to and click yes or no and the percentage of yes and no in relation to the total votes will be displayed with a company description .
of which are from suspected trolls and figure the best and worst tallies of yes and no by accounting for the troll votes .
maybe even add links to popular trading websites to make it even easier .
this approach to gaining while deciding the world would promote against monopolies because everyone would want to gain from penny stocks and a futuristic infrastructure in the future .

hi i 'm a minnesota gal and i 'm trying to workout so that i feel better about myself and my body .
in the winter it 's harder for me to be motivated to work out because all i really can do is run on my treadmill .
depending on how i feel sometimes i 'll be running for 30 minutes or an hour sometimes i 'll walk for an hour with an incline of 10 sometimes i 'll do interval running .
i workout on weekdays and tend not to on the weekends .
my diet is not the best because there 's really only junk food in my house which i usually do n't eat .
there 's also no ingredients in my house to cook my own food .
because there 's just not much healthy food in my house i usually choose to eat nothing rather than putting junk into my body .
i try to eat out a maximum of once a week .
could you please help me and give me a few pointers ?

tl dr how do you write stories that follow invest for a wizard-based ui ?
not sure if this is the right place to post such a question but i 'm hoping to get some advice on story-writing for systems/ui 's that use a wizard interface .
i generally try to follow the invest approach to story writing and it typically works out really well .
we have small stories usually independent of others which add value to the system for our customers and we can deploy once definition of done is met .
it 's straight forward and it works for us .
but right now we find ourselves working on a site that will involve some unavoidably complex user input the subject matter of this site is steeped in some somewhat complicated science as we are writing this for scientists and researchers to use and we all agree that a wizard user experience makes the most sense in these cases .
so now i 'm working with my team to write the stories for this set of screens and i 'm having a hard time breaking them down into bite-sized chunks .
encapsulating an entire wizard in a single story seems broken as the complexity of the rules behind what we 're building would make that 1 story take a good 4 sprints or more .
breaking individual steps of the wizard into their own stories is tempting but then the stories are no longer independent valuable without the other stories testable without the other stories in some cases and still are n't necessarily small .
do any of you have experience with writing stories for such a system ?
have you found anything that works or at least mitigates some of the awkwardness of the stories involved ?
thanks in advance to anyone who may have some words of wisdom on this matter !

though the day is relatively clear a low rumble of thunder passes over the pub as the portal opens .
a blinding flash of light accompanies it followed by the unmistakable smell of burning hair and cloth .
then an unexpected sound drifts through the portal a man 's voice spewing what can only be profanities in a harsh language based on the venom lacing the jagged words .
a small figure https www.reddit.com/r/wayfarerspub/comments/9ynkwz/meta_quick_character_reference_5/edoi5mz hops through the portal on one foot hair in a wild mane and one eyebrow missing altogether struggling with the bindings holding his scorched boot in place .
though he leans on his staff he loses his balance and falls .
he hits the ground with an 'oof ' then pops upright dark eyes widening as he sees the new surroundings .
smoldering boot forgotten he looks around suspiciously before heading towards the pub .
those patrons present on the ground floor are met with an odd sight a teenager with a tangled mop of black hair and missing an eyebrow lightly smoldering and with two of his toes protruding from a blackened hole in his boot .
despite this his posture is utterly confident almost nonchalant as if this is an everyday occurence .
he demands as he pats out a few smoldering patches on his robes .
there were empty seats all over the place she could 've sat anywhere else but she decided to sit next to me .

it seems that the concept of positive thinking isglorified .
every great idea has a huge following and some of them highlight its benefits in an exaggerated manner unaware of the downside of that idea .
it has less to do with the great idea itself than people who while supporting it interpret it in a very diverse ways .
motivational workshops and seminars have an agenda of pushing positive thinking philosophy at any cost .
they link this belief to a happy life and feel good outlook about general life .
a widespread hypothesis that positive attitude helps us to find a way out is just not right .
more than most things turn out very different than what was envisioned .
one finds that there is a difference between the reality and the imagination .
the more you force yourself to imbibe positive emotions the more negative setbacks are felt .
the force to imbibe positive feelings create a sort of burden in the minds of the person and he she starts feeling that fewer and fewer vibrations are coming .
in addition to this the feeling of everything is going to be alright has no cushion to fall back when things go wrong .
yes they often go wrong as per murphy ' law .
when things turn wrong the positive thinker may feel that he/she was not that positive to the required scale .
continually evaluating oneself on a positive scale and then things turning in opposite direction may be dangerous for the person who then puts himself herself in a swamp of continuous disappointment .
it may over a time lead to depression and violent reactions .
the opposite of positive thinking is not negative thinking .
the right approach is the balance between the two mindsets .
the true positive thinking is embracing all the possibilities of life in its various forms and ways .
the balanced mind has the ability to understand the negativity in its natural form and accept the situation in whatever way it turns out .
martin seligman who advocated positive psychology himself warned that too much of optimism may put a blind over our eyes from reality and the subsequent consequences may be quite different .
positive emotions are concerned with being content with one 's past being happy in the present and having hope for the future .
most important thing is these theories have not been proved empirically .

we already have solo and party tracker on our profiles .
the worst part of this system is that it only shows your highest badge no matter if it was achieved solo or party .
so set the profile badge to the highest and when in queue have it show the respective medal for that type of game .
profile shows divine 1 when q for party also divine 1 in the pick phase and when solo q it shows ancient 3 during pick phase .
another option could be to have the ingame medal be able to degrade but not change on the profile .
the closer to the reset the more i 've heard complaints of why is x rank in this game when they 're actually bad and people proceeding to just throw/give up or i 'm x ranks higher than you so give me x role when that role is clearly from party and they 're in strict solo q .
de spelers hebben een duidelijke opdracht wie is de mol ?
dit valt mooi samen met de 'opdracht ' van de kijker waar het programma ook ons fanatisme en onze inzet aan te danken zal hebben .
het doel van de mol is zo veel mogelijk geld uit de pot halen maar boven alles moet de mol voorkomen dat kandidaten weten dat hij de mol is .
de mol die express of gespeeld per ongeluk dingen fout laat gaan
je wilt als mol dus niet laten weten dat je de mol bent maar wel geld uit de pot halen dus brengt soms geld in het laatje om niet te verdacht te zijn en omdat je weet dat je misschien later geld uit de pot kunt halen .
aangezien steeds meer kandidaten proberen de verdenking op zich te krijgen kijk naar evi 's gedrag maar art was ook een goed voorbeeld denk ik dat de rol van de mol ook wat moet veranderen .
het is nu eigenlijk te makkelijk ja je moet eigenlijk geld uit de pot houden of halen maar kijk maar als je maar niet gesnapt wordt '' .
normaal gesproken eindigt de laatste aflevering op locatie 3 spelers met een zeer uitgebreide test 40 vragen in plaats van 20 vragen .
de laatste aflevering bij de test enkel de vraag wie is de mol ? '' .
als allebei de kandidaten het verkeerd hebben dan is de mol de winnaar en zijn er 2 verliezers .
hierbij de mol wel meer spelmogelijkheden geven om te mollen zonder dat het opvalt voor de kandidaten .
naar mijn weten is het nog nooit voorgekomen dat de mol niet geraden was maar misschien omdat dat nooit nodig was .
de uitgebreide test 40 vragen is een groots opgezette opdracht die altijd veel indruk maakt dus om die te behouden zou die ook in de een-na-laatste aflevering op locatie 4 spelers kunnen afspelen .

when i boot up i get to the apple logo and loading bar .
the loading bar fills up to random spots 50 75 100 and then the cursor appears in the top left .
i can move the cursor i can ssh into the machine i can even vnc into it which shows the loading screen too .
also i tried booting with the v flag and it never hangs it all passes and goes to the loading screen where it proceeds to get stuck .
therefore i have no direction in terms of what to debug .
3. added nvda\_drv=1 and injected nvdia drivers and set platform id to 3
6. followed this guide exactly to install web drivers https www.tonymacx86.com/threads ... er-on-high-sierra-black-screen-panics.234390 https www.tonymacx86.com/threads/fix-for-failure-nvidia-web-driver-on-high-sierra-black-screen-panics.234390 i installed version 105 .
7. rebooted and got a black screen but dvi worked i was using hdmi and so did remote desktop .
the mac at this point detected the gpu just fine but only dvi would work
it never booted again and always now gets stuck on the loading screen with the mouse
not really sure what to do at this point .
it does n't hang with v since it continues to the stuck screen with the mouse so i ca n't see any error logs or anything here .
the only thing i can think of is maybe i need to disable my igpu ?
the problem is though i do n't see a way to do that in my bios screenshots attached below .
the funny thing too is that i get stuck on the apple bootup screen but i have a cursor i can ssh i can vnc into the device which also shows the stuck bootup screen .
and if i just leave the computer in this state it will even put itself to sleep .
it 's as if the entire system is up and running but i 'm stuck on this loading screen and also hdmi and displayport do n't work .
does anyone have any ideas what i can do ?
so my girlfriend broke up with me but i was n't too pissed bc i was kind of thinking about it so i suppose we were n't really compatible but the next day she wanted to get back together and i said no then i find out today that 20 mins before she asked to get back together she asked a girl out the girl said yes .

tom pyrion ... you boys together are just brilliant commentators .
i mean look pyrion you 've always been a good commentator but just with tom it 's such a fun dynamic that because we only get it in the poker streams means its a rare treat but a bloody good one .
honestly i can understand why you get angry pyrion at the poker players .
it 's funny but you 're also right in saying it 's a game and that you would n't want people to be yelling at you .
at the end of the day though i do n't really mind .
you make poker so much more entertaining and to be honest i myself didnt really know poker or any strategies before watching and most of what i learnt i got from pyrions tips so cheers .
after listening to a few podcasts by dr rhonda i 'm giving tre a try 8am to 6pm eating during weekdays/most days .
the first night i slept well and woke up like a champion .
since then i 've been getting to by by 8-9pm and waking up between 12am and 1am with great difficulty falling back asleep .
i 've seen many posts about general fasting and insomnia but wondered if people had good info on tre and insomnia .
otherwise i 'll have to continue to eat up to 8-9pm like i 've done most of my life as insomnia is not worth the autophagy trade-off .
i 've taken melatonin and had chamomile and valerian root tea before bed which helps falling but not staying asleep .
basically 6 mana filters for 6 instead of just 6 .
also ixalan button on the left is is n't fully visible anymore but still works .
sadly to say i think im gon na be leaving the community .
i havent been her long but it doesnt make me feel very good .
everytime i 've made a post about my love it seemed to be met with either a negative comment or oogling which makes me uncomfortable .
which really sucks because whenever other people post about their so 's everyone is very respectful to them .
im sure this community has some really cool good hearted people in it but it seems its not for me .
i wish you all happiness and joy with your so 's .
ibuki i will be riding by ourselves from now on as well as a select friend i made here .

hi guys and girls could you be so kind and direct me to some mod or map script that generates a map containing two continents but all of the civs start on one of them ?
i tried looking on the workshop but was n't sucessfull .
if it works in multiplayer that would be even better .
i do n't like looking through phones and such but she has been acting very unusual lately which made me curious .
we used to have sex almost every single day or at least every other day but we have n't had sex in three weeks now .
we 've had sex only four times in the last two months .
however we have not actually completed an act of sex in over 3 months !
what i mean by that is even though we started to have sex on four separate occasions during the last couple months we never finished because every time she ends up becoming drier down there gentleman than the sahara desert !
she gets dry so boredom sets in and she starts laughing and telling jokes so we obviously stop trying ...
she claims to not know why this is happening but it is n't me or us but the complete lack of sex along with the fact that she is so silent at times made me curious .
when i say silent i mean she will not text/call/or talk to me for days on end unless i do first .
her behavior and lack of sex led to me looking in her phone where she visited her ex-husband 's house to see their 2 children 8 10 .
she divorced her husband roughly 7 years ago and has been married and divorced since .
but they still do n't get along so i 'm told so her ex-mother-in-law stays at the house when my girlfriend visits her kids every couple weeks .
she has passionately explained that her ex is never ever there when she is because he spends time with his current girlfriend .
before you suspect that i am insecure or whatever i never said anything about her ex .
in fact i had assured her of my trust between them if he is there all i ask to know is if he is actually there .
but she is allowed to spend her time with whomever .
looking through pictures on her phone her ex has definitely been there with her and they have taken numerous smiling selfie‚Äòs together .
until i saw the messages between them on facebook messenger .
his current girlfriend had called to ask if my girlfriend had been sleeping with her ex husband .
my girlfriend asked him why she was asking and he said she was curious .
she asked what to tell her and he said it did n't matter .
according to the chat she told him that she told his girlfriend that they did n't have sex but she was asking him if that was the right thing to say because she was n't sure what to do .
he said it would all work out either way but telling her ‚Äòno ' was the right answer .
based on what she was saying i am positive she had sex with him and admitted it .
i am so upset but i 'm also upset that i even looked and i 'm afraid that i do n't know how to bring any of this up .
she does not really have any friends so i ca n't exactly say that i heard this somewhere because she also does n't have family .
how in the world can i confront her about this without it all turning around on me ?
so maybe most of you wont care but i figured i dont really have anyone to talk to about this so maybe i have reddit for that d
i started watching nalcs around 2012 and was rooting for tsm from the start .
i continued watching until 2016 and in the years of 2016 2017 i had a break from league both game and esport .
and then i came back at 2018 started playing and watching again that means i witnessed and rooted for all tsm rosters except the 2016-2017 roster which by what i gather online was one of the fanbase favorites if not the most favorite .
anyways thats all just wanted to share this with you it kinda feels wierd to me not recognizing and fully knowing the most liked roster for the team i root for all these years ofc i know the players now and from before but didnt really get to watch them play together i get that it was probably super fun
ps day 1 was an absolute blast lets crash it this year !

hey guys on mobile here so sorry about formatting .
i 've had my dog for 10 years now got him when he was 2 months old from an amish breeder on the east coast i know better now but i was just a kid then .
he 's had a slew of health problems over the year 2 torn acls with full surgeries for both an incurable genetic skin disorder that caused all his fur to fall out and killed his tear glands and most recently a fatty tumor that has been growing on his foot .
our vet recommended just leaving it so we listened but it just exploded today and now he 's bleeding a fair amount .
i plan on taking him to the vet but i just wanted some opinions on if anyone thought his quality of life was compromised at this point .
the loss of tear ducts has caused him to be nearly blind in both eyes .
his surgeries have given him arthritis and he only gets up for food and for forced bathroom breaks .
if we did n't get him up to go potty then it would just skip out while he 's sleeping onto the floor .
i guess i 'm just looking for any advice or opinions on what you all would do .
i love him so much but i do n't want to hold on to him for my sake .
i have watched the season 3 finale so many times i also cried that many times but every single time the fact that the neighborhood is set in the medium place in mindys backyard passes over me and i forget .
but anyways ... derek explained that mindy found the plunger in her backyard that rebooted him just like the button in the original neighborhood for janet .
he exclaimed that she rebooted him roughly half a million times when she was bored or needed alone time .
since derek is a janet baby and janet created 321 more janet babies does that mean that if mindy gets bored or needs alone time and pulls the plunger all of the residents will be rebooted too ?

lastly is there a way to determine what firmware is currently installed on my f5 board ?
i would like to have a backup copy of a known working firmware but i understand you ca n't download it from the printrboard itself so i figure a copy of the same version from the printrbot github site is the next best thing .

i 've been using jenkins for 2 years and recently started migrating all our apps to docker .
jenkins has worked great so far and was even fine when i added docker/docker-compose commands to the pipelines but now that i 'm trying to migrate jenkins to use docker and be a more disposable environment it 's been like using hand sanitizer when you have paper cuts all the pain you did n't know you had has come up ...
i 've looked briefly at gitlab concourse and drone and have like the look of drone so far .
this is just based on quick looks and not in-depth testing .
has anyone made the jump from jenkins to drone and have an opinion ?
i know gitlab gets a ton of love on this sub but the thing i like about drone is its plugin system looks like a good replacement to jenkins shared libraries .
our jenkins library was primarily a couple of functions that parsed my code coverage and code style error output files and then sent a notification to slack with build status and the coverage/style errors .
i assume there are ways to do this in gitlab and concourse sidecar containers im guessing ?
i 'm pretty open right now since jenkins has been driving me crazy in the last week or two .
i am new to the sub r/havewemet and what i wanted to ask was how people would feel about this kind of character .
i 'm just toying with the idea right now and i still have n't decided so if you guys could also recommend what kinda schoolgirl role i could play would be great

i heard there 's a new best way to level up in groups that do n't involve rat runs but involve an impale dh .
i am so glad it involves different classes other than a necromancer and barb but i need to know more about this .
sorry if this is a dumb question but i wanted to clarify something .
are wild spawns and their subsequent ivs directly connected to the player level ?
for example if i 'm level 28 will a spawn with 100 iv be max level 28 ?
if i 'm above level 30 will it max be level 30 or can it be above that too ?
i 'm using latte dock both for my dock and my plasma top panel .
problem i 'm finding with the plasma panel is as you can see in the picture icons are not vertically aligned in the panel which looks a bit ugly .
it 's particularly noticeable with lock/logout widget but also with the digital clock in the center of the panel and the widget for the kde menu minimal menu .
global menu is the only widget that looks really ok in the panel .
i 've played with the planel height see if i found the right size where everything looks ok from 20px to 28px currently it 's left at 24px but it 's always the same or even more noticeable at larger heights .
i 've been doing some online search but have n't found any solution .
been playing with latte settings but there does n't seem to be any to help with that .
i tried different plasma themes and was the same .
if there is no solution i can live with it as it is right now of course .
or i can always go back to normal kde panel which did n't have this issue or at least i did n't notice it .
edit i guess i do n't really knonw how reddit works .

it 's to do some freelance work in my spare time although it is n't likely to bring in much income .
i do n't imagine i will be hitting ¬£5000 profit per year from the freelance work but of course my combined income will be greater than this so do i pay class 2 national insurance ?
also am i right in thinking that 20 is paid to tax from the outset because my personal allowance is already used up for my main employment ?
when do i have to declare income etc if i began trading tomorrow ?
can money be claimed back on expenses such as wifi etc .
i 'm a real newbie to all things tax so i appreciate your help .
i heard there 's a new best way to level up in groups that do n't involve rat runs but involve an impale dh .
i am so glad it involves different classes other than a necromancer and barb but i need to know more about this .
looking for players who might be able to help my little brother with daily gifts .
have you spent 1000 of bucks on a digital marketing agency and got nothing out of it ?
it is a fact that your business wo n't survive without having the support of digital media marketing .
many people choose the wrong digital marketing agency https www.google.com/url ? q=https 3a 2f 2fwww.chameleondigitalmedia.com 2f sa=d sntz=1 usg=afqjcnfiiaix0rnqsrkfs86awfilw8j5kw .
they have ended up wasting a lot of money and opportunity to grow .
i just finished the final chapter all my playthroughs have been on proud mode and i have all the xehanort reports but the last video i have in the theatre is where the heart goes .
every year it 's up 5-6 and i wonder what i 'm getting for it .
i pay almost 400/month in property taxes and still have to call the city after every snowstorm since they plow me in i 'm the last house on a dead end street .
before you read what i 'd like to share with you i want to say a viewpoint about those abilities we gain while stopping masturbation .
i strongly beleive that cutting masturbation by itself does help us to become better at some points in our lives but what contributes more is that new mindset you frame while stopping masturbation .
that mindset full of desire motivations inspiration of creating a new lifestyle .
i had streaks where the only thing i was thinking about was not to masturbate to avoid masturbation .
well eventually i would relapse ... i would relapse cause i had that very lack of mindset .
at the 10th day of my streak i do see some changes
1 eye contact fuck i can confidently look in the eyes of every girl without the tiniest timidity and look until she looks away .
before i would look in and then immediately pool my sight away .
well it doesnt mean that i can get the hottest girl in the town ... perhaps not yet heheh .
3 sex drive i have fucking sworn next time i have an orgasm i am gon na have a girl beside me .
all my sex desires were getting accomplished by masturbation ... .things have changed folks !
1 more self-control goddamit i googled a sex topic yesterday cause i wanted to learn some tips for future use hahahaha .
and i got an erection ... .10 days ago i would masturbate like the worst maniac ... but yesterday i said to myself really ?
i didnt masturbate read those tips and felt fcking like a god hahahah
2 great mood i am feeling like i am the mentally cleanest person upon the surface of the earth ... i dont wake up with the thought that i fucked myself up yesterday night or even worse i started my day with masturbation ... that shit is not for me .
3 work work well this means that when i do something i am concentrated on my work only .
the truth that this has just began to be seen
that 's it bros ... comment please your improvements .
the first chunk is done second chunk is in progress and the bael chunk at the end is the same as ever .
alright now is where the part is getting interesting .
it 's only about 1,000 words longer than yesterday but i think i have a good idea how to continue the battle between satan diablo and lucifer .
one of the things we have n't seen much of in cryopod but i intended to make happen at some point is combination abilities . ''
up to now satan and uriel have demonstrated their ability to use multiple powers and elemental abilities at the same time but they 've never combined their abilities to create new ones .
by that i mean that uriel might fling some fireballs some water missiles shake the earth and likewise for satan but they 've never combined two or more abilities together to create a new effect .
in avatar the last airbender and korra something like this happens with sandbending mudbending lavabending bloodbending metalbending etc .
the idea is to combine earth and water to create mud or fire and earth to create lava .
in fact he 's a very intelligent mid-battle tactician .
i do n't want him to die to a pebble like in classic but instead to reveal new things about the character 's abilities because he intuitively and instantly recognizes the potential satan 's diverse moveset has .
so after work today when i start writing much of the remainder of the part will be about hercules exploiting satan 's powers in ways the demon emperor never thought possible either due to not connecting the dots or because he has n't had much time to think about improving his skills with the powers he already has .
i hope you guys enjoy the part today and since this is friday i will be finishing up my third week at lowe 's .
the job hurts my feet pretty bad still but it really is easy mindless work .
after this confusing battle finishes the remaining parts will be much easier and faster to write .
i 've already outlined what should happen leading up to the war in heaven .
though the war in heaven itself is going to be a fairly long multi-part arc .
not the normal type of post but i need you geniuses ...
i attend university and was sick on wednesday so i took some medicine and stayed at home i sent an email to my lecturer and he was cool with it .
thing is he can not control absences and so i was advised to go and have a word with the office staff ...
i sent an email instead they respond with and i quote ... 'in order for you absences to be authorised you will need to provide certifiable documentation which covers your absence ' .
clearly i do n't have 'certifiable documentation ' and so i call them to let them know that i obviously wo n't have documentation because i stayed at home they respond with 'without certifiable documentation you were n't ill you have to bring in some evidence to prove your illness is there anything else we can help you with ? '
few minutes later the light bulb moment i do have a bin full of snot-filled tissues which i am considering taking in but i want to seriously piss them off ...
i am looking to use notion to facilitate the scheduling of volunteers for an event .
the event is multiple days and has different volunteer roles with different length time slots .
finally we get a strange new world to explore .
the awkward humor was tuned down from s02e01 and burnham was kind of moved back a bit to give the episode more of an ensemble feel .
i mostly hated the first season but if the show continued on this path and keeps more of an episodic feel with a somewhat loose arc i could see myself eventually becoming a fan .
i liked him much better in the 2nd episode than the first .
i would like to see him stay on as the official captain of dsc .
i just do n't think every season has to have such steep odds as michael burnham has to save the universe '' .
i would n't mind a show done in this style that just explores and solves ethical quandries and has a cool captain .
i 'm burned out on the fan service already and i think tying mb to spock and sarek weakens her character and makes her character seem like an easy fan service cash-in .
i hope they back off the tos connections going forward .
frakes is a phenomenal director and if they want this show to be accepted keeping alumni in creative positions is a great step in the right direction .
i put them in milk and they sizzle at me

do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor good battery life or best specifications for the money ?
pick or include any that apply. do n't need 2-in-1 form factor but am open to options .
battery life must be reasonable and i 'm looking for the best value for money .
how important is weight and thinness to you ? does n't need to be the thinnest laptop so long as it is n't too bulky or heavy .

list which programs/games you desire to run. will be doing cad such as sketchup and cura for 3d printing .
possibly video editing and possibly light gaming such as minecraft or hearthstone
if you 're gaming do you have certain games you want to play ?
at what settings and fps do you want ? possibly would like to play minecraft at above 50fps and hearthstone at any reasonable frame rate .
any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ? just needs usbs and headphone jack
leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion. need best value for money laptop that can be used for uni and for some 3d modelling in sketchup and possibly light gaming .

how is arbiter vildred meant to be built and used ?
the cr reduction on 2 targets for his 1 suggests speed to me and his s3 seems to do so little damage its laughable but when i got him i had hoped to use him as a compliment to my violet due to the blind and as the main damage in a cleave arena team .
tywin baal cleaver schuri the low damage on his s3 at 2400 attack is discouraging me .
i know that attack is low but he is only 2 star awakened and level 50 at the moment but before i take him further i want to know if he can fill the roles i 'd hope he would and how i would need to build him to make him fill those roles .
i am aware that there are better farmers and better cleavers but for these roles my options are clarissa ml vildred and celestial mercedes .
i guess this is more of an opinion question but
2 years ago i got in an accident and the other car got fixed my insurance paid for it .
im guessing his lease was up and he returned the car because i got a letter from my insurance company saying the leasing company was requesting diminished value in amount of 8,500 .
but since they had already used my max coverage to repair the vehicle they directed the leasing company to sue me if they wanted the money .
my insurance company stated in the letter it was questionable if they had a claim and if they contacted me to let them know so they can represent me .
my main questions is how likely are they to contact me i can understand trying to go through an insurance company and make a claim get the money easy but will they go through the trouble of trying to sue me ?
i know you can get them in store and on ebay and amazon .
i would prefer to order from ebay but i ca n't find the right ones .
link me or tell me what to search for or something .

i 've been an rn about 5 years now .
started in icu for 2.5 and now been in ortho 2.5 .
i initially became an rn because when i was younger i wanted to do nurse researching .
however i 've since learned i just want to do a job that makes me happy and feel fulfilled .
icu burned me out quickly especially at a county spot and ortho is boring but alright .
i 've since decided to go back and get my msn .
i live in los angeles california and make roughly 60/h which with my spouse is completely livable .
but i do plan on kids in the next 5 years so a better paying job would be nice .
i chose education so that i could stay with my current job one day a week and teach clinical twice .
but the pay is about the same to be a clinical prof and makes me feel like getting an msn is pointless .
what path did you guys take if you got your msn ?
is the pay significantly better and does it make 2.5-3 years of school make sense ?
what kind of jobs are there for msn rns in general ?
what has being an rn msn been like for you ?
any tips of jobs with msn would be nice too !
bitcoin will be worthless during the second half of the 2020s and all of the 2030s and 2040s .
bitcoin might be worth something again by about 2050 .
not as an alternate currency but as a collector 's item similar to baseball cards stamps or old toys .
there might be somebody who 's interested in collecting the stupid fads of decades earlier .
with that being said bitcoin would be selling at about .50 2 if it becomes a collectors item not 3,500 like it is now .
need to find a god father for my daughter .
i have 3 brothers and a brother in law .
i need the worst multiplayer game you can think of that we can play remotely .
if there was a my little pony death match game that would work .
extra points if it 's girly or completely terrible in an amazing way .
so my mom and sister lose their apartment and need to stay with my dad and i for a couple weeks .
i 'll skip over most of the nightmare they 've caused for us since i 'm not trying to air all my familial grievances here but one issue has just gone way too far .
one is an absolute angel that just quietly keeps to itself and enjoys being pet .
now i like this dog well enough but my sister spends all her time with him 24/7 when she 's not at work .
i 'm not sure what her old plan was but the new plan is he shits all over my goddamn house because he is n't trained to tell people when he needs to take a shit '' .
the dog actually is n't house trained at all .
we have tried to address this but the most we can get her to do is ... clean it up .
but the cat just made my personal shit list .
this obese fucker has some sort of depression or some shit and it literally just lays in it 's fucking litter box .
we had to set up another litter box because she was forcing the other cats to have to piss on the carpet .
but the true issue is what this disgusting creature does when it leaves the litter box .
it 's an extremely fluffy cat so spending all that time in the litter gives it plenty of time to get dried turds and piss clumps all stick in her fur which then get distributed throughout most of the rest of the house .
thank god she 's too lazy to come upstairs where my room is .
apparently while washing the cat from it 's most recent sandbath my sister up and forgot to remove one of the turds she washed off so right as i 'm settling into a nice relaxing bath i look to my right and get a face full of dried-but-remoistened ancient cat turd .
i am so beyond done with these fucking animals .
trying to process what is going on in young justice so i created a list of the role and how important each group is to the rest of season 3 .
the outsiders nightwing 's squad is at the front of anti-meta-human trafficking efforts by the deathstroke led shadows .
given that this is the group at the center of most of the meta-trafficking on earth they will probably receive a lot of screen time .
batman inc/robin squad merged because of close connection unknown scale of batman inc. means that this organization 's presence around the world can boost the outsiders ability to combat the shadows or become an example of vigilantism that pushes more regulations on the justice league .
main league reduced operational capacity leaves the league as useless unless an event is so blatantly public that the league 's intervention can not be question .
mainly cold opens or short clips for the rest of the season except final battle .
the team responsible for odd ball jobs that come to the jl meaning that they could be very important depending on what comes their way or filler .
off world league literally being off world means we probably wo n't see them unless a galactic level event happens .
deathstroke and the shadows if the light most powerful force on earth responsible for all smuggling operations .
no criminal influence scheme can be complete without atleast one shadow present .
as the foil to the outsiders the new shadows will be the primary villain from the light on earth
savage with possession of the war world essentially the ambassador of the light to the rest of the galaxy .
any galactic level event will probably be paired with savage .
edit forgot to add the only human that could summon the might of darkseid as the ambassador for the light .
luthor weakest physically member of the light also happens to be the one single handedly reducing the influence of the jl .
mainly cold opens that show the un in the future .
queen bee the only ruler of a country in the light her country will house the most sensitive parts of the lights operations including stealthier boom tubes weapons and other meta activities .
whether or not she plays a prominent role is whether or not light activity is centered in bialya or elsewhere .
whether this is season 4 material or season 3 is anyone 's guess .
the ultra humanite replacing the brain as the light 's chief scientist he 'll probably activate the meta-powers of future heroes and villains .
mars a planet with a very high population growth rate rigid social system and where every person is essentially armed is asking for a civil war .
with at least one martian attempting to raise support for a revolution its not difficult to see this place becoming a battleground between galactic forces .
the reach in conflict with the guardians of the universe its not difficult to think that they could turn their attention to either apokolips .
ra 's organization he was dethroned from the shadows but sent information to them regarding the outsiders meaning he could swing towards the league or the light depending on how he feels .
his main problem is that he has less assets than the other groups on this thread .
so his next move might collecting assets to project more influence maybe even form his own team .
looking at this i think the second half is leaning towards outsiders vs. the shadows with everything else being secondary .
it 's crazy to have it all be sober the meeting the intense chemistry the getting to know the person the places where you have to reveal and be vulnerable ... it 's all sober it 's all real me even if that sometimes has all the grace of a blindfolded elephant serving tea .

i 've only played the campaign game to kinda give me a feel of the game .
and i 've mostly just played local multi-player with my brother .
is there a way for me to join a game with strangers ?
you were on your way to a house party invited by your friend .
the drive was long through the city then town and finally countryside but soon you arrived at a large rural house .
as you stepped out of the car the music was blasting from inside .
people from all over were inside welcoming you as each would compliment you on virtually every part of your body .
there were n't many guys at the party either entirely absent aside from one or two .
the night was filled with booze partying vomiting all the fun stuff .
after a quick bathroom break you noticed all these kinds of strange white worm things crawling around near the back room .
too drunk to care you carried on back out front .
after downing your 9th beer for the night you passed out promptly .
what you did n't know is that the party was actually a coven of witches each meeting every night to swap bodies .
each night had more options and you were in for quite the surprise when you awoke .
but what was the last thing you could remember ?
she and i have a great connection physically and mentally .
we made out on the couch like a couple of teenagers .
but i have been single for the past 8 years because it has been hard for me to open up and be vulnerable to a woman .
because of the emotional abuse of my last relationship .
we have been chatting for a couple of weeks .
i guess my question is how do i say as a male .
i was emotionally physically abused in my last relationship .
i 've been using 81 talbot for 300 games and he 's been putting up really good numbers consistently .
ever since they released the beta tuner and the new tuner he 's been absolute trash every game .
i 've tried 83 murray 87 parent 87 smith seen a lot of ppl use them now but no luck .
i 've recently decided that i 'm going to get into networking and network attached storage .
i 've acquired a large amount of cat6a cable and decided that i 'm going to start making my my own patch cables .
after doing research online i 've come across that there are two wire layout for an rj-45 connector t568a and t568b .
all the information i 've read online seems to be conflicting as to which one you should use .
was hoping you guys could shed a little light on the topic .
both of my cats seem like they could benefit from wet food one of them is overweight and the other could use more water and seems to get sick after most fry foods .
for the overweight one he 's a maine coon mix that 's 22 pounds what would be a good feeding schedule ?
should i give him some dry and some wet of just stick to wet and a strict feeding schedule/amount ?
the problem with dry food is that he does n't eat it all at once and it 's hard to tell which cat is eating out of which bowl so i never know exactly how much he has eaten .
the other cat is very very picky about food and generally does n't enjoy wet food at least the kinds you can get at target .
she 's less picky about dry food but she 's the one that vomits more .
should i ditch dry food completely or do some of both ?

there was this amv on youtube for a while and they used the song with clips from the movie .
this was how i found out about the movie and i have watched it 4 times since .
i think that this song expresses the feelings in the movies and the beat drops really hit hard .
my favorite aspect of the movie is definitely shoya 's friendship with yuzuru .
it 's so great seeing them get along my favorite scene is where yuzuru asks shoya to walk her to her grandmothers funeral .
the soundtrack of the movie is amazing and i have it on repeat from spotify .
but i also wish the movie had more closure to the relationship of shoya and shoko it feels like shoya reached his goal of making shoko happy and stuff but i feel like it leaves their ending together kind of open .
overall awesome movie read the manga gon na watch it in theaters subbed not dubbed ! !
edit they reuploaded the amv with 8d audio this time ! !
does it take a long time to unlock the titans and whatnot ?
i 'm wondering if the ultimate edition is worth the extra cost if otherwise it 'd take forever to unlock stuff .
when it gets below about 15-20¬∞ f until the cabin temperature warms up the windshield wipers will go on low or high and can not be turned off .
pressing the auto/sensor wiper button at the end of the wiper stalk might or might not illuminate the light for a half second during which time the wipers stop since it is not raining then it goes out and the wipers go on again .
holding the wiper stalk down is moderately more successful but even holding it while driving wo n't keep them from coming on .
we have a few cold days coming up so i am thinking about just taking the fuse for the wipers out but obviously this is not an ideal solution .

whenever someone brings up nav in the conversation all i hear is hate .
everyone seems to hate nav for his persona and his bland music .
however i think nav is a very talented artist .
his song champion is quite catchy and uses many music motifs making it different and unique .
nav has a unique sound that should be cherished and celebrated .

generally any sort of meme with anything dd-related in it is allowed it 's just when the meme has nothing dd-related and a title like mfw the shambler kills me '' that it veers into low-effort spam posting .
quirk posts are an exception because they 're spammed so much that literally nothing else would show up on the front page if they were n't banned and because it 's almost always kleptomania or skilled gambler known cheat and the reposting is getting a bit ridiculous seriously i 've removed those two posts around 30 times in the past week and that 's just me a single mod .
we 've also had a lot of bots spamming game is x off '' we 've been banning them as rapidly as possible but there are tons of them .
even the darkest dungeon is x off '' ones are almost always spambots that often link to suspicious sites please report these immediately so we can ban them .
it 's 100 allowed to post when dd is on sale and even encouraged but we do n't allow bots to spam this subreddit whether it 's dd-related or not .

assuming she would randomly choose a deck with no synergy i chose sheep grannies to keep things fair .
she beat me 15 to 8 after denying 4 vp through card abilities .
in my defense it was my first time with sheep and grannies and i 'd never seen either in play .
turns out they 'd both be good support factions but i could n't figure out how to make either take the lead .
plus i fought a little too hard for a couple bases when i should have let her have them .
anyone else struggled hard against insanely synergistic random drafts ?
next time i wo n't pick a poor synergy !
so people do n't have to keep asking for them or making new ones
regarding the feedback of the upcoming akali nerfs i see many people akali mains and even those that despise akali saying we 're fine with the shroud/obscured nerf but why the healing nerf on q ? ''
i do n't think people understand one of the main things that makes akali obnoxious and frustrating to play against is that she 's an assassin with sustain not just her shroud mechanic .
assassins are champions that burst you down in a rotation of abilities .
they should n't be out-sustaining laning opponents through a built in healing mechanic .
this is doubled by the fact that akali is n't mana based and has even more sustain from being an energy based champion .
the only assassins or the majority of assassins that have sustain potential are junglers that need sustain for the jungle which include nidalee rengar yi kayn etc .
and that makes sense but sustain lane assassins are obnoxious and frustrating to play against .
what i think they should do and will do is give her more damage on her q and e but the healing part of akali 's q definitely does n't need to remain .
i 've only played against an akali probably 4 times since her rework .
hello all just checking in to provide some facts in this fud-ridden mess .
some nodes and block explorers are out of sync with the network but you can check coz-mon http monitor.cityofzion.io to see the current block height .
secondly fork is certainly not the right word to describe what happened .
we 've talked about this particular issue before and have taken to calling them 'block sporks . '
this is because unlike a blockchain fork where one side of the network continues consensus on one chain and the other side continues consensus on another the 'sporked ' block/chain is dead on arrival .
it happens when a consensus node acting as speaker broadcasts a block and receives signatures from the other consensus nodes .
since it now knows the block it proposed is valid/agreed it then updates its own state with the new block height but for whatever reason disconnect etc does not propagate the block to the other nodes .
the other nodes seeing that the original speaker is not propagating a block start a new round of consensus for the same block height .
the end result is one node that thinks its block is at height x but the other nodes all agree that their block is the real height x .
like a fork two blocks at the same height exist .
unlike a fork only one side of the chain continues .
if that single node reconnects in time to let rpc nodes/block explorers grab the next block from it they 'll end up stuck since the next block will never follow from that one .
that 's why you start seeing issues like explorers going out of sync or transactions not being relayed from light wallets like neon or o3 which rely on those rpc nodes .
some of you may remember that this first happened last august https neonewstoday.com/general/neo-dos-vulnerability-patch-and-fork-incident-details .
the issue is that neo 's dbft is n't using all three stages of consensus it was n't 'locking ' states until all nodes were in 100 guaranteed agreement .
shargon coz/red4sec was the first to note this discrepency and started work https github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/320 to add this third phase of consensus to neo 's dbft .
unfortunately work had already started to refactor neo to use the akka model https github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/288 .
ordinarily shargon 's changes would have been merged and we would n't have this annoying little issue anymore but because of the refactor the fix needed to be redone too .
shargon restarted work on the akka version https github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/422 of the third consensus phase which was then incorporated into neoresearch 's optimized dbft update https github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/426 .
as this is quite a big patch i believe some of the changes are being moved to smaller commits .
either way in testing consensus is now working properly and we can expect to see this permanent fix happen in the near future .
for now it 's just a bit annoying because some rpc node runners will need to re-sync myself included üòÖ and block explorers will need to correct their databases .
using light wallets/explorers might be a bit iffy until nodes get resynced .
a permanent fix to this issue is ready to roll out .
not sure which specific bomber/bombers it is but my bombs will resupply not the guns .
it 's a right pain in the arse ... am i supposed to just ditch the thing ?

my income is not taxed by germany but a portion of my income is taken out and goes to brussels i work for an eu institution .
i think paying american taxes on my income here is ridiculous .
so what happens if i not only do n't pay but if i do n't file my taxes at all ?
i 've read a few times online that it can result in fines . ''
what are the chances that they 'll find out ?
just fyi i 've been living outside the us now for 5 years .
i was n't making more than 10k a year before this past year .
i started a second job at the start of january cause i 'm sick of having debt my partner is back in college and a close friend is getting married in mexico in october and i would n't miss it .
now i have two jobs that require standing on my feet and lifting/bending/etc .
i leave for job at fast food chain at 530 in the morning to start at 6 then finish at 130 and catch the bus to the salon i work at as a hairstylist my career to start at 230 and i stay until my last client or whenever i 'm done doing mani/pedi training trying to expand my skills .
i am exhausted but i am slowly becoming so proud of myself for working through it .
i hurt i feel like i can fall asleep on my feet my hips want to spasm here and there my worst spots but i 'm doing it and i 'm so proud of myself .
i want to be a provider and i want to move and this is giving me that confidence boost .
i 'll be the first to admit that my fibro is n't as bad as some .
i am mostly mobile and i am capable of working and i have medications that work for me to an extent nothing is perfect .
so i do n't want my work habits to be a criticism of anyone else 's because that is n't what this is .
i am just proud of myself and want to share .
i decided to make this post in response to the discussions that were had last night about harris ' town hall .
most notably users both here and in nl were upset by a few things she said and supported in the town hall support for a green new deal fair trade and protectionism support and supporting medicare for all .
as most people reading this know these arent exactly popular policies around here .
cost inefficiency and being inferior to other policies are why we dont tend to like them .
however i 'm here to talk about why that doesnt matter and it is because of one thing in particular the us senate .
the senate as it is currently established heavily disfavors democrats .
because of this democrats winning control of a majority is very difficult in this day and age .
more importantly however is the legislative filibuster where senators can block bills from passing the senate unless they can get 60 votes to end cloture .
this means that the opposition can stop most bills from passing through the senate .
as democrats will not be able to gain 60 or more senators any time soon any bill that can not get past this 60 vote is dead in the water .
but what if the dems hit 50 senators and end the filibuster ?
like i said dems are disadvantaged in the senate and if they kill the filibuster as soon as the gop gains the senate back which they are easily able to they will have free reign and the dems wo n't be able to stop them .
this leaves the dems without any ability to pass more liberal bills as they will die in the senate even if they control it .
now let 's relate this back to the primarys .
every non meme candidate in this primary is going to be endorsing things like the green new deal and medicare for all .
no version of these bills similar to the aoc or bernie plans will be able to pass .
hell the public option or any climate change bill will be difficult to pass .
this means that any dem who wins is going to have power to do executive orders foreign policy and nominate judges .
these are the things that you will be voting on in this primary .
it 's safe to assume that if the dems take the senate and the white house they will nominate liberal judges and this will not differ between candidates .
executive orders will depend on the candidate with some likely to be more prone to use them than others as well as some may use more powerful ones .
foreign policy is tough to say because anybody but warren and bernie have pretty unknown foreign policy right now and these two arent exactly good in that regard .
this leads me to the main point of this post the main part of voting in the primary is going to be picking who does best in the general election not in policy .
i hate it just as much as you guys but good policy wont win us the election and the bad policy pushed by these candidates likely wont pass anyway .
in the end harris beto warren booker klobuchar and biden wont differ that much from each other in the white house so supporting one over the other in terms of policy matters little .
support the candidate who has the best chance of winning .
is there a reason why we ca n't get it and pc can ?

i dont know how to use ps to do this but i think the title is self explanatory .
indonesia has been playing with the question of the territorial rights of the former dutch colony known as netherlands new guinea '' for a decade .
we have resorted to the table and diplomatic meetings to resolve this dispute but so far nothing has come of it .
we have concluded that the only practical solution to this is a military solution which will get us favorable terms in the table but if it comes to a heated conflict between us and the dutch we will not back down .
the netherlands continues to be supported by their fellow imperialists the americans the british and the french .
we request further military aid https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/west_new_guinea_dispute indonesian-soviet_rapprochement and support from the soviet union to help us in our quest to liberate west irian from the dutch imperialists .
have n't had the chance to do a poem in a little while so i decided to write one after seeing this prompt .
i thought it was a very powerful concept when i first saw it and i 'm reasonably happy with the result .
as ever with poetry there 's a million and one things i could improve on but the concept is there and i think it 's solid .
rather than spend the massive to refill it i 'd like to make my own .
is anyone aware of any good resources for this ?
i tried it once with pg and vg and it was a bust .
there was a computer in a woodshop classroom at my high school with various animations of brightly colored heads showing up somewhere on the screen then something causing them to splatter like a paintball soon after a screen of text displayed something i was too far away to read it then a different animation played .
the year i saw it must have been either 2004 or 2005 but the computer was older than that at the time one of those all-in-one mac models .
i 'm fairly sure but not positive that it was n't an after dark module .

i use redfin because i like their user interface where other sites fail and one of the things i used most was the virtual tour external link '' link they used to have in the listing details section that would take you to a separate gallery even though usually it would be to the same images as their default just bigger .
the last few months i have not seen it ?
it was a great feature since it showed the slideshow but with bigger higher res clear pictures .
no doubt we 've all heard it after being told they can only afford to pay us half or less of our rate .

i feel like every time i play and i feel like i 'm doing poorly i still give so much gold upon death while still getting so little when i make what i think is a big kill '' .
many times i 've found myself with nothing but boots and one component for treads/tranqs finally managing to kill the enemy carry with phase boots and 2 wraith bands and only getting 150-200 gold but then dying to the enemy support and giving 350-400 .
even when the enemy support is doing better than me i still feel like i give a lot of gold to them .
it was also a different studio than the first two had .
game definetly had interesting parts but failed on so many levels unfortunately .
i loved the first 2 games and i never got bored .
i got bored so many times in this one excessive loading times while teleporting unlike the other games no gun fights the entire game almost so many skills to use on nobody .
such bad story writing there 's a huge gap between narrative and its barely anything just another religious villain nothing new being told or no risk involved hence a very boring game .
and dont get me started on the endless glitchy tutorial messages .
also unrealistic scenes for example where she is attacked in the back by a jaguar yet stands up the day after like nothing happened idk that bothered me .
i liked the new stealth system but barely anybody to use it on the only extra stuff to do is more tombs yay personally i liked the tombs in the first 2 alot more especially since most were optional and when extra stuff was added it was more co-op or multiplayer .
this game extra stuff was just lazy to the bone and the extra costumes are just recolors .
i would love it if there would be more games but not from this studio it felt like such a character change for lara and not many years have passed i want a proper ending .
edit i couldve written this better but to clarify shadow is a decent game with fun parts in it but comes nowhere near the quality of the first 2 .
that and barely being able to fight enemies i cant be the only one disappointed in that lol .
i really wish the developers will think about what made the first 2 games great if they 're gon na make the forth game .

can anyone share some insight as to the tax liability on these benefits ?
company claims the vehicle has a taxable benefit of 13,000 .
personal use is not guaranteed but not outright discouraged .
all maintenance insurance and fuel is paid by me .
and kilom√©trage is paid out at 0.55/km if i do n't choose either of the above option .
i 'm not sure what the implications are of each option .
i did some cursory google searching but the goc results i found are above my head .
specifically my preference is to use the vehicle allowance and drive a low cost of operation vehicle .
but does this represent a significant problem from a tax liability perspective ?
if my allowance is significantly more than my cost of ownership/operation will there be an issue with offsetting the tax liability from the allowance ?

let us assume for a second that the epic games store has better features than steam .
or would they stay on steam because its just more convenient for them to buy it on steam .
since steam is the biggest store out there they have an advantage on convenience that no other store has a chance of getting .
sure there will be some people like me who dont care and always go to the store that has the best deals and features but there are loads of people who will just stick to steam .
thats why imo no store can compete with steam without having exclusives .

if anyone wishes to use these or one of these stories for a youtube video or something please send me a message or whisper or whatever they 're called on here .
i have purposely written them in a way that might be easy to narrate .
this is just an account of my true experiences .
first of all i 'll start by saying that generally i 'm pretty skeptical of the paranormal and hauntings .
i do believe demons can possess and cause havoc but when it comes to ghosts and spirits that 's a different story .
be that as it may these are the things that have happened to me that might be called paranormal '' there 's two different instances .
the first is during my time a night time security guard and the second is a series of dreams .
unfortunately there is no big scary monster at the end or anything like that .
when i was working as a security guard i would often be the overnight guard .
probably because i was a young guy and could easily handle the sudden shifts in day or night .
being the overnight guard meant to patrol the property which included 7 buildings in total .
one of which was an old manor like house that once belonged to a prominent family in our city .
this house was spooky enough as it is but every once in a while during patrol the lamp in the front window would be on and i would have to enter the house to turn it off .
i always just wrote it off as the docents leaving it one after a tour .
but even during the day that house always had an unsettling feeling .
other times the alarm on the house would be tripped and i would have to go and investigate .
every time this happened i would n't find anything inside and all the entryways were closed and locked .
a faulty sensor or a gust of wind hitting the windows just enough to move the sensor .
the main gallery was where i was stationed when i was n't on patrol .
the building had a main lobby where guests came in and paid their tickets a gift shop and the gallery itself .
the gallery was a descending spiral that went down below the lobby and had multiple levels .
i would sit in the lobby and use the big television they had to play a loop of upcoming events and gallery previews to watch batman beyond or dexter in between patrols .
in hindsight it was probably a bad decision to watch dexter because there was a big open window to the street outside and not everything in that show is exactly savory for work .
one day as i reentered the lobby from a patrol the show which had been on pause was already playing .
i immediately checked the doors to make sure they were indeed locked .
the only one that was n't was the one i had just unlocked to let myself in .
however i heard a noise coming from the main gallery .
and this is the only door to the gallery .
i looked over the rail and saw a dull but steady light glowing from one of the corridors at the bottom .
now the particular exhibit that was being featured in the gallery at the time was a rock and roll exhibit .
there were pictures of rock stars in front of huge crowds and in the studio some big blown up versions of album covers and there were a few tvs that played music videos on loop to show off the artistic nature of music videos .
as i made my way down the ramp i could begin to hear that the light was coming from one of those tvs and the video was playing .
so as i reached the bottom i shut off the tv and found myself in the pitch darkness of the gallery .
the air was cold and i had that uneasy feeling that i get in the other building .
i quickly ascended the ramp and out of the gallery .
as i exited the gallery and was locking it back up from the front door of the lobby came a loud noise as if someone had slammed the door .
but that was n't exactly possible because the doors have those pressurized arms to prevent slamming or any kind of fast closing in general .
when i looked over to it there was no one there and i would have seen them because as i mentioned there was a big open window i would 've been able to see them easily .
i shook it off and decided to just go back to my show .
i rewound the bit that had been playing on patrol and continued to watch .
a while later as i was getting up to patrol again there suddenly came a loud crash from the gift shop .
i took my flashlight and shined it through the security gate to look inside .
there was n't anything i could see but there came another crash as if an entire shelf of merchandise was knocked over .
after that i decided i was gon na sit in the guard room the rest of the night .
the next day i talked to my boss and went to apologize for the mess in the gift shop and that i would 've cleaned it up if i had the code to the security gate only the guy that ran the shop had the code he trusted no one else .
my boss just looked at me confused and said nothing was knocked over or out of place .
the other incident is a series of dreams i had in the week leading up to the birth of my daughter .
i 'm not sure what these dreams were but they scared the crap out of me .
they all started the same way my wife and hanging out in our bedroom and suddenly my wife says she has to go to the bathroom .
so she leaves and about a minute later she calls for me and i get up to go see .
our bathroom was directly across from our bedroom so from the door frame i could see her in the bathroom looking absolutely horrified in my direction .
i ask her what 's wrong and she only points to the hallway .
i walk outside the door and suddenly the air feels extremely dense and enclosing .
the darkness that is in the hallway is definitely much darker than normal .
i have no idea what it is but i can absolutely feel a dark malign presence all around me .
i try to call to my wife but there is no sound in the dense air .
after that i wake up in a small panic look around the room and realize it was a dream .
the day before my daughter was born the dream started off the same as before .
but this time during the minute between my wife leaving and her calling me i looked up and saw a lion staring over me from our vent system .
it looked me in the eye and continued to crawl through the vent .
i was a bit confused at first but then the dream continued as normal my wife calling me and i walk out of the room and into the dense air .
it took nearly 12 hours of labor and was well in the evening when she finally came .
that night in the hospital however i had another dream .
this time we were all in the living room my wife my daughter my parents and myself .
we were all there and suddenly i felt that dense air again emanating from the hallway .
i looked at it and it was pitch black .
it took a moment but i suddenly felt the presence tackle me to the ground with extreme force .
everyone around me just stared at me in disbelief as this shadow figure sat on top of me chocking me .
i felt a small feeling of rage and woke up .
however upon waking i found that i could n't move or breathe very well and it took only a couple second before it relented and i shot up gasping .
i told my wife about them and she thinks maybe something was trying to get to me .
we are a religious family so when i explained the one dream with the lion she think maybe it was god trying to protect me .
like i said i 'm a skeptic when it comes to paranormal things so i 'm not sure what to make of them .
let me know what you think they were or if they can be explained away .
my wife is now 8 months pregnant with our second daughter and i 'm seriously hoping those dreams do n't come back .
i just seen a divine seven ... like what .
looking for a well hung furry to pound my elf pussy lol .
i love to be spanked have my hair pulled and fucked roughly .
i love taking it up my ass as well i 'm kinda a slut lol .
she has been going to meetings nearly daily and na conventions here and there spending time with na people chairing meetings driving people to and from meetings .
she also works 3rd shift by choice and we have a 3 and 10 year old .
she is hardly around and does n't have much time to spend with the kids .
over the summer she spent every other weekend working and then the other weekends going to music shows out of town .
she seems more emotionally attached and open to her na folks guys and girls than me .
i ca n't get her to commit to skipping 2 meetings per week reliably on between mon tues and thurs .
our daughter has ferocious adhd and has trouble getting her homework done .
they deserve way more one on one time and i feel so bad for my daughter because the 3 year old ends up getting more attention .
meanwhile i have to keep nagging on her to remember to pay her share of daycare or make her car payment which keeps drafting out of our joint checking for the lights and mortgage .
she spent so much money over summer on shows snacks at gas stations cigs and vape stuff that she kept coming short contributribing to joint bills .
she was away at rehab for 4 months last year and my daughter tells me that it still feels like she 's there .
and lastly i have a terrible sciatic pain which i ca n't seem to heal from because i can never get a break .
i understand that she has got to take care of her that if she gets back on drugs she is no good to anyone and likely to end up dying .
but i feel like it 's also escapism get on easierr 3rd shift i 've done the math the extra pay is consumed by cigarettes and daily gas station mountain dews hang out with meeting folk for an hour before and after meetings smoking and chatting goikg to na events ... do n't have to be at home and deal with the kids .
they do n't want to play with me/i 'm not good at playing with our daughter '' .
.shes absolutely ruled out marriage counciling until some vague point in the future when she is ready .
i 've wanted counciling since before we got married got married 4 years ago when our daughter was 6 .
i do n't even know if i even want marriage counciling anymore .
there has n't been anything positive or anything that makes me happy in this marriage in the last 3 years .
sometimes i fantasize about being a single dad who actually gets a couple weekends a month to myself .
and then maybe i could catch my breath and really carry the weight of two parents better than i am .
i make it to al-anon maybe 2-3 times a month i 'd go 2x per week if not for her schedule am part of an al-anon text group and have a network of co-workers who are basically like an unofficial al-anon group .
am i the only one that feels like dice should make a report system in battlefield v kinda like overwatchs or cs go 's ?
i know reporting can be done through origin but its more convinient in-game and i think more people would actually report the cheaters hence the easier accessibility

this is all the information i can remember about the game
i think the videos thumbnail was white with the spirit girls face on it but im not sure .
so markiplier played this horror game some time ago .
he had gotten to i think part 5 of the series before taking a year long break .
when the game starts you 're greeted by a pitch black ghost i believe and she tells you how to free your soul .
you have to to through some puzzle rooms in order to get your life back .
i believe you find other spirits throughout the game .
the game ended with you finding out that you are the offspring of your mother and your uncle .
your uncle raped your mother or something along the lines of that .
your father was never around and i think the uncle got jealous .
the spirits you ended up finding along the way turned out to be your family and they all bascially forgave each other or something along the lines of that .
i 've been noticing a trend lately of comedies starring women that heavily rely on some sort of magical element to drive the plot forward .
last time i went to the theater i saw trailers with three different movies that were like this !
is n't it romantic '' a woman gets hit in the head to wake up finding herself living in a pg-13 romantic comedy .
little '' a woman gets a spell put on her and wakes up as a little girl .
what men want '' a woman gets a spell put on her and gets hit in the head to wake up being able to read men 's thoughts .
on top of all this those last two movies were written by the same women !
edit i just wanted to add that i do n't there 's anything wrong with this .
i just seems a bit lazy that this is the trend .
some might say that this is what sells but i guarantee you all three of these movies will flop .
i understand that in today 's climate a lot of filmmakers want to get things of their chest which is great but it seems like this sort of gimmick might just be the easiest way to do it .
women do n't need the aid of magic to propel their stories forward .
change your life in 7 days ‚Äì invite the future you into the now
upon this road unto self there comes that time where knowing alone is not enough anymore and then comes the great surprize .
not until that moment that the door of feeling within opens up to you has one any idea what it is that one has been holding out for .
understanding our oneness of be-ing is one thing when one 's original nature opens up to oneself one 's whole life gets turned upside down as one struggles to come to grips with one 's amazing original self .
there is nothing that can prepare one for the graceful truthfulness of one 's original nature that is child-like in be-ing .
several things become instantaneously clear this original nature of one 's be-ing can not hurt it is not possible at all for a love of this deep and graceful nature to hurt .
this nature does not know negativity is absolutely positive in expression knows not the idea of can not as unto this self all is possible this due to the very positive-ness of outlook .
this self is absolute child-like and within this child-like gracious self is vested all the power within the universe .
there exist no real words to describe what i am trying to convey to you as the mind can not define this nature .
the only way possible that original nature can be made clear is to feel it the actual feeling of it only then will you truly understand that which you are .
i first came across our original nature when a well known brother of ours one night performed a healing on me .
what i saw before me was a man of around 35 years old what came across in his communication with me was a young man of around 21 years old with the most gentle graceful and softness of natures possible .
what my eyes saw and the reality that confronted me was 2 totally different things .
i then wandered about this great difference for days .
the idea i think man has of what must be great and loving and powerful and godlike and the truth that stood before me was 2 totally different things .
it is true in saying to you that the universe is guided by an absolute intelligence of absolute graceful child-like innocent and absolute benevolent nature .
in all my posts i could only tell you what i personally found to be true based upon my own experience and the same applies here .
it is my hope that the exercise i have created for myself will do for you what it has done for me .
the basis of this exercise is the real and truthful which we are to invite this self into the here and now through feeling and understanding .
will note no capitals are used to self only self exists there is no higher nor lower only self .
self is all that is as only self exists .
we are all parts of the whole we stepped out of the whole into individualized creative consciousness‚Äòs of self we have within ourselves one part of each of those particles within self that together constitutes complete self-consciousness .
through this one of each we are representative of the whole and thus is the whole of i consciousness as we are linked to the whole of i consciousness through be-ing one complete infinite consciousness particle of self .
having said this we are the consciousness of the universe and all within .
our original and safeguarded innocent child-like nature is one of being infinitely soft and gentle infinitely loving infinitely graceful infinitely benevolent totally positive of be-ing .
some time ago i did an extract from life and teachings on the exercise of becoming born again and earlier i also posted the link to the ho'oponopono healing exercise .
since our original nature opened to me i understood simple things much clearer and i have made a combination of these two exercises that has changed my life in profound ways .
i have a spot where i stand bare feet on lawn is best and face eastwards towards.. the gate through which universal energies enter earth .
i start by saying i love this which i am .
‚Äì holding in mind and feeling this soft gentleness of my be-ing feeling the gracefulness that i am feeling this beautiful love i am .
this which you now say unto yourself is what you are not maybe is period .
this is the true you that personality will merge back into over time .
2 i say unto myself i accept that all the imperfection i see within this world is but a projection from within myself outwards and i accept that the error lies wholly within me in the way i think in the way i act .
i am sorry i am so sorry so deeply sorry for creating this error within myself .
feeling deeply and genuinely this admission of my error unto myself .
3 in my mind i gather these knots of energy from within myself of erroneous thinking and acting and i lay them at the feet of the fatherhood of my be-ing that great aqueous source from where within all originates and i surrender these unto my father .
i see my father bend down and one by one to undo the rope-like knots of energy and then place the clear ropes of energy back into the crystal clear aqueous ocean .
4 i thank myself for the soft graciousness of my be-ing of being able to forgive myself for these errors committed and i draw back from source the energy surrendered unto now crystal clear and beautiful .
i weave into this energy this soft and gentle love that i am .
5 i thank myself for this gracefulness of my be-ing for this great gentleness that i am which allows me to gracefully forgive myself .
i look at this love that i am in gratitude at its gracefulness and thank myself for becoming reborn and renewed unto myself for being this soft gracious unto myself .
during the day i over and over say unto myself with feeling i love myself i love my original self i am sorry so sorry .
i thank myself with depth of feeling for this graciousness of my being of being able to forgive myself over and over and over .
over and over i draw unto myself this soft gentle graceful love that i truly am .
the more i do this the more the ever presence of this love unfolds within me unto my consciousness .
i have no words to explain how this truthful me draws closer and closer unto me .
all i can say is that it opens another world where love is universal in all and through all links all .
may this be of help unto you may this be .
do this over and over with deep sincerity day in and day out for 7 days and see if your life does not take a dramatic turn for the good .
they do n't seem raid viable from what i 've seen .
but that 's just been from a video or two i 've watched on the updated team .
the top 100 teams in my arena are all defenders teams .
every last one of them except one guy with a bh team .
i know they can manage as a blitz option but just curious about arena .
i 've heard people suggest thanos and nn to make them raid viable replacing drax and groot .
or even a tech hybrid team with rr sl vision nn and thanos .
i do n't have thanos yet tho i 'm around 86/100 to unlock him .
point is i 'm so sick of using defenders for everything and seeing them everywhere in the game and i 'm looking for some other options .
i have cap bw quake and vision as options to work on they 're all 4 around 11k each so that 'll take some time .
homegirl is determined to be culturally enlightened i did n't really see it coming but i 'm not surprised at all .
so as the title says i was swallowing 2 capsules of a vitamin at the same timew with little water and minutes later i felt them stuck .
i went to get more water as this has happened before in the past but this time the chest pain still persists and it hurts when swallowing .
i also burp a lot and it is exacerbated by citrus or acidic like foods .
i also have always had acid reflux with lots of different kinds of foods but never this .
i am concerned that that might affect it too .
so i 've been thinking about making a character who 's primary function is buffing allies .
i really like the look of foresight and haste .
from what i gather the only options to get foresight are bard druid warlock wizard cleric arcana .
so i 'll start with my big and broad question
what are the best buffing support spells in 5e ?
i 've mentioned foresight and haste but i have n't been able to read through them all .
i 'm just hoping more experienced people can give me some insight into this line of thinking .
i 'm currently at the end of act 2 and overall the game is really good compared to the first one .
i do feel there is a big diference from the first one and that is that i feel that i constantly have to look up wiki 's or make scum saves to solve quests the most optimal way .
in the first game it felt more natural to just go with the flow whereas in this game there is so goddamn many secrets and missable quest endings that euqals potential loss in exp gear etc .
i have terrible memory terrible but have been journaling my dreams lately just because i know analysis can make a world of difference in the significance of dream symbolism sometimes .
lately for the past week or so i 've been having dreams about being in my parent 's home country particularly remembering either being in the village or being with people from the village elders and such .
it might be worth noting that in my country of heritage your village is a very significant place and what village you 're from has more importance in your identity than your last name as with western culture .
anyways it 's strange to me that i keep having dreams about my village/people bc i had n't been thinking about them at all until now obviously .
now it struck all but curiosity out of me but this is where i 'm scared and need advice my mother 's family has a sort of ‚Äòcurse ' that she would always speak of .
she passed away before 50 and so did many of her siblings one after the other almost like a domino effect all at a young age of strange or unexpected/immediate circumstances .
she passed away after we visited her village for a family reunion which is what my mum 's family attributes to the reasoning behind her and her sibling 's death following the trip our village is renowned for witchcraft and she had always recounted strange supernatural events happening to the family because her father/family was very well respected and highly regarded in town .
my mother always reassured me this curse was n't generational and i would be safe .
basically all the previous dreams had been about my dad 's village/people .
it 's strange to me to let alone be dreaming of my village when i 'm preoccupied with life here i just woke up from a dream i was in a parked car with my uncle who is alive and lives in my same city in the driver and my mum in the front passenger seat i 'm behind the driver seat my uncle asks me when i plan on going back to visit the village in real life he would never ask this because of everything that happened and i would never dream of going back .
i told him i was thinking possibly next year .
i 've heard many stories of people saying they dream of their deceased loved ones calling them to follow them or calling them back somewhere almost as if calling them to death .
i 've had some prophetic-like dreams before not to the extent of life and death just seeing places i 'd seen in dreams before etc so this is a bit scary for me .
i think it might be worth mentioning as well that i 've been having many apocalyptic dreams but one specific one in particular we all knew we had a certain amount of time before the world ended and i absolutely insisted i be in my dad 's village i was bare naked there so i could ‚Äòfeel raw ' came out the womb naked going back out naked ?
i wanted to feel as connected to the land i was from as possible like i said where you come from is so important before we all ‚Äòwent ' .
also might be worth mentioning my mum has been in quite a few of my dreams past one-two weeks as well .
i went to my first group therapy session today .
i got way way more anxious than anticipated when i got there .
i rarely do things this uncomfortable so i have n't felt that intense anxiety in a while which could be why i thought it was n't going to be that bad .
i did n't say much more than my name and age but it was my first time there and i was super nervous .
my neck hurts from looking at the floor for so long i did n't look anyone in the face .
i do n't know i just wanted to ask if anyone here currently go to group therapy or have been and what it 's like for you ?
it was very interesting spite my anxiety being high and i 'm really exhausted now .
voice breaking legs shaking stomach twisting and lots of sweat but i did n't think too much about it in that setting as in if anyone noticing and judging me for it .
everyone there had social anxiety avpd problems and some of them were very clearly having much anxiety during the session too but they still talked so i was n't so bothered as usual that my body was giving me the bad feels .
i should say this was n't some random therapy group for any mental illness it was for personality disorders which made me feel more comfortable there would probably be others with avpd there and relatable problems .
i felt a bit crazy for saying yes to go there since it was only yesterday i was asked when i wanted to go and i could already today so everything happened faster than expected .
group therapy always sounded terrifying to me i 've gotten much better at winning over my anxiety the last year and felt i could do this now and even tricked myself into thinking it 's no big deal but i was absolutely dying just waiting for my turn at introductions and it went so slow torture really .
but felt exhilarating when it was over and i did okay .
btw unrelated but on the way home i went off the tram so the woman sitting next to me could get off easier and she gave me a big smile lost my seat but small stuff like that really makes my day .
i do n't think i smiled back tho my brain was n't ready thanks for reading
i recently got back in to the game can i buy the dlc alone i do n't really want to buy it in a bundle when i already own all the other dlcs
ive been out of the game for a little bit and finally had a game of 8th edition last week .
i played my normal list of necrons which consist of a lord warriors destroyers and a monolith .
but i noticed now the monoliths suck compared to the days of old .
so the question is i wan na change it all up maybe and make a new 2000pts list .
any help be great i heard wraths are better now and maybe c'tans ?

hello everyone i 'm reaching out today because i can not figure out port forwarding to fix this lag on my xbox .
i have spectrum 400 and when i play wired on my modem which is a arris tm1602a everything works fine it has open nat and speeds and performance are incredible .
but when i plug it in to my router a sagecom rac2v1k everything does a 180 .
strict nat upnp not successful and i lag lag lag like crazy .
there is a huge difference but i cant jack the modem and my family 's internet 247 .
im gon na post some pictures on what i see when i try to port forward .
the window and details of my portfowarding settings in router .
i know it probably wo n't happen but man would it be cool af .
there are elements of the souls games that would fit with each faction so no faction would feel too left out .
you could have some awesome dark souls themed armor and weapons like how cool would it be to have a solaire themed armor and weapon set for vortiger or warden ?
we could have some dark souls themed minions in 4s and maybe reskin the commanders in breach as dark souls bosses ?
dark souls music in matches or in the menus ?
it likely would n't be that much harder to do than the current assassin 's creed themed event ...
again this unlikely to happen but it would be the coolest .
edit for those who do n't seem to understand ...
this is fluff as it was marked ... it 's not meant to be taken seriously ... yes i know ubi owns ac and not dark souls ... y'all need to loosen up before you have a stroke .
i 've had my current build for a few months now and could n't be happier .
i 'm gaming pretty reliably on ultra at minimum 60 fps even on something like witcher 3 .
everything 's being cooled using five fans three on the sides two on the top and i even swapped out the default case fans for corsairs .
a friend asked me if i have plans to do liquid cooling i have an nzxt kraken x62 and suggested that it 's helpful for keeping the cpu or gpu at a consistent temperature and told me how easy it is to set up and so on .
i 'm skeptical since even with settings jacked up to ultra and framerates unlocked my core temps have never been going past 60c .
so is there any practical reason to do liquid cooling at all ?
while it looks like it might be fun to try i 'm leery of having liquids around sensitive electronics .
i have had a nano big muff a soul food and a ditto looper for quite a while and have recently got a canyon delay and the oceans 11 reverb .
my question is which order should i put them all in ?
i am still new to pedals and am not really sure .
i have played them all individually and got some nice sounds but putting them all together gets muddy really quick .
i am just a bedroom player who has mainly stuck to acoustic but have decided to branch out this year .
i am playing through an orange micro terror and my guitar is an epiphone riviera p93 if that makes any difference .
we are about halfway through the long reread of the manga .
participation has been fairly low but that is to be expected especially since we have a very tiny subreddit .
however the reread has been successful in producing a stream of content that hopefully is welcome in our subscribers ' feeds .
moving forward i am reaching out to see if there is anything more that the community would like in terms of improving the reread or improving content in the sub generally .
thank you to everyone has participated in the last year and a half !
chapter 113 pretty much confirms that zeke is definitely not manipulating or controlling eren .
he appears to believe that only he and eren truly understand what 's going on https i.imgur.com/xono0jf.jpg .
ignoring their short encounter in shiganshina the two of them only first met 2 months ago .
why is it that these two brothers have so much faith in each other ?
zeke 's entire plan hinged on eren coming to marley and taking part in the plan to attack the festival .
he 's the type of person to never leave things to chance if he can help it and convincing someone who has every reason to see him as an enemy to abandon his friends and leave to go undercover in enemy territory is a pretty tall order .
i feel that zeke needed to have something up his sleeve in order to be confident that he could get eren trust him enough to take such huge risks .
if we go back to chapter 68 when historia dealt the finishing blow to rod 's titan she saw some flashes of rod 's memories https imgur.com/a/hdccjpo .
what if the reason for this is because she came into contact with some of his titan 's spinal fluid ?
historia a direct descendant of ymir fritz the founding titan gained some fragments of the memories of a titan with royal blood after coming into contact with their spinal fluid .
assuming this is true what could be said about the wielder of the founding titan coming into contact with the spinal fluid of a titan with royal blood ?
i think it would be interesting if during the railroad opening ceremony that everyone seems to keep bring up for some reason eren was purposefully served wine that had some of zeke 's spinal fluid and this triggered him to gain some if not all of zeke 's memories .
perhaps he saw something that made him feel like he could/should trust zeke like something involving eren kruger and/or xavier .
this would explain something that has been bothering me for some time now .
we saw that 1 year ago eren acted pretty much like the same person we 've known all these years https imgur.com/a/gdr7zsi .
this was when they were near completion of the rail system .
but then during the rail opening ceremony 10 months ago when eren went to talk with yelena his demeanor is completely different .
he looks much more like the eren we have seen throughout the marley arc and beyond https imgur.com/a/howwxch .
but there was n't nearly enough time between those two moments for such a drastic change to take place organically .
something had to trigger it and i think the wine is the answer .
lastly there was a fan q a session with isayama back in march of last year .
besides now standing at 183cm eren is also a heavyweight drinker does n't get drunk easily and good at cleaning .
he is now influenced by a lot of the memories he retained and he determinedly chopped off his own leg before entering marley .
his irises are a grey-ish color and his bloodtype is b .
also his song genre of choice at karaoke would be metal .
it may be a bit of a stretch but i think isayama mentioning the fact that eren can hold his alcohol could have been a small hint towards eren drinking the marleyan wine .
he also talks about eren being influenced by memories but he never said they were only memories from his predecessors .
i think this perfectly explains why zeke and eren are able to trust each other .
they have seen things that no one else is able to see .
this gives more weight to u/qrowin-shitposts theory about them wanting to use the founding titan to show the rest of the eldian 's their memories https www.reddit.com/r/shingekinokyojin/comments/a9bwhn/manga_spoilersi_fucking_figured_out_what_erens .
it 's a drawing based in social media or the idea of video chatting ?
the image shows a girl in her room chatting with someone from her laptop and everything in the background looks nice and perfect but everything outside of the camera 's view is n't clean or appropriate ?
i 'm trying to show this image to my students as an example of people who fake their identities online .
any other cool memes or images relating to this topic would be greatly appreciated !
i 'm building an ash handrail and all is going well except one part .

my company is funded by the ma department of mental health .
residents in my group home vary in independence and some are unable to wipe themselves after going to the bathroom and often accidentally urinate around the house .
as counselors we are not allowed to help with direct care we can only prompt them to change and shower but are forced to constantly clean urine and feces because we do not have a designated cleaner/cna in the house .
these residents also leave urine on whatever furniture they sit on .
we also had an incident where a resident developed infected rashes that oozed pus yet was allowed to return from the hospital hospital advised against it and use furniture in the house .
the house is unsanitary and constantly smells awful so it 's biohazardous for everyone living/working .
i often see people saying that liz thinks she is the better actor than spader and that she thinks red does n't know she betrayed him .
therefore i 'm curious does spader know from the script he got betrayed by liz or do they hide it from each other so that emotions ca n't be involved .
this may be a stupid question as i am not really familiar with the tv networks ...

i 'm getting off adt after 10 years and i decided on going with abode home security .
well this is for my mother 's house so i wanted to set her up a gui interface so she could control the alarm with a gui on the wall by the door instead of using the phone all the time .
plus i have to get rid of the old control box on the wall so i was thinking of going with action tiles and mounting a fire tablet on the wall in place of it .
so my question is does anyone know how to tie abode into smartthings .
i saw a post on the action tiles forums link https support.actiontiles.com/communities/12/topics/1433-show-me-your-panels-gallery-1 comment-13220 where a guy had his wall panel set up with exactly what i want to do but he did n't elaborate on how he did it .
so if anyone could lead me in the right direction that would be awesome .

my wife has been watching korean drama shows subtitles and all for about 2 months now .

it was super hard for me to make friends but in 4th grade i had a best friend .
then one day i think i was showing her a lewd gesture that i must have saw in a movie the v '' fingers in front of your mouth while you waggled your tongue and her mom saw and that was the end of our friendship ...
the thing was i was a great kid super sweet i didnt even start swearing until college .
i had no idea what that meant and instead of taking me aside and explaining to me that i was doing something bad she just made her daughter stop being my friend .
i was alone for 2 more years before i made a new group of friends .
i have a question for those of you who have your gay apps wether is scruff grindr or whatever you 're on to your facebook or instagram ?

we finally have most of the 2018 election cycle in the rear-view mirror outside of poor poor dan mccready .
to help kill time before the 2019 general i thought i 'd start writing summaries of how democratic bench situation in each republican-held congressional district i 'll be doing a more in-depth dive in arizona including dem .
districts and possible 2020/2022 scenarios so we 'll skip that for the time being ‚Äì but i 'm still going to try to get it done before filing starts in earnest so it wo n't only be after wyoming .
the candidates here are n't all going to be running for congress in 2020 hell it 's somewhat likely that none of them do so .
democratic congressional candidates are much more than just highest ranking democratic politician in that district '' they 're veterans doctors teachers activists scientists businesspeople lawyers and celebrities who have never held public office .
but only one aspect of the bench can easily be googled and tallied up as a measure of party success and that 's people who 've held public office in the past .
so i 've tried to collect a list here .
it 's not all encompassing freshmen backbenchers and most school board members are kept off to save space and lord knows there 're a whole bunch of judges who could run .
i do pull from state house hd state senate sd county council ccd city council cicd and occasional school board sb as well as famous past and current statewides .
in some extremely rural areas i pull from some countywides .
list by and large has not been culled for past scandals outside of headline-news-worthy stuff .
analysis arkansas 's districts despite their pvi 's were actually drawn by a democratic legislature and signed into law by a democratic governor .
but it was n't sufficient enough to trump the changing sentiments of its residents and it has stayed solidly red since the 2010 election .
straddling the whole length of arkansas 's portion of the mississippi ar-1 incorporates historically african american communities near the mississippi river delta with more whiter and conservative areas inland .
the district 's recent pivot towards republican candidates has led to a relatively thin democratic bench .
mark mcelroy an outgoing 3-term representative immediately attracts some attention .
a relative moderate mcelroy was primaried out this cycle by incoming dem .
mcelroy filed to run as an independent in the general and ended up taking 2nd in the election 44 d 30.4 i 25.5 r .
this was in a district that was only 48.3 black and against a black democratic candidate demonstrating abnormally strong support with crossover white voters .
if mcelroy runs as an independent again he might stand a chance at making ar-1 vaguely competitive .
another name that obviously stands out is former u.s .
senator blanche lincoln who represented the district back in the late clinton/early bush administrations .
now in her late 50 's and working in a nova consulting firm lincoln has frayed her ties with eastern arkansas somewhat ‚Äì but was the last dem who represented the district who could feasibly run for re-election .
if she ever does decide to make a comeback she could pack a punch .
robert marion berry held the seat after lincoln but is 76 years old .
keith ingram is the last of the major candidates on the list .
current senate minority leader he has mulled potential gubernatorial runs in the past and may think that he has the infrastructure he needs to take a shot at a seat above his current standing .
with berry nearing 80 lincoln in virginia and mcelroy probably soured at the state party ingram may be the most realistic recruit .
the other elected legislative candidates in the seat are of no particular note ‚Äì each relatively new to the state capitol and probably unwilling and unable to make a hop to a larger seat with even a modicum of success .
monte hodges probably is the most notable of these four ‚Äì he won a contested election in 2018 in a seat that only has a small black majority ‚Äì which could prove some ability to attract independents .
clarke tucker hd-35 outgoing 3 term representative candidate in 2018
analysis ar-02 is currently thee bluest of the congressional districts in arkansas by virtue of encompassing most of the little rock metropolitan area .
because of this it also is home to most former democratic statewide candidates including former governor mike beebe lieutenant governor bill halter and senator mark pryor .
it had a very good shot at flipping this cycle thanks to the strong campaign of state rep. clarke tucker .
beebe pryor and halter are all strong former candidates but most likely will not run in 2020 ‚Äì possibly only for higher office i.e .
halter may be young enough to sustain another run relative to pryor and beebe but having not won an election in 12 years losing a primary against lincoln in 2010 it 's doubtful he wants to jump into the fray again .
ross is in a similar boat ‚Äì he held ar-04 for 12 years but was drawn into ar-02 during redistricting .
with little past history with most communities in ar-02 and with a gubernatorial loss in his background it 's highly unlikely he runs again .
but his ability to win in some rural communities plus the strong urban base in little rock allows for the potential to make a race competitive .
he ran a strong campaign and has really recent infrastructure still in place in the district .
re-matches do n't always have the highest of ceilings but also have higher-than normal floors .
he 'd definitely keep it a competitive seat although it 's unknown if he 'd be able to put the race over the finish line .
a former republican justice of the peace he switched to run as a democrat in 2014 for state house and has been a moderate dem .
he represents a rather exurban portion of the little rock metro area and could potentially win some less-urban votes due to his tested ability to win in his current district .
as with ar-1 the other legislative candidates are rather milquetoast .
however given the vast relative concentration of democratic power in this district there 're a lot of potential candidates to chose from to recruit .
analysis try as i might i could n't find any statewide from ar-3 a relatively compact seat in the nw of arkansas centered around fayetteville .
it 's the reddest district in the state and therefore has a thinner bench and fewer blue legislative districts than other arkansas congressional districts .
representatives denise garner and megan godfrey both won tight races against incumbents in red districts ‚Äì garner gaining 14 points on the 2014 democrat the seat went uncontested in 2016 and godfrey gaining 6 points on the 2016 democrat in her seat .
both incumbents were relatively milquetoast and did n't face any scandals of note .
while garner and godfrey are newcomers to the political sphere one may be willing to move to a higher seat at some point and they 've proven themselves in battle already .
incoming senator greg leding is one of the more senior dems in the area having spent 4 terms as a representative in a district consisting of most of fayetteville 's urban core .
while he does n't have the suburban/rural winning creds that the two freshman representatives have he 's had multiple years of legislating experience under his belt .
uvalde lindsey the senator whose seat leding is taking over is also a decent option albeit rather old .
there are some other potential candidates ‚Äì whitaker and mcgill for starters ‚Äì but they do n't seem to be set to perform above the standard partisan lean of the district .
analysis arkansas 's 4th hugs the southwest portion of the state although it protrudes quite far north ‚Äì almost to the missouri border ‚Äì and east ‚Äì to the mississippi river delta .
mike ross held this seat in the 2000 's but was drawn into ar-2 .
bench here is rather discombobulated with both few statewide and legislative options to pull from .
nate steel is the top option in this district a former nominee for attorney general in 2014 .
steel performed admirably well outperforming mike ross and all other statewide candidates although still only getting 43 .
still relatively young and with a decent enough statewide performance under his belt steel could be a good option for recruitment in this seat .
leanne burch is a noticeably moderate representative who was appointed to her seat after the death of sheila lampkin .
the seat was relatively competitive under lampkin ‚Äì with republicans getting into the low 40 's in two consecutive elections ‚Äì but burch has managed to scare away challengers running unopposed both in her special election and in the 2018 general election .
a former brigadier general and attorney burch has a strong background outside of politics that makes her and interesting candidate for a higher seat .
james lee witt the 2014 democratic candidate for the seat performed surprisingly well just like steel for a gop wave year ‚Äì scoring just 1 percentage point lower than pat hays di din the much bluer ar-2 .
while witt has this strong performance in his background he 's also 75 years old and is probably not willing to come back into politics at this point .
the remaining candidate are all legislators that have managed to hang on in a very red district with no town larger than 50,000 people .
most districts are close to the mississippi river delta relying on black votes to keep the seats competitive .
lawrence teague and bruce maloch buck the trend representing districts near the texas/louisiana border .
both have held their seats for quite some time and have proven themselves capable of winning in rural areas .

just remove all player blips from radar and map .
have people engage in the tracking view and be able to see trails of players that have their names associated with those trails .
then the player can follow the trail to find where the player went this would make it so the hunter would have to actually use some effort in hunting someone down .
this keeps people safe by being off radar but allows pvp'ers to hunter others down by tracking them like an animal .
eventually sneaking up on them when they dont even know it .
it keeps the fun of hunting someone else down there but also makes the world safe from griefersby removing everyone 's blip from the entire world .
obviously if you are in a posse show those blips on the map at all times .
it got lambasted by the critics when it was released but it definitely has charm and character .
a crazy premise with your main character being immortal and able to roll and jump around with only his head !
it also has one of the funniest character designs ever in the form of sangria .

you will not do things the way we do them here today where everyone does whatever in his own opinion seems right ... deuteronomy 12:8
starting from verse 8 we are introduced to yet another fundamental torah principle .
it is god not man who authorizes how he is to be worshipped .
so what is the proper worship of god supposed to consist of ?
simple his ordained ceremonies are to be carried out in his ordained ways at his appointed times .
we 're talking about the biblical festivals here folks .
at this point i 'm well aware that the vast majority of the gentile church will respond with a bored yawn and justify their lack of interest by saying look man .
i can worship the lord any way i want .
of course you 're not required to make a journey to a temple that does n't exist .
nor do you have to recite certain traditional prayers or have one distinct order of service .
and you 're not forced to worship the lord at a certain location .
however the torah makes it clear that there are certain specially designated dates and times and ways we are to keep ...
... and if we do n't keep them god makes it clear we are not worshiping him at all .
if we insist on doing things our own way we are no better off than some of those rebellious israelites who wrongly thought it was okay to do things the way their canaanite neighbors were doing them as long as they were paying homage to their god .
this is pretty much the way the vast majority of christendom thinks today .
remember god ordered the religion of the canaanites to be destroyed .
therefore if what god did in the past is any indicator of what may happen in the future i would say a healthy respect and fear for god and his clear instructions should take priority over our fleshly desires .
to this point i want to leave you with an interesting quote .
he is considered to be one of the most conservative bible scholars of our day .
he also happens to be the academic dean of trinity evangelical divinity school .
some believe his works have influenced the evangelical movement and its doctrines more than anyone on the planet today .
take a look at the below quote and pay special attention to those parts i bolded and underline dealing with the old testament and how he says its rules and regulations are still relevant to modern believer today .
i think you 're going to be quite surprised .
... ... in order to make up for the hiatus of instruction on all sorts of practical questions about how to deal with everyday problems such as ‚Äòyouth conflicts ' and the like evangelicals flock by the thousands in every major metropolitan area to special seminars as an open testimony to their hunger for true biblical instruction on matters that were actually dealt with in the ot law .
to be sure most of these seminars on youth problems marriage enrichment and business management techniques drew heavily on the biblical wisdom books of the ot especially proverbs ecclesiastes and the song of solomon .
but what few have realized and what still remains as one of the best kept secrets to this very day is that these same wisdom books have as their fountainhead the law of moses .
one need only take a marginally competent reference bible and notice how frequently the text of proverbs for example directly quotes or alludes to the books of exodus numbers and deuteronomy in its popularized bumper sticker way of theologizing .
just these few examples should be enough to warn the contemporary pastor and teacher .
we must overcome our inherited prejudice against the ot especially as concerns the law .
we must immediately move to balance the spiritual diet of god 's people .
few people today would espouse a junk-food nutritional plan as a regular plan of good eating but how many christians prefer to eat only the ‚Äòdesert ' as found in the nt ?
in order to address this imbalance ... ... .we must begin to use the ot in a more balanced and holistic teaching ministry.

the rumble card was revamped after christmas with the key change being plans for ronda rousey vs. charlotte flair getting changed to rousey vs. sasha banks a match that came out of nowhere on raw .
the back story is that as of right now as noted a few weeks ago the arguments to get flair into the wrestlemania rousey match were accepted by vince mcmahon .
the current plan is a three-way for the title with rousey vs .
the feeling was also to not compromise that match that rousey should n't face flair at the rumble .
we were also told that while that is the plan right now it is not locked in stone and there are still two ppvs between rumble and wrestlemania elimination chamber on 2/17 in houston and fast lane on 3/10 in cleveland that rousey vs .
flair could take place at if mcmahon changes his mind .
we pretty much ran down the key arguments made for adding flair and making it a three-way especially if it 's promoted as the first-ever women 's main event in mania history .
it will give both flair and lynch the distinction for the rest of their career as being part of the first which should elevate both and eventually make them legends of the industry .
it also should be a better match with flair involved .
regarding asuka vs lynch there is still talk of lynch being in the rumble after that match happens as a surprise entrant and winning the thing which would lead to her challenging rousey .
that 's not necessarily happening but it was one of the ways potentially to get to her in the match and then flair would get in the match another way .
flair could also win the rumble herself and then elimination chamber would determine who would challenge for the smackdown title .
lynch could also win the smackdown title and flair win the rumble although that would lead to only one women 's title match on the show .
there was also talk of crowning the first women 's tag team champions on mania but that also was just something talked about and not anything said to be definite . ''

so i 'm interviewing for a position as a digital marketing manager in a few weeks in a b2c company .
right now the company has little to no marketing and they 've asked me to help .
i 'm a video freelancer which means i 'm familiar with paid ads seo and everything content related but i 've never done it as my main job .
i 've been taking a few classes from the hubspot academy and it definitely helped a lot .
my question is should i prepare some kind of strategy or plan for the interview to show them i know what i am doing ?
any younger straight guys curious and wan na show off ?
a player on the opposite team on the rotterdam map just did this !

today my dear grandfather passed away peacefully in his sleep .
this was the first time i saw death up close and it 's making me question the meaning of life .
why does life stop the way it does when it does ?
i received my double phd ‚Äì i 'm one step closer to starting my own lab !
the pride on my parents ' faces today was priceless !
i 'm more determined than ever to unravel the key to immortality !
do n't know how long i have to save my parents from death .
more than 3 decades of work but it feels like we 're still barely scratching the surface .
we must be doing something right the government has decided to fund my project .
finally created an elixir that will extend the life of mammals !
we need to test it further before i can say anything more .
testing for the past couple of years have revealed that this elixir we 're calling it amruta does impart immortality to mice .
trials on humans commenced last year and have given us promising results .
consumption of 100ml of amruta will make the human immortal .
it 's funny actually ‚Äì the body continues to function even when deprived of food and water .
there is huge pressure on us to commercialise it .
we can now boast of a long client list .
eminent personalities and celebrities round the world have consumed our amruta .
but i see this creating a divide in the society .
one section living forever and becoming wealthier while the other getting bogged down due to loss and grief .
my aim now is to remove this inequality and make it reach everyone in this world !
no one should feel the pinch of loss of a loved one .
i 've succeeded in bringing amruta to everyone on this planet .
tomorrow will bring the dawn of a new era .
we we ‚Äì it never crossed any of our minds .
ok this is getting out of hand ‚Äì more and more people became reckless since they knew they could n't die .
we 've been getting reports of how people rammed their vehicles into each other just to ‚Äòtest amruta ' .
how some tried to hack their enemies to death .
now even though someone is nearly headless he um continues to live ?
i did n't want this this is not what i envisioned .
these people are everywhere mindlessly walking about as if nothing has happened .
worse some have attacked the healthy people out of spite !
my maid turned up with an eye missing today i could see the bloody empty socket !
and they have started pointing at me blaming me for their misery .
i ca n't even go out of my home now .
some who have lost their legs are dragging themselves by their hands .
others are attacking ones who are um normal can you call any of us normal ?
the story revolves around a member of the kamishiro 's side of a fellow student who seeks to have a threat to the city .
in order to save the world of the world of the earth federation agency dr .
parody garden and their dreams of the evil satoshi and his friends are searching for the sake of her attempt to transform into the presence of the organization the spirit of the kamishiro 's sister miko and misako are assigned to form his own apprenticeship and decides to uncover the planet .
it seems that not all the housework and her father is attacked by the strange realm and from shin become a super deformed son and her father .
the protagonist of the student council becomes long as her own destiny but also a surprise attack on the public town of the shinto sakuran sensei .
i really like the profile design aero bars but looking at it they do n't sell the t4 anymore .
i like that bend the most over the t2 .
what are the pro 's and cons to both bends .
any suggestions as to why i would use one over the other .
so i just wanted to share my struggles i was having just in case anyone else was going through this and could n't figure out what was wrong for the longest time like me .
lo is 2 months now and i was having problems with him being a little colicky and gassy .
after i took him to the pediatrician i was told to change my diet and figure out through process of elimination what food was making his tummy upset .
it was n't very hard to figure out it was dairy products so when i cut it out of my diet it improved but did n't completely fix the problem .
he seemed like he was always eating constantly pooping too .
and he would also struggle and get fussy while he was eating but screamed when i took the boob away .
after doing a little research i found that i was over producing milk so i had a large volume low fat feed that goes through the baby so quickly that not all the lactose is digested .
i basically had to switch from on demand to block-feedings .
so i had to switch boobs every 4 hours so the fat and milk supply builds up .
this happens when we oversupply and switch between breasts too soon and here are some symptoms i found online if you wanted to look out for it
a breastfed baby 's bowel motions can be liquid frothy or 'explosive ' shoot out with force and have a slightly offensive odor .
a formula-fed baby 's bowel motions tend to be sloppy and foul smelling .
baby gains large amounts of weight which is not the case when a baby is lactose intolerant .
baby is usually less than 3 months old but in some cases this problem can continue up to the age of 5-6 months .
the baby might also spit up or regurgitate milk not due to lactose overload but rather overfeeding which causes symptoms of lactose overload .
so my laptop had 8 gb ram for last couple of years .
when i had 50 chrome tabs open the laptop would normally choke and usage will be 95
so i added 8 more gigs but now even with 10-15 chrome tabs the usage with 10gb out of 16gb .
for example mitsutoki shigeta was aiming to have up to a 1000 babies but they stopped him and he did n't get to make that many .
i wonder if surrogate mothers give birth to more babies than the average woman .
as the title says the remote is n't completely destroyed the directional pad wo n't go to the right it registers an input as clicking the middle button .
forgot to mention i think i have a third or second hen apple tv i got it a very long time ago .
what are my options to get to settings so i can pair my iphone to my apple tv ?

has anyone experimented with adjusting the controls to feel like bfi ?
the default controls are way too sensitive especially when aiming .
do we get contacted when we get the answer right .
and do we get the answer by posting questions and/or by analysing feedback ?
or what should we do when we get the answer or we might understand what to do when we solve it .
this helps to explain the purpose of purity or one purpose .
when we are pure it 's a way of worshipping the creator rather than the created .
when we flip it around and idolize the created we have lost sight of the creator .

i 'm really losing my patience now because it 's not like it 's not turning on at all ... it is just not very often .
i do n't think it 's the psu as if it was it would n't turn on at all but i do n't know what it could be .
i do n't think it 's shorting on the case either and i made sure not to zap anything with static as well .
i 've got another psu i can try but it 's well cabled tied into my bitfenix prodigy and honestly i would really rather avoid taking the whole thing apart unless i absolutely need to as it took me hours to do in the first place .

i 've tried installing arch but after the installation is done the disk is not recoginzed as uefi and if i try to boot in legacy mode arch simply wo n't start i 've dug around and discovered that it 's something related to the fact i 've used grub as a bootloader that does n't support ahci or at least on some computers .
edit i 've resolved by using systemd-boot instead of grub i had secured boot disabled so if you have my same issue check for that in the mobo option
want to try this game today but whenever i create a new profile/character it crashes when the loading bar is at 75 .
i 'm designing a small machine that is basically an led with heatsink mounted on a disk .
i want to rotate this disk at high speed and now i need to calculate the torque i need to select the right pulleys and motor .
i was never good at math so if someone could help me out with the calculation i would really appreciate it !
here is a drawing of the machine imgur https imgur.com/4ixgeqg
the disk is balanced at the center using a counterweight .
the shaft is mounted on two bearings with a pulley inbetween going to the drivetrain .
the speed will be constant when it 's at the desired rpm the acceleration time does n't have to be that fast .
now how to calculate the required n to bring this up to 1200rpm ?

plus mobile gamers are much more accepting of predatory micro transactions .
this honestly the single biggest thing in all of this .
many low-quality games that the vast majority of pc and console consumers would reject can thrive on mobile because the audience is accepting of them .
there are many well off players who actually prefer gacha games with p2w mechanics because guess what they enjoy buying power and prestige within a game 's community .
and if they were to switch titles they could only catch up by spending a lot of money too .
so other gacha titles that do n't offer that are n't an option .
if you were to develop one of this monster/hero gacha titles and only had cosmetic microtransactions you might actually lose out on those key whale players .
on mobile so i ca n't post the link right now but i saved a great essay breaking down chomsky co. 's intellectual dishonesty in downplaying the cambodian genocide and the crimes of the khmer rouge and how the matter clearly demonstrates that his propaganda model of media is unfounded .

you just have to dedicate a whole detachment to them wich means you have to either take more units from their faction to fill the detachment or suffer some realy annoying restrictiona or losses in terms of availabe tactics .

from what i 've seen he provides some insightful and articulated arguments on various issues .
i 'm assuming you have n't actually spent any time listening to him though .
here 's the thing i actually did he does n't have any theoretical basis on what he says .
i do n't throw this terms loosely because i do n't want them to lost their meaning but he is indeed a race realist and a white supremacist and the lenghts he will go with his mental gymnastics are absurd .
women who choose the assholes will fucking end this race .
they will fucking end this human race if we do n't start holding them a-fucking-countable .
all the cold-hearted jerks who run the world came out of the vaginas of women who married assholes and i do n't know how to make the world a better place without holding women accountable for choosing assholes !
your dad was an asshole because your mother chose him because it works*on so many women !
if asshole '' was n't a great reproductive strategy it would have been gone long ago .
they protect it with their bodies ... keep fucking monsters we get catastrophes we get war we get nuclear weapons we get national debts we get incarcerations and prison guards and all the other florid assholes who rule the world .

colonial masters never committed anything near the murder and genocide seen under black rule in rwanda burundi uganda nigeria mozambique and other countries where millions of blacks have been slaughtered in unspeakable ways which include hacking to death boiling in oil setting on fire and dismemberment .
also something that an so called anarchist '' would never say .
so there goes the point that he have no intellectual integrity and is just a dude spilling bullshit on the internet to apease his retarded cultists he never presents any research or theoretical basis to his points never directly address any real word issues those are just the major red flags .

as a brit whose now lived here a few years things i like ...
the beach as mentioned before simply because expecting to lie in the sand back home in january is ludicrous .
good excuse for photographs to wind people up on facebook .
whenever my friend from london visits we always make sure to get at least a cubano in as it 's something he ca n't get back home .
not everyone loves 925 nuevos cubanos but i do .
if you want to try a range of cuban food you ca n't go wrong at padrinos lunch buffet .
it 's like 12 and really good my friend ordered it last time i 'll be certain getting it next time .
we 've got a good range of south american food places too but if you 're heading down there anyway i 'd skip on that .
head over to mass and the surrounding areas in the evening there 's a few fun places within walking distance of eachother perfect for an evenings sampling .
glitch is an arcade/beer bar that is all free to play original cabinets as well as some classic consoles .
beer punx is especially great if they have a gig on pretty much always free entry .
invasive species is a really good brewery bar and laser wolf is quite a hipstery craft beer bar too .
obviously if beer is n't your thing this might not be the area for you mind !
just uber to one of these places and you can easily get to the others .
there 's also another outdoor bar called rhythm and vine that always goes down well that 's not far away always enjoy going there .
they usually have a food truck set up and there 's usually one outside glitch too for quick snacks .
another walkable bar area is himmarshee which has a selection of eateries and more regular less hipster/independent bars as well as a museum a walkable riverfront area albeit partially closed due to construction and a big theatre .
walkability is n't our strong point here so prepare to drive or uber to places .
something i like to do with people from out of town/country is get an electric boat tour in the intercoastals .
up to 6 can hire privately but you can always get open spots on the boats .
they basically tour you around the super rich areas so you can gawk at the multimillion dollar mansions and even more expensive mega yachts .
they 'll tell you who owns them and the history of the area etc .
there 's also the water taxi that goes up and down a similar area which is fun too .
if you have anything in particular you like doing i 'm sure we can help further or if there 's anything a fellow brits perspective can help with just let me know .
right now i 've got the barracks at unbelievably impressive '' which is giving me 4 and i 'm getting another 3 from the spacious buff .

i keep population low and everyone is spread out so i 'm not getting disturbed sleep on anyone .

if he works for the money that the koch brothers give him then he is officially a right wing propagandist .
just look at what the koch brothers are all about .
as for hurting financially that really depends on his lifestyle .
i know because my father was a university professor .
if he wants more money and works as a right wing propagandist to make more then that 's fine .
you just have to take that into consideration when evaluating what he says .

according to this special on mlb network last year 's indians team started the alds with an entire starting lineup of former all-stars .
kinda shows how super teams '' are barely a thing in the mlb compared to the nba .
and shows how production can decline quickly after being an all star .
not the best example but i thought it was interesting .
i urge you to look at this twitter account specifically his comments about this case and check out how some people hope for and thrive upon white on black crime .
he used this event as an example of what he calls the melanin war '' between black and white people .
look at how his fans call white people neanderthals '' and cave people '' and beasts '' etc .
hell he 's using this new r kelly doc as an example of how some black people cater to white supremacy and that its just a distraction from white supremacists attacking black people .
this is just another example of one side whether black or white republican or democrat religious or atheist using an even that they think went their way to promote their cause .
just because someone calls out the incredibly inaccurate reporting that some media outlets and activists did does n't make them a racist .
you ca n't trade butterflies specifically you can only share them back and forth in the gardens .
so someone could share 9 butterflies but you only catch 3 and that 's how it goes !

i have no doubt that this was an irrigated farm .
i would n't expect yields to be very good .
that does n't mean someone did n't farm there but it would n't have been the best place to grow anything .
it makes me wonder more about the reasons someone choose to grow things there .
was it a trading post type location or a rest stop along the road ?
was it remote enough to make low yield rates worth it compared to buying crops that had to be hauled in from distant sources ?

ich kann mir aussuchen mit wem ich √ºber was in welchem kontext rede .
um mich mit jedem d√∂del aufzuhalten fehlt mir die zeit und lust .
falls sich jemensch anderes findet der das machen m√∂chte ist das sch√∂n .
klar darfst du das aber du hast es so dargestellt dass seine aussage ihn objektiv nicht dialogf√§hig machen w√ºrde nicht dass du keine lust auf so eine diskussion hast .
was vereinzelt auf irgendwelchen amerikanischen campussen abgeht ist noch l√§ngst kein indiz daf√ºr was der ganze rest der bewegung macht .
ich geh einfach nicht mehr darauf ein weil mich das nicht interessiert und soweit ich das beurteilen kann null relevanz f√ºr die deutsche debatte hat .
das ist nunmal leider kein strohmann sondern eine meinung die es inzwischen sogar in die gr√∂√üeren publikationen wie everydayfeminism salon slate etc etc schafft und dort auch schlicht falschinformation streut .
der bezug zum deutschen besteht aus deutschen bekannten feministinnen wie stokowski wizorek oder der hemgameh die mit etwas zeitverzug den brisanten unsinn nachplappern .
dir ist aber schon bewusst worum es ging oder ?
aufmerksamkeit daf√ºr erzeugen wie weit verbreitet sexuelle bel√§stigung und/oder √ºbergriffe im alltag sind .
wenn ich mir die stories von freundinnen anh√∂re was die alles √ºber sich ergehen lassen m√ºssen l√§ufts mir kalt den r√ºcken runter .
man kann sich jetzt nat√ºrlich beschweren das eine oder andere sei nicht genug repr√§sentiert innerhalb der debatte und das zu recht aber dass dieses thema √ºberhaupt mal gro√üfl√§chig aufgegriffen und diskutiert wird ist schon mal ein gro√üer fortschritt .
das war den leuten nur vorher schon bekannt weil absolut jeder schon mal opfer sexueller bel√§stigung und √ºbergriffen wurde .
stories k√∂nnte dir auch ein mann erz√§hlen in meiner schule wurde beispielsweise ein kerl von einer klassenkameradin unter drogen gesetzt und vergewaltigt .
sie wurde von anderen partyg√§ngern gest√∂rt die wiederum nur mit dem handy aufgenommen haben .
montag nach der ersten stunde hatte dann jeder der ein bluetoothhandy hatte das videomaterial und das opfer hatte den ganzen spott .
niemand in der schule hat das m√§dchen f√ºr verantwortlich gehalten .
anekdoten sind aber auch keine argumente selbst wenn man sie pauschal als wahr best√§tigt gibt es keinen weg festzustellen ob sie auch repr√§sentativ sind .
siehe auch das new york street harrassment video auch wenn das sp√§ter als gefaked herausstellte .
es wird schon vor allem von leuten aufgegriffen die das alte prinzip mann t√§ter frau opfer perpetrieren wollen und daf√ºr gesetzes√§nderungen verlangen .
bevorzugung in schulen im allgemeinen grundschulunterricht im speziellen wird von frauen f√ºr m√§dchen ausgelegt wo jungs st√∂renfriede sind .
hochjazzen von h√§uslicher gewalt zu einem verbrechen was nur von m√§nnern an frauen ausge√ºbt wird obwohl frauen 50 der t√§ter sind .
einrichtung von frauenh√§usern m√§nnerwohnheime sind f√ºr obdachlose und nicht f√ºr echte opfer die fliehen m√ºssen .

if i can get more reapers to stay alive then there is 10 minutes to be saved at dhuum and i 've already been able to start dhuum at 1 hour 25 minutes once so without any tactics improvements there is already 15 minutes to shave off by just doing a cleaner run and getting a little luck at dhuum .

i 'm in a new relationship with a man i like very very much .
he 's started opening up about his past in the last few times i 've seen him and he 's had a rough life that i 'm not going to get into .
i listen to everything he tells me and i try to support him to the best of my abilities .
the one thing is that he jokes about killing himself more than other people do .
it scares me because it 's somewhat founded on real feelings and because i can not ever imagine him doing something like that .
he uses them to cope in his own way and make light of the situation .
he made a joke recently and i started to cry and he apologized and said he would n't do it anymore .
so my question is should i not care about him making jokes like that ?
should i let him use it as his way to cope and put aside my own feelings ?
i do n't want him to think that he ca n't talk to me about it and i 'm worried that asking him to stop will close a door between us .

hey ethan all i have to say is thanks for doing what you do .
you most likely have no clue what your videos plus marks and jacks have done for me .
i do n't have the best mental health but i 've been getting better .
a setback is only a programmed response to your thoughts .
this past month i have manifested an incredible feat i also manifested a setback .
i was stuck in a department with colleagues who i despised .
these people in my mind were rotten petty would stab you in the back immature and i had nothing but contempt for these people .
i was stuck in this department for 1 year .
at the 7 month mark i had had enough .
i decided to envision a scenario in my mind where i cooperated in perfect accord with my coworkers .
i also envisioned being respected by my colleagues and having complete cooperation with them .
over the course of 3 weeks these visions became true and i started getting along with my colleagues .
at the end of 3 weeks a miracle happened .
out of nowhere i was removed from that department and placed in my dream department with colleagues who i was friends with .
but i owe it all to the power of the mind .
a few weeks later i was assigned to write a short but difficult essay to present on .
i dreaded writing this essay and trudged through it with angst and negativity .
due to a slip up in human error or a manifestation i saved over the file and deleted my work .
i had spent a whole day writing this essay and it was gone .
i wrote the essay in a state of resistance and passivity .
and through my own unconscious decisions i deleted the essay .
the lesson here is that a set back is only a result of what is in your mind .
your mind is like a computer it only obeys what you program it with .
the next time you have a setback look at your intentions .
looking to sell some more artisans mx of course .

my girlfriend and i recently moved our betta from his cramped 1.5 gal cube tank into a much more luxurious 10 gallon planted tank .
i 'd love to turn the old tank into a shrimp habitat but i 'm not sure where to begin and i have a few questions .
how many shrimp could i fit in the tank comfortably ?
i 'm planning on getting cherry shrimp but i 'll decide on them after i finish planting the tank .
i 'm planning on buying a whisper 3i filter for the tank but would it be a good idea to also get an air stone ?
i was planning on putting a piece of wood in the tank and attaching plants to it to make it look like a bonsai tree maybe adding some carpeting and some other small plants .
would it be better to heavily plant it or is that a bad idea ?
what kind of substrate would be best for shrimp ?
should i get larger gravel or smaller bits for them to dig around in ?
will a tiny tank like this be too cruel to keep shrimp in ?
i do n't want to stress them out by keeping them confined to such a small space but i really do n't want to just get rid of this tank and i think a tiny aquarium would be really cool .
i 've played against quite a few they usually get to dante and a bit of graveyard stuff then i win .
let me preface by saying that i enjoy playing casually but balanced and i have been playing 6 months on and off .
when i host events i want my playgroup to feel like they had a good time not like we are mentally taxed .
i was searching for post about the next step .
like how to make the game more enjoyable building better terrain homemade making a better looking board building campaigns and being a better host .
i want to introduce other friends to the game but i do not feel like my 40k general knowledge is adequate enough .
last time i introduce someone they said they enjoyed the strategy but it was a little boring .
i guess i need a mentor because i only started this hobby pretty much by myself .
my friend showed me some of his shit.ita pretty fire.but he has n't made anything new in like 20 years.hes pretty small so i 'm asking alot.but does any1 know y he has n't made anything since then.i understand if no one knows he was pretty small

1 about a year ago i bought a squier vm jazzmaster and it occurs to me that eventually i 'll need to change the strings and have no idea what gauge is on there now .
whatever it is feels great so i 'm happy to keep it‚Äî is there an easy way to determine the gauge of strings that are in the guitar ?
should i just assume it 's whatever comes standard on the vm jazzmaster and does anyone know offhand what that is ?
2 if i change my epiphone les paul to a heavier string gauge but then tune down to c and leave it there do i need to set the guitar up all over again ?
or will the decreased tension even out the heavier gauge ?
we 've always had a fairly active sex life 2-3 times week at least with varied sessions and positions .
i m would do the majority of the initiation 75 ?
the last few years frequency and session duration have been decreasing down to maybe 1x/week .
i am now the only one that initiates with her response usually being what do you want ?
lets do it quick i 'm tired '' so there is no foreplay no having fun and playing just straight piv missionary .
it is enjoyable for her and she gets off fairly quickly but is a one-and-done type so i feel pressured to then get myself off quickly as well .
lately even this has n't been happening she has been letting the kids sleep in our bed so if it was n't for a few quickies we 'd be looking at months without any intimacy .
she is a sahm and i handle most of the nighttime routines to give her a break .
we 've talked about it and she at least voices recognition that things sexually are n't where we would want them to be but she does n't seem to ever actually try to change anything .
i 'm trying my best to be helpful and not be resentful but in a high stress job with a busy house it was nice to look forward to some good sex at the end of the day and now thats not happening and it 's hard not to be frustrated .
lately she has said that she feels like i 'm only affectionate if i think i 'm going to get sex which is something i will try to work on see being frustrated above ... but i have also given her backrubs watch the kids so she can nap etc .
without any sort of expectation or pressure of reciprocity .
to complicate things sometimes she is touched out so i have to navigate the mine field of when and how much touching or support she needs .
and i know it 's not totally true but sometime it 's hard not to feel like i 'm the only one giving and i 'm supposed to be able to read minds while doing it .
soooo what i 'm thinking is that i will continue to be supportive and work on being more emotionally and physically available without sex which also means i 'm going to stop initiating .
i figure this will give her a break to see that i 'm not constantly chasing sex and also honestly i 'm just getting tired of thinking about it or wondering if what i can get .
i 'm afraid that this may allow the db to fully establish itself but as i said i 'm tired .
my other question what strategies can help take my mind off of it ?
obviously i can 'take care of myself ' but that does n't seem to fully scratch the itch especially after weeks without meaningful intimacy .
i have a bad habit of buying games on sale for a certain system and never getting around to playing them .
then a new system comes out and the game is ported over with extra content or whatever and i say to myself hey !
i 'm playing this current system a lot more than this older one i 'm sure if i buy this i 'll play it there . ''
i have skyrim for 3 different systems now xbox 360 ps4 switch but i did ultimately end up playing and completing the switch version .
does anyone else have this problem or do you have the self control to not buy ports if you already own a game even if it 's on an older system ?
what happens if you have possibility storm out and cast fling sacrificing a creature then draw into a new fling as the replacement card ?
do you still do damage equal to the creature sacrificed ?
this can also be used with things such as rails glass panes/iron bars ect .

i managed to get a hold of some dmt which i have used a few times with varying doses .
the first attempt was 20mg just to get a feel for the effects .
i experienced some bright colours strange creaking sounds and patterns everywhere but it wore off fairly quickly
i waited a few days before trying a bigger dose i got my so to trip sit me and leave the room this time as i 've read that can help feel less grounded .
i was n't trying to breakthrough or anything just experience something more than the first time .
i loaded 40mg into a home made dmt machine and took 3 big hits i laid back as i exhaled my final hit and fairly quickly there were multiple entities milling around me i felt that they were tending to me and preparing me for what was about to happen i could feel everything around me dissolving then suddenly it felt like i was n't breathing as soon as this thought entered my mind i realised i was breathing and i had to just let the dmt take me where i was going but i could n't stop thinking about my breathing the entities became more rushed and it seemed like they were concerned about me and then they just left .
i did n't feel like they were annoyed like i 've read some people experience just that they were slightly disappointed .
i have experienced what i think was ego death before after drinking 2c-b dissolved in vodka after taking a large dose of mdma i did n't know there was 2c-b in the vodka until someone at the party told me after that i lost all concept of who i was and had no idea what made me me .
it was n't a difficult experience as such it came and went in waves where the cocktail of drugs took over completely then i would become aware that i was tripping .
when i was in this state i knew what made me me .
i just did n't know what made me who my friends and family knew me as if that makes any sense at all .
i was expecting this to be the same concept this is something very different though my so thinks i 'm being dramatic when i tell her that you truly do feel as you 're dying .
i know i need to trust my body and i thought i did !
i can feel the dmt swirling and getting stronger when i let it but i ca n't seem to just accept death ''
do you guys have any advice beside meditation which i do daily anyway and have done before every trip .
i 've been trying to notice more when my breathing becomes automatic but i 'm worried this will just make me more aware of it .
tl dr took dmt a couple of times ca n't let myself die from not breathing .
tried all the things i 've researched like breathing exercises meditating .
i 'm new to the game and have a few questions .
2 are there more towns/cities than just in the center ?
3 should i just always use my lab suit radioactive protection when i go into town ?
in the u.s. anyone watching tv will notice that all day and night regardless of what channel you watch you are subjected to ads for prescription drugs .
presumably this is money that at one time was used for research or to keep the price of drugs more reasonable .
i have tried to google answers to this question but not surprisingly that data seems to be a closely held secret .
neilsen ratings are available to subscribers only but may provide some answers .
one thing i do know is that considering the cost of television ad time the number and length of those ads it has to amount to a lot of revenue .
i see it as a premier example of the immorality of some of our corporate ceo 's .
is there anyone out there with some insider knowledge to shed some light on this ?

plot summary a middle school girl attempts suicide and while she is recovering semi-sarcastically remarks that she wants a certain fruit cherry or plums are what i think i remember .
her father drives for miles to find her fresh cherries/plums .
the last line is more or less a promise to herself that she 'll never attempt suicide again so long as there are fruit and someone who loves me enough to get them ''
i read this short story in 2014-2015 for a creative writing class .
i think it was in a larger collection of short stories but i cant remember if it was an anthology or all by the same person .
thank you so much for any help at all !
i attempted suicide it it caused a lot of problems for my friend .
he ignored the texts when i reached out to him a few hours before and i think he feels guilty about that .
should i be mad at him for ignoring the texts
i got very helpful responses to a question i had some days ago on here so i thought i would try to post some of my writing as well if you are interested to read and critique .
it is the beginning of the origin story of one of the races inhabitating my fantasy world .
for a twist i tried writing this one in english i have often done so before for notes or of course in school and university but never tried to write prose in english .
i would mainly be interested if my use of the language is interesting and grasps the reader enough or if you think that i lack the skill and should rather stick to my mother tongue which is german btw .
of course you may critique whatever you find in there hope someone enjoys this small appetizer of my story .
if you need more background information i am happy to give it but i hope the text gives enough between the lines so that readers rather just wan na continue on with the story instead of thinking about missing information so that 's a point of critique that also interests me a lot .
these characters are all long dead in the story of my novel and i am still struggling with the naming of characters of that race in general .
i hope i posted this in the right manner it is the first time for me .
hi everyone i threw myself into spanish about two years ago and it 's basically like an obsession of mine .
i try to do just about everything in spanish for instance tv radio podcasts reading all the time in spanish etc .
i even host a meetup group at a local coffee shop where people just come and speak in spanish it 's really fun .
however i 've hit the two year mark and feel like i might never be able to speak as fluently as some of my friends for example from ecuador colombia etc .
i 'm 40 and have a job so a lengthy immersion program is n't an option .
i do n't have the money right now to take lessons online but hopefully will be able to soon .
i keep telling myself it will take time and to be patient .
any advice on what i could do to improve even more or success stories from people who experienced the same type of intermediate/low advanced block like i feel right now would be super helpful thanks !

we are such a wonderful couple been together a few years and mostly everyone who knows us thinks we are perfect.we travel often have good jobs and are financial secure .
our house is beautiful and our friends are jealous of our ability to do really well in this world even more so since most of them are having trouble paying student loans .
we go out of our ways to humiliation ourselves .
we are n't always together but every day we try to come home with some story of each other being humiliated .

we will be a perfectly loving couple but we of course try to get humiliated .

i 've just started vaping and was wondering how it works if i vape half or even 3 quarters of a bowl and leave the rest .
i 've noticed that when i do this around 3 quarters and go back to finish it later i ca n't get anything out of it but if i would have smoked it all in one session i would have got more from it .
does the weed lose thc when left in the vape ?
or if i smoke half a bowl and smoke the rest hours later will i get the same out of it ?
it seems like i 'm getting less when i do this
so i 've been clearing cpap and i notice that my damage is rather lacking .
and though i 've been upgrading/changing gear i damage is n't improve a whole lot especially compared to other runeblades .
i personally do n't think im unsually unskilled but hearing some runeblades doing 250mil definately gets me down .
in my stats it is without honing runes and with house pierce buff i have tried with physical pierce buff too to no big increase in dmg .
my dpm on dummy in hoh is about 27-28mil .
i know that my physical pierce is lacking along with my gems/bonus attack bad rng .
i generally try to use the ice echo build .
any advice/help to improve my damage apart from the increase ur weapon thing .
so as the title suggests my game crashes quite frequently and makes playing impossible every half an hour to an hour my game will crash and i have to re load from my last save .
it 's not because of any mods because i 've played a clean save with no mods just vanilla and it crashed just as often .
anyone had the same problem or know a fix that might work ?
i 'm open to pretty much anything at this point .

going into the season i 'd say that most people had harden outside of their top 5 nba players list lebron kd steph giannis ad kawhi all ranked above generally .
a minority had him at number 5 and a few dared to put him at 4 .
but now seeing what he 's done this year halfway through the season where do you have him ?
i 'd say he 's firmly 4 at this point behind lebron kd and steph .
would you agree or do you have him higher/lower ?
i 'm bringing this god idea and i know we already have a representation of the fire giant on conquest but i really like surtr and i think we should able to play as him .
the lava whenever surtr suffers damage from an enemy deity he releases a pool of lava at the current location that lasts 2s .
the pool deals 10 10 of your magical power as damage per second .
sword of fire surtr beats his sword on the ground in a line area with range of 55 units .
and this attack is repeated 3 times followed automatically with an interval of 1s between each hit .
if all the attacks hit the same enemy deity surtr get healed .
you can not use another skill relics or potions while using this ability
fire minion surtr conjures a fire minon at the selected location .
this minion faces the same direction where surtr is pointing when he was cast .
if any enemy passes in front of him the minion runs to that enemy and explodes .
if no enemy passes in front of him the minon explodes after 2 seconds after his casting .
if he get hitted by the fire sword '' the explosion will do extra damage .
beware of fire surtr throws his sword in a straight line .
if you hit an enemy deity the sword will stick to it for 2s .
surtr can use this ability again to teleport to his sword retrieving it .
you can not use your basic attacks while you 're without your sword .
high temperature surtr undoes its graveyard to gain power and movement .
you suffer 10 extra damage from any damage but gain 20 extra magical power and 10 movement for 6 sec .
if surtur dies during this time he turns into a small flame after 4s surtr reborn with 30 of his maximum life and mana .
it 's all in the title i have a figure with two 3d plots .

i have to be honest i have n't been following the islanders for too long .
i 'm from australia and went to my first nhl game at barclays centre on a holiday to new york in december 2016 .
since then i 've fallen in love with the sport and the team and have streamed/watched every game i possibly could .
but i have looked into the history of this team and it 's been a while since they 've looked this promising .
so to all the fans from years and years back i bet it feels great to see your beloved islanders play some playoff level hockey and i myself could n't be happier to be a part of it !

i have a very irrational fear of demon/hell related shit and i feel very uneasy when watching movies or reading books with this theme shoved in my face .
that said doom looks insanely fun and it looks like a game with good graphics that 's actually well optimized for my specs .
this is all i 've ever wanted in a game for a long time just to be able to enjoy the graphics with 60 fps and just get immersed .
however i 'm scared of how heavy the demon stuff gets and i 've been too scared to watch too much gameplay footage of it to find out .
are there cases where people get possessed by demons ?
if so how many and how brutal are the scenes ?
i understand there are demons here but how unsettling is the atmosphere ?
does it depict hell as a tangible thing like an alien world or does it more depict it as we are the anti-christ we are the incarnation of all evil '' kinda thing .
if it 's more like an alien world i can probably deal with it .

its a 50/50 for me honestly i think both teams have quality players and a decent chance to win .
but imo spurs will really be missing kane as i said he 's their star player .
anyway just wanted to try and help some people out with spreading the word about his injury might be helpfull investing .
yup i used it through two seasons and saw consistent gains .
this was in a lower frequency than most people do though most periods of the year it was just once a week .

i 'd like to know the reaction from people who live near clemson because it 's an extremely conservative area .
ambystoma mexicanum are the axolotls people keep as pets and used in lab studies in the us .
there are some people who buy a tiger salamander and mistake it for an axolotl but that 's not the norm and there are people who hybridize axolotls with other ambystomas their ability to hybridize with other species is the reason why states like ca ban them the ban is not related to conservation of axolotls .
there are huge tells as to whether or not it is an axolotl or a different species such as the shape of their toes .
there is no shortage of captive bred ambystoma mexicanum in the us or europe due to how essential they are in many lab studies .
they are also incredibly easy to breed and there is no reason to go to xochimilco to try and capture wild axolotls to keep as pets when they are near impossible to find in the wild .
the captive bred color morphs are also more desirable in the hobbyist community than the wild type color morph which is the only type you will find in their natural habitat .
their wild population has been decimated by pollution and the introduction of invasive species not pet trade .
if you 're curious for more information about axolotls hybrids and other ambystoma species check out r/axolotls and caudata.org .
yes they would n't be in small enough quantities to not be visible .

just pulled chandra is he only useful in pvp or he can be used in some pve areas ?
it 's not because they unlock good characters that they need to be almost given for free .

instead they are the easiest farm that remain useful afterwards for tw and tb and yet you still manage to complain about it .

i wonder if he is planning a go at the atwr raw bench .
i do n't even know what the multiply is did tiny meeker 's 1102 count ?
the fact of the matter is dak has won 2/3rds of this games .
he was offensive rookie of the year and a pro bowler .
he 's led over a dozen come from behind victories .
he 's been to the playoffs twice and he 's won a playoff game .
defenses do not fear what he can do with the ball in his hands and it shows .
the clear and present danger is always ezekiel elliott and they will sell out in order to stop him at all costs .
for dak to be successful he will need to put fear into defensive coordinators .
zeke is good enough right now to beat loaded boxes more often than not and keep them in 3rd and manageable .
but i tell you right now look at that rams game again .
if dak prescott was truly a threat they win that game against the rams even if the rams were running all over the cowboys defense .
what the cowboys need from dak going forward is the persistent and credible threat that dak will make you pay with his arm if you try to stop zeke by stacking the box .
that at any given moment he can strike you deep and flip field position .
that if you take his running game away he can still destroy you .
until that happens i will point out how inaccurate he really is .
for others reading burningrr seems to have a vendetta against me and posts these long attacks commonly .
as i 've said in previous conversations my issue is the misinformation arrogance disrespect manipulation and generally bullshittery .
those are personal problems so i can appreciate why you 'd take my comments personally .
as i 've said before i 'd probably enjoy having conversations with you if you put a good faith effort into trying to discuss photography tech rather than spread crackpot theories and protect your own ego .
ignoring all that you have plenty to offer the community .
recently in another thread he accused me of just spouting results from dxomark on a the photonstophotos.net web site but it is not my web site and the guy who does the site bill claff is a superb engineer who has analyzed dxomark data plus his own data and has done an amazing job it is a great resource .
bill 's site is excellent and it 's my primary resource for sensor data .
he makes several cautionary remarks about the dxo derived values .
perhaps you might cite what you think disputes what i said then maybe i can clarify your confusion again .
the patent shows how phase waveforms are compared to confirm focus .
it disputes your point that phase detection is lost when the subject is in focus .
but rather than making attempts to impeach the multiple sources that disprove your theories perhaps you should start looking for some citations that confirm your theories .
if they did i would n't be arguing with you .
i 'm more interested in knowing how stuff works than protecting my ego .
it 's not accurate if you 're only calibrating for one focus distance and focal length .
so burningrr show us your mirrorless action photography images .
specifically shows us subject moving fast toward the camera like a bird in flight or a running animal or person .
here are some of mine made with a dslr .
that 's a series of two consecutive shots taken on an a7ii with an adapted a mount tamron 150-600 lens under non-ideal conditions at relatively short distances .
btw sony disables the hybrid autofocus features when shooting with adapted a glass so this is mostly the phase focus system .
but rather than give you the chance to attack the quality of my photography i 'll link you to this comparison of the d5 and a9 by max yuryev https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kx1sfy__7a4 t=8m17s where they conclude https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=kx1sfy__7a4 t=25m19s that the a9 tracks focus across the z axis slightly better .
i think nyxl are the best team in the league and it 'll take a lot for that opinion to change .
london have shown probably the highest peak that we have seen in overwatch to date but they just have n't shown consistency over the course of an entire season and have done nothing yet to show that they can .
if london maintain the level that they showed in the playoffs then they are no doubt the best team in the league but as of now nyxl are my pick .
this is n't an issue of who plays what where .
this is an issue of you 'complaining ' about how much agency a role gets and the bot lane has primarily been ad carrys and a support and balanced as such .
you wanting the bot lane to suddenly shift into playing other champs wo n't happen it 's not realistic as a number of players have been playing primarily adcs only in the bot lane and riot themselves have balanced it around that way for 8 years
except that patch where you could play mages in botlane while doing pretty much the same thing as adcs .
but riot caved under pressure instead of letting that meta continue .
in time people would have learned new stuff just like other roles did .
the fact is that nothing will change and botlaners will always lack diversity as long as riot keeps reinforcing this meta for the simple fact that there really are n't that much designs you can make around the concept of a ranged auto attack carry that were n't already made before especially when you have only 4 abilities .
that means you have to chose a combination of cc mobility steroids and utility to put on them in different depending on how mobile you want your adc how much poke he can have how much shields or utility he can bring how hard you want him to hit by giving a steroid .
in the end all adcs are the same concept in different combinations of what i just said .
for their entire csgo experience and would n't necessarily want to switch to another gun/role
1 point of being the best or trying to be the best is being adaptable .
if you ca n't adapt you do n't deserve ranking up .
as i said all other roles had to deal with that .
it 's not like i 'm asking riot to persecute one role in particular .
i 'm asking riot to treat all roles the same way .
you calling them complainers is n't going to cause the conversation to advance .
you 're just stalling with your own hyprocital pov .
i 'd be okay with you calling my point wrong since obviously not everyone will belive the same thing as i do but how on earth am i a hypocrite for wanting every role to be treated the same way ?
yea i ca n't find the right word to call the name of such ppl who only breed for money let 's just call them greedy ignorant cunts for now .
my cat and i are on a diet together ... and i admit it is easier for me to keep her on her goals than to keep myself on mine !

believing in a specific ideology and carrying it throughout your life has many benefits you stand for something you can focus on more specific issues you can grow and gain a solid/specific fanbase or group you find confidence in identity etc .
despite this i believe it blinds you by default .
if you are leftist and believe the right is completely wrong and without truth..
if you are an atheist and believe religion is completely wrong and without truth..
if you blame socialism for many race or gender related problems and believe that the opposite is without truth..
if you believe holding one ideology blinds you by default and believe that doing so is without its truth..

ive had various smart home stuff for years and over the last couple of years i 've had updates or new bits that support homekit .
got quite a few bits now that all the family use .
but i think we only really use the basics and it 's a bit of a mess .
i 'm after suggestions to make better use of the kit setup and homekit because at the moment we are sticking to the individual apps seeing as with 2 v young kids we get wrapped up in that .
ikea tr√•dfri bulbs have a hub but it 's unplugged

i 've been seeing this guy i met on tinder for 2 months and a bit and everything 's been going great on all fronts we clicked he texts every day we see each other a few times a week i met his colleagues and friends and the two of us spent new year 's together .
he also recently mentioned he has n't slept with anyone else since our thing started so did i .
now my issue is that i saw tinder and hinge notifications pop up a few times on his phone although i could n't exactly see what sort of notifications they were might have just been some sort of 'do n't keep your match waiting ' thingy .
he has not made any updates on his profile at all since we started dating though .
i think i 'm developing strong feelings for him and really need to know if we are on the same page but wondering if 2 months might be too soon to have an exclusivity talk and that i might ruin it by asking such questions too soon ?
so i thought i might repay my dues for some horribly built models during my childhood and adventure down the path of modern model making ...
it is definitely fun but holy crap does the time just disappear .
i mean i am new to this as far as this decade goes so there is a lot of trial and error ... and for some insane reason i decided to jump back in with a 1/72 jet model but the tiny parts are not really what is slowing everything down .
it is mostly just the learning process of trying to do things right for once .
oh and lack of stock ... lack of stock in usa is kinda weird but is definitely a thing .
does tamiya usually have a hard time keeping up with demand ?
airbrushing has been super fun to learn i think i am gon na stick with acrylics as ... . tonight i decided to try mr surfacer 1200 on some parts because well videos and well what a nightmare .
it gunked up my airbrush iwata revolution so bad and it was at this moment that i learned the difference between enamel and lacquer i always thought they were the same thing .
several hours later and no progress made on the model but i finally have a clean airbrush again .
i have not yet figured out what to do when i get to the clear coat phase .
tamiya clear gloss is no where to be found in the us at the moment .
my local hobby lobby has some rattle can clear but i have started to fall in love with the tamiya brand paints .
i have tried a few non-essential decals using simple water application and i can see why there are third party helpers but again finding stock available in the us is proving difficult .
i should support my local hobby shop and honestly i have not had the opportunity to travel the 50 minutes to check out the store but they are closed on sundays which at the moment is pretty much my only day off why do retail stores close on sundays ?
i know this seems like a long rant of negative things i have encountered so far but do n't fret ...

will post final product if it meets my approval ...
hi i noticed something the last few months more and more people flame and get toxic or troll but if they dont write but for example int a game or do some other shit the system wont detect it
how can that be a thing that chatting is a reason for a ban even if its just 3 letters e.g .
k y s and the whole game the person behaves but a person who doesnt chat but instead ints or trolls for 30 min straight

ive been together with my gf for a while now almost 10 years and we already moved together .
the house we live in belongs to the parents of her stepdad and they live in the appartment right below us .
there is a long tradition of beeing winegrowers in my gf family so this house is one of the oldest in our town .
there is a huge yard and a huge barn .
to get to the garden you need to walk either through the barn or walk completely around the property so its out of question that we walk right through the barn .
since the garden is accessible for basically anyone in town we do lock the barndoor which leads to the garden .
a while ago my girlfriend was on vacation with her grandparents so i was alone with our 2 dogs .
it was a rainy day around 6pm and also pretty dark outside .
so the lazy guy i am i didnt want to take the dogs for a long walk but let them run in the garden for 10 minutes .
so i grab the leashes a flashlight and walked outside to the barn .
i opened the door and heard weird noices and my dogs started barking .
so before going to the garden i took the dogs back into the house and inspected first alone because it was hard enough the hold the flashlight and 2 dogs at the sametime while also investigating whats wrong there .
i thought there might be a fox or something .
after getting the dogs back to the house i opened the barndoor again and searched with the flashlight for anything and i saw dozen of broken winebottles all around the place .
as i walked towards the middle of the barn i got the shock of my life .
a middle aged guy half naked dirty unkempt and wet run to me screaming ‚Äûi am so sorry .
i yelled at him ‚Äûstay right where you are ! with shaking knees as i was about to passout because of fear .
i asked him who the fuck he was and why he is here .
he wasnt able to speak really clear and seemed to be confused and even more scared than i was .
he told me that he is searching for karen .
i told him that there is no karen on this property and that he needs to leave immidiately or i have to call the cops .
i was about to open the door to the garden so that he can leave as i realized that this door is always closed and there is no way he got in here through this door .
i realized he must have gotten on the property through another way and walked into the barn .
as i was leading him the other way out he was right behind me and i realized i should probably let him go first because that moment i was so scared that he might got a knife and is about to ram it in my back .
he apologizes again for breaking into our property but told me again that he is searching for karen .
i repeated that there is no karen on this property and told him to leave .
as he was leaving he mumbled ‚Äûim sure she lives here .
later that day the grandparents her stepdads parents came home and i told them about the incident as i was still cleaning the barn .
i dont know if it was coincidence but i felt like i was in a bad horrorstory because they told me that about 30 years ago a woman named karen broke atleast once a week into the property claiming that all of this belongs to her .
local police wasnt doing anything about her because she was mentally ill and one day she was gone .
that was probably the scariest week of my life .
beside many stories in this subreddit this one is actually true and happened a while ago .
so i have n't played skyrim in over 4 years i think and am currently doing a fresh reinstall because the game would n't launch .
needless to say all my modded saves are probably lost so i 'm starting a new one .
i want to know if you guys could recommend me some mods for a playthrough i have in mind or maybe recommend some other ideas for modded playthroughs .
my idea was to use alternative start to make a character who works a shitty job in the city and decides to run away and live in the wilderness for a while using frostfall for that then he 'll develop into a vagrant going from town to town taking quest installing the notice board mod for witcher style quest boards and the endgame might be settling down maybe something like that one mod that let 's you run a brewery .
i 'm also looking for a mod that let 's me not be the dragonborn and that works with alternative start appart from that i 'm open for suggestions .
i recently built my first pc and decided to use a powerline adapter rather than a wi-fi adapter as the router in my house is downstairs and it 's not practical to run a cable upstairs .
yesterday i set up the powerline adapter for the first time and there were no issues .
however last night i tried to connect to the wi-fi using my ps4 but i was unable to .
i brought my ps4 downstairs to try and it worked so took it back upstairs and it did n't .
then this morning no devices were able to connect to the wi-fi in any room except my room where my pc is connected to my powerline adapter except the ps4 which still would n't work .
i unplugged the ethernet cable from the router and the wi-fi started working on all devices over the house again .
i tried reconnected the ethernet cable but the wi-fi stopped working again .
any ideas on what could be causing this issue ?
and if there 's anything i can do to fix it ?

so i just got the slim a week ago already completed uncharted 4 on it now starting horizon zero dawn .
like they are kind of choppy and there is some fps drop which occurs rarely like 1-2 times when i play for 5-6 hours .
is it because of my eyes not being used to them yet or is my slim defective ?
also my slim is plugged to a power splitter in which other devices are plugged too and sometimes the slim does n't turn on .
it turns on only when i remove the other devices from the splitter .
i 've been trying to master the art of color correction and color grading .
i watched many many hours of tutorials and i feel like i have a very nice grasp on shooting editing and color correcting and grading .
however for the life of me no matter what i shoot i ca n't never get a nice appealing clean cinematic '' look .
i do n't know what the hell i 'm doing wrong it 's very frustrating .

this is very frustrating and discouraging.can some please take a look at these two videos and color correct and grade them with a look that you thing is appropriate and share the project file with me to see what i was doing wrong and maybe learn from it .

also his wifi he 's getting only 45 mbps which to me seems very low if his actual speed is 250 mbps .
should i tell him to get a new router or modem ?
yup i 'm also in rural ok and was slightly confused by the whole question because of how common it is for me to see people with guns openly carried .

i 've attempted suicide more than once over the years but did n't tell anybody at the time once in the house of a psychologist my dad 's girlfriend and living partner who ignored me choking myself in the room next door .
i later cut my arms to ribbons called the mental health service/team i 'd been given different tablets by so they sent 2 paramedics round who tested my blood and said there 's nothing they could do .
nhs mental health service at it 's finest y'all .
they did say at the rough sleepers organization that they could n't introduce me to anybody who had at least some idea of what to expect as i go through the particularly non-specific mental health care plan i signed in my psychologists and dad 's missus front room .
everything my fault chime the family go see a doctor they say .

hoping someone can help me with a projector/receiver/firetv setup issue i ca n't figure out .
i recently bought a house with a theatre room .
house was built in 2004 so they left all the equipment which was sadly also purchased around that time .
i have a sony vpl-hs10 projector which only has rgb component svideo and dvi ports that run to a media closet where the receiver is .
i replaced the old receiver with a yamaha rx-v673 so i would have hdmi ports .
i ultimately want to plug an amazon firetv into receiver so i can watch netflix amazon prime and most importantly plex but i ca n't get the projector to show anything .
i have the amazon firetv plugged into hdmi 1 on the receiver and the rgb cables plugged into component on receiver with an optical cable between the two .
i know i need a new projector but trying to make this one last a while until i find which one i want and budget for it .

also i 'm pretty sure it does not have anything with sheathe command or selecting an empty weapong set .

my roommate we 'll call her laurel has been best friends with my girlfriend also our roommate there 's also 2 guys who live with us since high school .
i 've known bella the girlfriend since our senior year sophomore in college now and for the entirety of our friendship/relationship bella has been coming to me when laurel makes her angry for whatever reason .
bella is upset with laurel more often than she is n't and it 's not anything new .
when it is i just listen but i ca n't help but feel protective and angry about it .
last week we all got drunk i do n't normally drink so this was kind of a big deal for me and laurel and i ended up talking about her mental health struggles .
one thing led to another and drunk me told her that i do n't think her problems are just anxiety i think she smokes weed as a bandaid fix and it 's making things worse and the killer i think she has borderline personality disorder and her mom might too maybe should n't have said that but i did .
for the record i 'm not the first person who brought up bpd .
bella 's psychologist aunt did in high school i 'm just the first person to tell laurel because i dated someone who had it and recognize the self destructive manipulative impulsive and harmful symptoms .
she promptly freaked the f out ran out our front door taking her girlfriend coincidentally one of my best friends with her .
now they 're both super pissed at me and want me to apologize but i do n't want to .
my moral justification for the comment is that i was being completely honest about something that bella and i have been talking about for months and i said it in the most kind way i possibly could .
the timing could have been better and it sucks that she 's hurting but i 'm not sorry and i 'd be lying if i said i was .
the real kicker to all of this is that the four of us bella me and the guys decided this weekend to ask laurel to move out when our lease is up .
bella is hurting because of laurel but laurel ca n't see that and it 's not healthy to have to live in that environment especially when the rest of us are impacted because of it .
i have no idea what to do but things are very very uncomfortable in the apartment and i 'm the one being blamed for it .
i knew when i saw his friend request on facebook it was a terrible idea to accept .
he 's 16 years older than me and was the guy who taught '' me how amazing sex could be when i was 19 and we worked together .
up until that point i had n't even entertained the idea of cheating .
after weeks of texting that led into sexting that led into planning to get together the nagging feeling of doing something wrong '' faded into a near-perpetual sense of excitement and anticipation .
part of me now wishes that first reconnection '' meeting would have been a disappointment but god it was anything but .
his whole demeanor was intoxicating his confidence his control it was like he knew he had me from the second we got together .
once things turned physical his attentiveness to my body and making me feel wanted had me more turned on than i 've been in years and made me want to reciprocate that attention just as strongly .
his size both in stature and endowment the way he was assertive without being domineering or cliche the way he worked my body with both his hands and mouth the way those same hands gripped my hips tight when he got behind me the sound my ass made slapping off his thighs as he took me one hand wrapped in my hair ... ugh ...
i swore i wouldnt catch feelings but i 'm completely in lust with him .
i know i desperately dont want to stop but i also know he 's just a fling .
i have no idea why im even posting this i just needed to get it out to someone .
not a birdwatcher or anyone who knows about birds i just wanted to question this .
i was just walking home chester uk when i heard a load of geese .
after it continuing for about 4 minutes i looked up and against the dark clouds i managed to make out the giant v shapes .
i do n't know how many passed before i looked but i saw at least a dozen probably more because i was walking and looking up every now and then formations pass me in a couple of minutes each with huge amounts of geese in .
i would estimate that some of the vs had over 200 geese .
so in the approx 7 minutes i could hear them i reckon there to have been up to 5000 geese .
they were flying north west and it was sleet/snowing .
to maximize my cp i want to include the following outrider detachment as part of my tau sept triptide list
this is legal to do but i lose sept traits so no 1 leadership on ethereal and no overwatch on 5 's for the shield drones .
i do retain my keywords to allow for savior protocols on other tau sept units and the ethereal invocations still work .
i still unlock and can use the 2cp orbital markerlight strategem while losing nothing really significant besides the ethereals 1 to leadership .
so i found a little gem of a gif over on a hypnosis subreddit and ... well ... it got the wheels in my mind turning and the ideas began to go spark .
so much so that i felt like i needed to play this out with someone or someones .
specifically subby men who like to please or enjoy a fair bit of cuckolding and feminization .
what i was thinking is that i play a dominant that the two of you come across online .
you two are curious but willing to try anything at least once .
so i send you two a little video of what exactly i can do .
little do you know that this video is a training video to turn you into my cute little obedient slaves .
and once you 've watched it you have no other pleasure in the world than my voice .
maybe you 're siblings or related in some way ?
maybe you 're friends looking for some relaxation guide and stumble on me .
maybe the two of you know exactly what you 're getting yourself into finally taking the plunge and becomings someone 's hypnotized sex toys .
or maybe we 're just a bunch of gamers that never meet in person and i send you two a video to turn you into my personal healsluts .
the possibilities are endless and open on this one .
note you do n't actually have to be a couple or be in a relationship to play this out .
however you do get bonus points if you are .
you can also get points for playing a lesbian couple/sisters/two females in general for being both taller than me i 'm 5'3 '' or being an interracial couple .
i also have a few pictures from the artist i can show you for some other prompt ideas .
hello so i 'm 23/f a us citizen and my fiance 22/m is a british citizen .
we plan on moving him to me as it is more convenient than me moving to the uk .
however one big thing i worry about is that i have debt .
it 's mainly medical from when i had a very unexpected surgery and then lost my job .
i plan on attempting to pay off any debt this year and applying for his fiance visa next year .
i know i have to basically 'sponsor ' my fiance when i apply and as a result i have to prove sufficient income but i want to know if my debt is going to hurt me in this aspect .
my friends and i got basketball tickets online but one of them got a seat in a different row .
is it possible to ask the campus ticket booth to give us tickets for nearby seats and cancel the ones we got before or do we just hope someone will switch seats with our friend ?

she was the firstborn of the prime minister but was switched at birth in infancy to eke out a living in the city .
when she finally returned to her family she found herself in the throes of inner residence scheming instead .
she wanted to reside peacefully with her sisters and be a filial member of the younger generation of the family but this gem of a family did n't want to leave her be !
thus she woke up to the harsh reality that she herself would have to join in the fray in order to live a good life !

i 've been switching blades on my excel stick throughout 1 year .
i 've probably done it between 5 and 8 times .
and yesterday at practice i remarked that my blade could move a few degrees in and out so for example when i do a slap shot the blade absorbs the shot and moves backwards a bit which is reaaaaallly annoying .
it 's not the first time that it happens to me on that stick but never had the problem on my other stick oxdog
so i already began to apply some glue on the stick end before inserting the blade did that for the last 3 times i switched blades which helped but does not seem to last long enough ...
can you tell if this is normal or should n't happen ?
what more can i do to make my blade as glued as possible to the shaft ?
or do i need to reapply glue every 2 weeks ?

i 'd disagree i think that only applies if you 're good enough to consistently take on a decent amount of raiders and players but i think that still misses the point that you can go in with nothing run to the high-spawn locations and make a non-negligible amount of money with zero investment cost or penalty ... or come in with anything and risk anything at all .
when presented with these two options i really ca n't blame people for choosing to hatchet run and i think that is a sign of a bad system being in place one that i think would benefit us all to have addressed .

i am in fact using 4.21 i have no idea why it compiles then still quite new to utalizing unreals delegates i 've only previously used them to expose events to blueprints .
i first thought like you did it actually worked exactly like it only i had a getter for it and it wasnt public .
however since it 's a very tight system i did n't want anything but a atriggeractor to be able to bind to this delegate hence why i made a method to set up the callback with .
the design idea for it so far is for the atriggeractor to drive all the logic literally all no other logic goes into anything else hence why the method takes an atriggeractor .
the reason for the delegate really is i dont want any other object to be able to call atriggeractor ontriggeroptioncompletedcb to start the chain of triggering the system is basically a chain reaction of trigger to handle gameplay logic so it 's private and then i set it up to be called from the trigger option through a delegate so it can access the private method .

i have read thorough all that but they used the asking for prophet muhammad p b.u.h when he was alive to justifies doing it when he is dead there is a event with ummar bin al-katab a cliphate and companion one year the rain did n't come down he said o allah !
we would use our prophet as a means to you and you then sent us rain now we use our prophet 's uncle as a means to you therefore send us rain ! ''
if using tawasul to the prophet pbuh was good ummar one of the people who was rightly guided told to be of people of jannah when he was still alive would have done that .
that means asking death people should n't be done since they have not connection in this life anymore and can nor harm or send pleasing surah fatir 35:13 and those whom you invoke other than him do not possess as much as the membrane of a date seed .
surah al-a'raf 7:194 indeed those you call upon besides allah are servants like you .
so call upon them and let them respond to you if you should be truthful.
and by no mean by saying that am trying to lower the rank of the prophet pbuh indeed he is the best of those who walking upon the earth but why asking him to ask forgiveness for you when allah said in surah al-baqara ayah 186 and when my servants ask you o muhammad concerning me indeed i am near .
i respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon me .
so let them respond to me by obedience and believe in me that they may be rightly guided. .
and more verses like this why people try to make medium between them and allah ?

the balance transfer must be completed by month 4 .
meaning if your chase account is the one you 're transferring from and it is a citi card you are going to it sounds like it may be the simplicity you 're looking at ?
you have 4 months to tell citi to take over your chase balance after being accepted for the card before the 0 for 21 months offer expires .

here 's a great post https www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/qdmb8/the_same_day_my_doctor_told_me_my_cancer_was that demonstrates that sort of false validity we apply to upvotes and how easy it is to manipulate people on this site

i hope your mother pulls through and beats the shit out of it .
it was rough for us because we honestly went from having a baby in august of that year to this happening right around the first week of december .
the first hospital misdiagnosed her as just having pneumonia then they tested the fluid and realized that it had cancer cells in it .
her legs were swollen and filled with cancerous fluid also .
said they could n't start chemo till mid january .
the care was horrible and it just seemed like they were leaving her there to die .
my wife and i told them to fuck off and we got her discharged before christmas and took her january second to a better hospital 40 mins away .
the second day they saw her they did chemo and had a plan to attack it .
issues with her kidneys chemo almost killing her at one point and everything else under the sun .
spent a month in the special icu forget the name but she had a nurse solely dedicated to her 24/7 .
the oncologist retired right after my mil was declared cancer free we all blame her for being so stubborn throughout the whole ordeal .
they said a ca 125 of 9000 was pretty unheard of and to come back from that was a miracle .
the foreskin has 20000 nerve endings but still is n't as sensitive as a women on her period .
i will bite your bloody legs of if i see another monty python meme

i just started a new job for a couple of days and i feel like i 'm making a big mistake .
i wanted to return back to my old company because of the people and work culture there .
the difference between my current job is that it 's a contract position while my old one was a permanent one .

and on the downside i have to pay a month 's salary for compensation üòû

so i 've already lost like 80+lbs through cico and lowering carbs .
i 'm waiting for surgery that i desperately need and the hospital just told me i need to lose another 12lbs in only 4 weeks or they wo n't operate .
i 'm under 1400 calories per day i 'm not allowed any exercise for medical reasons hello the surgery will make it possible to exercise again !
but i 've lost a lot of weight already it has n't plateaued but i usually only lose 1lb a week these days .
should i just give up on being as healthy as possible and just do fucking meal replacement scam shakes for the next 4 weeks ?
please advise me i 'm heartbroken because i have poor quality of life until this operation is done and if i do n't have it in 4 weeks i wo n't get it for a year or two .
ultimate goal is 140 but i 'm working towards that anyway .
activity is very very limited due to medical problems .
i 'm not allowed do any exercise at all .
i clock up 25,000 steps a day in work and that 's it honestly i 'm not allowed anything more i 'm not allowed even do low impact right now .

hey guys ive been playing the game for 3/4 months i have a gf with 16.1 k il that i use as a buffer for the hard dg¬¥s but i feel like sometimes i dont impact the game as much as a op or dps kinda of classes i would like to know if some of you play the class-toon and have some tips that you would like to share with me thank you for your time and attention .
i reconnected with someone after a year and went to dinner .
we picked up asking about one thing or another and i found myself oddly defending poly based on whatever article she read recently .
welllllll that is n't really my situation but ... ..
yes i remember that situation or what i said but that is n't poly specific it 's just the dating situation i was in at the moment .
or i donno i have n't done that but i can see that would be messy .
sometimes poly is explained blamed associated attributed or any number of things when it is only nominally associated .
i often resist the urge to dismiss poly as the cause the reason or the fuel for the situation but interesting that others cling to it as the scapegoat .
i do n't always put the effort in to dispel the myths and slight truths but i am annoyed by the burden it paints my situations .
do you take the time to distinguish poly from your specific situation ?
i am glad that nynaeve is riding with rand .
also i think i have a mini crush on min .
for some reason i could n't imagine the leaving from the inn segment without rains .
perineal tears incidence and risk factors a four years experience in a single saudi center by ahmad talal chamsi in interventions in gynaecology and women 's healthcare in lupine publishers https preview.redd.it/4092kef7fcd21.jpg ? width=166 format=pjpg auto=webp v=enabled s=f8ddfded3f6289b2af83163aa44d059c031d8306
background perineal trauma is a common event in obstetrics affecting up to 90 percent of primiparous and is sometime associated with considerable post-natal morbidity and mortality 1 .
these patients are at an increased risk of recurrent severe perineal lacerations in subsequent deliveries 2 .
many of these patients develop subsequent anal incontinence and sexual dysfunction despite an adequate primary sphincter repair 3 .
objectives the aim of the study is to highlight the frequency and severity of perineal tears during vaginal delivery which leads to major physical psychological and social problems .
study design and methods this retrospective cohort study analyzed all vaginal deliveries from january 2011 to december 2015 in security forces hospital riyadh saudi arabia .
data were extracted from dedicated database software for antenatal care through hospital system medical record viewer mrv and from midwife head nurse daily record system .
the data used were already available for the analysis for all patients as part of the clinical report of the obstetrics and gynecology department of security forces hospital .
results a total of 28325 patients were admitted for vaginal deliveries .
of them 406 1.4 patients sustained second third or fourth degree perineal tears .
of the 406 patients 285 70.1 were primiparous and 121 29.9 were multiparous .
the mean age of the study population was 28.08¬±7.47 ranging between 17-42 years table 1 .
of the total 139 32 delivered spontaneously while 276 68 delivered with the help of vacuum delivery .
the primigravida were significantly associated with the frequency of severe lacerations p 0.006 .
perineal tears were not significantly associated with episiotomy p 0.623 .
the occurrence of tears was in 313 44.3 when birth weight 4 kg p 0.001 .
identification of risk factors vigilant monitoring and supervision by senior doctors during difficult deliveries and good perineal support is recommended for minimizing the risk of perineal trauma as well as morbidity .

the watchtower is a type this means that the scripture is talking about the anti-christ but it also has partial application in false religions the man of lawlessness is not limited to the watchtower but can be applied to other cults .
1 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm now we request you brethren with regard to the coming or presence of our lord jesus christ and our gathering together to him rapture in jw theology the resurrection that began in 1914
2 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us to the effect that the day of the lord has come future deception in the last days watchtower awake magazines .
3 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm let no one in any way deceive you for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed the son of destruction jesus will not return until the anti-christ is revealed the watchtower is exposed and destroyed
4 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship so that he takes his seat in the temple of god displaying himself as being god .
the anti-christ will literally sit down in the 3rd temple of god that will be rebuilt by the jews in the future the governing body have literally made themselves god in the minds of jehovah 's witnesses by their doctrines and actions
5 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm do you not remember that while i was still with you i was telling you these things ?
6 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm and you know what restrains him now so that in his time he will be revealed .
7 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way .
8 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm then that lawless one will be revealed whom the lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of his coming anti-christ is killed at the second coming governing body is killed at second coming all religions will be destroyed at the second coming whether they were annexed into the anti-christ 's religion islam or not
9 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm that is the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of satan with all power and signs and false wonders anti-christ will use witchcraft governing body use the activity of satan with signs and false wonders just look at the stupid things jws say that prove this is god 's organization ''
10 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm and with all the deception of wickedness for those who perish because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved .
all followers of the anti-christ governing body will perish because they did not love the truth so as to be saved
11 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm for this reason god will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false
12 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth but took pleasure in wickedness .
13 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm but we should always give thanks to god for you brethren beloved by the lord because god has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the spirit and faith in the truth .
14 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm it was for this he called you through our gospel that you may gain the glory of our lord jesus christ .
15 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm so then brethren stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught whether by word of mouth or by letter from us .
16 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm now may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace
17 http biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm comfort and strengthen your hearts in every good work and word .
ultimately the chapter is directly aimed at the anti-christ .
the governing body will lead jehovah 's witnesses into taking the mark of the beast though and all jws will be converted into radical muslims both cults deny that jesus is god and since the governing body are already confirmed to be satanists they will undoubtedly lead the jws into islam with some false bs new light explanation and twisting of scripture to make them all believe its true and since they worship the governing body instead of jesus they will happily accept this along with the false wonders of the anti-christ i am talking the strongest forms of witchcraft that will deceive if possible the elect stuff you see in movies and games coming to real life .
daniel 2:43 and in that you saw the iron mixed with common clay they will combine with one another in the seed of men but they will not adhere to one another even as iron does not combine with pottery .
who 's seed is combining with the seed of men ?
demons for just as in the days of noah so will it be in the last days they may pose as islam 's version of angles or alien/angel hybrids this will undoubtedly deceive many people into worshipping the anti-christ who is possessed by satan himself .
i 'm looking to create a game like mario where there are worlds where you can walk in 3-dimensional space and enter levels .
and also not allow players to go past levels they have n't passed yet .
as well as make it so that after the levels are passed the player can come back into the same room but the things blocking the player from moving would disappear and the paths would fil in .
i do not know how to create an overworld that would not include multiple rooms to make one world .
this comes from an argument i had recently about how little impact western players have in the owl .
personally i do n't think that true so i thought i 'd ask the sub .
obviously if you feel differently that plays a part .
hey guys i just wanted to put my experience out there to prevent it from happening to others .
i recently purchased a water pipe from a seller on dhgate .
i tracked it today and it says in has been delivered in san antonio texas about four states over from my home in georgia .
it was not an expensive item it was just one that i really wanted .
i messaged the seller to no response because that would be to easy .
i went on to live chat and was placed in a eleven person que so i waited and would check the que until i was number two and then bam the live chat became unavailable and i was sent back to tang tang .
and it would not let me on live chat after .
i am unable to open a dispute because its still within the delivery window .
i have messaged customer service and now wait for a response .
i 've seen a lot of people discussing how they 're disappointed with amnesty and how it does n't appeal to them in the same way that balance did .
i 'm currently on episode 8 and i have n't been able to make myself finish it .
i 'm aware that it takes a while for a show to find its footing and i 've seem some posts indicating that the story has really taken off recently .
aka what would you tell those of us who are n't fans in order to change our minds ?
feel free to talk about specific moments but please use spoiler tags for anything huge .
apologies if this has been done before the only similar threads i could find looked like they 'd contain spoilers so i stayed away .
i just wanted to thank them for taking on metroid prime 4 and let them know i have the fullest confidence in their abilities to make a great game that we 've all been waiting for .
their website does n't seem have a listed email address and i prefer email as a means of contacting companies for this sort of thing .
every now and then i still send mom a message via google .
there really is n't much left aside from what i remember .
so we 're coming up on two years gone .
in fact i still forget every now and then .
the last time i tried to call her was about 2 months ago .
the lady on the other end was n't mean i just told her i had dialed the wrong number .
i had n't it just was n't who i wanted to speak to .
i 've since then deleted mom 's phone number .
when there 's something i want to talk to her about i ca n't .
there are n't many people out there who know the frustration of not having that person to talk to .
just like there was no substitute for my oma or my opa .
i understood with the death of my grandparents that this is part of life .
i was very sad do n't get me wrong .
there 's a hole that 's not going to fill up .
trae understands the void with the loss of his dad a short time before mom went .
it 's a succubus of time and wasted memory for phones .
it is mostly a billboard of all things that are important to you but may not be that big of a deal to someone else .
i 'm not on here often with the exception of sharing pictures of sebastian and karoline .
i do n't like many posts not because i do n't actually like them but because i do n't have time to click like '' for every single thing .
what i do like this type of forum for is for expressing things that i ca n't get out in any other format .
i do n't mind others reading and i do n't mind if you do n't .
i do n't mind if you like or do n't like the post .
i only wanted to get something off my chest .
i remember spending the night in the hospital with mom and karoline she was in my belly keeping me company .
the nurses would n't let me sleep in the room with mom .
instead i made do with two hospital waiting room chairs .
i had company for a while that was much appreciated .
at around 6 in the morning one of the head nurses came in and told me i needed to make a decision .
there was no coming back and mom needed to go .
i spent a lot of time in that room by myself with my mom .
asking her how i was going to get through this .
each time i talked she would squeeze my hand .
that night she did tell me she loved me and trae and sebastian .
when mom finally went family was there but from that moment on through planning what to do next i felt alone .
yes i 'm aware family and friends are there for support but you ca n't replace that emptiness .
i still get a little jealous of those that still have their mother 's .
i get jealous when i see grandmother 's spending time with their grandbabies .
maybe that 's why i do n't spend a lot of time on here .
i 'm still a little bitter at the fact that i do n't have that .
while i know it 's not the negative that you 're supposed to focus on that 's what i focus on .
it 's not all the time but it is a lot of the time .
i know all of the positive comments and the advice you get when dealing with this kind of loss .
i know all of the answers and everything that everyone says .
sometimes you just want someone to not say anything .
sometimes i 'm grasping for that motherly advice that i desperately miss .
if i ask so many questions or if i am too quiet it 's all for the same reason i do n't have a mom to go to .
now that i 'm coming up on the two year mark i probably wo n't post as much about this in the future .
if it gets buried in your facebook feed that 's okay too .
hi could you please take a few mins out of your time to kindly answer my epq questionnaire .
i had done one a couple of months ago and from the feedback i have modified my question layout .
please answer sensibly as i will need to use it for my epq essay
my trial ended a few days ago i signed up before i moved out of my old house.. not sure if that has anything to do with this.. idk if it has to do with my ip.. but just super confused and i plan on buying it..
legally speaking i deleted the program due to fear of being charge or getting a bill ... but i wanted to know if this was normal .
there 's literally one other person in the cinema besides my friend and my younger brother was expecting it to be packed aus

i 'm a rtl-sdr researcher and dsp learner currently working on a project for properly figuring rtl2832 and i/q fundamentals out .
the project is about reading raw i/q samples processing samples and creating fft graph from them .
i tried to explain what i 'm doing in detail with comment lines .
i 'm hoping that i will be helpful to rtl-sdr beginners with this rtl\_map c project .
another purpose of the rtl\_map project is making a frequency scanner application for signal security researches .
another information about the project installation instructions and example usages exist at the github repository .
i 'd be thankful for comments about the project contributions with pull requests and new ideas .
i figured this would be a good community to consult .
do any of you remember the funyuns bag in the 1980s having an illustration of two children a boy and a girl both popping some funyuns into their mouths ?
i always said that i was going to get this image tattooed on my back if i could just find the image .
the problem is that i can find a single image of this on the internet anywhere .
it 's quite possible that i 'm just not that good of an internet sleuth or maybe my mind just made up the whole kids eating funyuns on the back of the bag .
does anyone remember this or know where i can find this image that has driven me bonkers trying to find for 15 years ever since i wanted to get a tattoo of it ?
so i might be late to the party but i did a search and found nada .
basically the other night we were doing some treasure maps and after opening the chest we got to play what can only be described as ffxiv play your cards right .
with every correct guess your loot increases and i had my guys screaming higher ! ''
got to the 4 and that was enough for us ... we take chances but at a total of 15mil worth of minions we stuck !

all i really listen to is drumcode-esque techno i know how shameful and i still like it despite how many on this sub do n't but i 'm interested in hearing what you guys consider to be actual techno .
i 'd say im into more of the heavy stuff i like the tribal-like techno very much into acid techno but ill give anything a listen so if you guys could recommend some mixes songs and playlists it would be greatly appreciated !
this teacher does not teach me and never will she teaches french while i take spanish .
i was recently apprehended for something i did n't do but my friend who looks like me and is abroad atm did .
i am afraid she will find me and things would happen .
i have already moved where i sit during lunchtimes .
my locker is where she teaches too so i 've decided to limit going there .
i do n't want either of us to get in trouble and i think she 'll forget about it later .

i saw a stardust chart that told me everything i gain above level 30 pokemon is marginal and not really worth it besides bragging etc .
stardust since i never upped a single pokemon ever .
i am now thinking if i should maybe do it ?

should i max some pokemon out or just keep saving until stardust can buy better things than level upgrades ?

every single time i fell in love it was so passionate it overwhelmed me in every way .
none of my relationships lasted more than 2 years and in a way they 've all been quite chaotic as i was always drawn to those artsy type of guys who loved mind games and i rarely fell for someone who gave me a deep sense of security .
it was either a really toxic guy who would n't care about me or a completely controlling and jealous type of male i thought jealousy=love .
looking back on my background and history of growing up in a fairly cold surroundings one parent alcoholic other workaholic and being sexually assaulted as a teen i made a connection and sought for help .
for the past two years i 've been in therapy and i 'm slowly figuring out that maybe if i ever chose to be in a long term relationship because i want it it will have to be a choice made with my head not with my heart '' .
my heart almost goes into overdrive when i fall for someone and always these people embody the characteristics of either one of my abusers .
so i have been thinking about a companionship as a start .
i am honestly ashamed and scared every time i like someone because my fear of dating another emotionally distant/unstable person freaks me out so i 'd rather stay single but i 'd like to fall in love with the right person .
i do n't know how else to put it ...

i 'm using a sensei raw on macos mojave so far so good .
i 've installed steelseries engine 3 to set up some buttons .
i binded the left two buttons to the macos specific forward and back buttons but they do n't seem to work in safari in some of my dev tools they are now working to navigate but not convinced if those tool just make use of mouse 4 and 5 .
but it 's not only safari also other browser do n't like it .
i also set the button right under the mouse wheel to open mission control but also does n't work .
it seems like macos somehow prevents steelseries engine 3 to take control of the mouse actions .
are there any settings i need to change to get it to work ?
yes i know i could use the magic mouse 2 i have one but it 's pain in the ass even after years of using .
the sensor is bad it feels bad it 's not precise .
it does n't even work well on many mousepads .
just saying everythig is up2date i just installed the tools i rebooted i save settings again tried all so far .
i do n't have any other macos related issues reported here .
i feel like it 's a bug with steelseries engine .
i opened a ticket at steelseries had a chat with an employee he was friendly but could n't help me either .

why not make a set bonus for some newbie item for example
obviously the bonus would work only with all 4 items equipped .
bonuses should be minor but they should be there to make things interesting .
we reached another nice round number 10 millions matches were tracked by our users .
heretics are more hated than heathens more people died fighting in the european wars of religion catholic vs. protestant than died in the crusades christian vs. muslim .
the narcissism of small difference is the notion that group members can hate a dissimilar insider more than they hate a similar outsider .
this could result in a score distribution that looks more like the uncanny valley than a normal distribution .
would this a severe impact on score voting elections ?
is it possible to use the rest api to pass customer orders to another store and if so how do i do that ?
for example when a consumer places an order from store x i want all the order details to automatically show up in store x and store y with all the relevant details in both stores e.g .
laptop has 256gb ssd and i have an external 2tb hdd .
i never store any data like pictures/music/videos/tv series on my laptop .
one day i was torrenting a very large file somewhere around 100gb .
i left my house to go eat returned back and everything seemed fine .
when i touched my hdd it was hot as hell .
i used my terminal linux to check the temperature and there was no temperature sensors on the hdd .
should i torrent to my ssd and then transfer to my hdd drive ?
i think the constant write/read will overheat the hdd .
the hdd works fine but is it safe to use ?
edit why do n't i ever keep stuff on my ssd ?
well i 'm changing my distribution every couple of months so this is less of a hassle .
i was playing origins a few days ago got the upgraded ice staff and the thunder fists ... except the thunder fists sort of mixed together with the ice staff 's melee which made it a 1 hit over round 20 the youtube link to the clip
i have n't gotten the thunder fists on bo3 with an upgraded staff before so idk if this is part of the game ...
my job is n't too unbearable it is well paying and has great opportunity and progression but is not at all rewarding .
is it worth trying to find something more enjoyable however may pay less ?
or keep up the grind knowing fire will come ?

im playing archer right now and its feeling the most boring shit ever in tera the dps is indeed good as i read on other posts but the fact that the massive dmg comes from my charge skills or just super long cast makes the gameplay feel so damn boringggg .

if i do move to a new char any recommendantions ?

anyone successfully using esphomelib and a mq-135 gas sensor ?
currently i have mine installed using the analog pin and using the adc platform
after calibration this spits out a value ... .but not the correct value of 400 ppm .
a second way to do it is using a 3rd party library called mq135.h https github.com/georgk/mq135 if i use this library and flash the esps directly the sensors are a lot more accurate ... but this bypasses the esphomelib system .
my question is how do i incorporate the mq135.h library into esphomelib ?
i started going through this https esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/components/sensor/custom.html ? highlight=sensor but i want to make sure i 'm on the right track before wasting a bunch of time trying to figure it out .
i have been using deliveroo with plus membership for more than a month yesterday i found out that they added min 10 per order even when you paid for membership .
i was using it a lot because 10 a month is not bad and can spend like 5-6 per meal so same as going out for eating .
now they added min per order and my lazy-ass have to start thinking about alternatives .

i 'm going to ask a quite vague question apologies if this is the wrong place for this .
a few months ago i heard a short piece https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=omsjln6tndy that was oddly distinctive enough that i matched it instantly to the very short horn opening in the waltz of the flowers https youtu.be/0arjsjm8dgs ? t=87 at 1:27 conductor here https imgur.com/a/wj4kok3 .
this was the first time i 've felt like this not to mention that the last time i had listened to it was more than 10 years ago .
i 've been trying to narrow down the theory behind it but my music classes were a long time ago all i can tell from the conductor is that this is a regular major chord in a a c e some notes are exchanged in the two pieces .
is there any significance behind it being used like this ?
any other clues or maybe analyses of this part of the nutcracker i can read ?
you also live in a high voter fraud state .
does anyone know if there is a roadmap somewhere or where one can write feature suggestions ?
while i do think it 's a good tdm map and do n't want it removed from there it 's much better as a onslaught map .
it 's one of the few large capture point maps and requires more skill and provides a good challenge for a lot of players .
it does n't have to be removed from tdm just add it back to onslaught as well

i know seizure auras are different for everyone but i 'm wondering what they 're like how frequent they are for others .
are your auras fairly consistent or is there a roulette of different symptoms you feel each time ?
though i 'm not sure if 3 is an aura ?
a few times a year i 'll feel extremely emotional have random confusing thoughts often recurring for 20-30 secs .
these are often crippling i 'm unable to focus or distract myself .
almost every time a petit mal seizure will follow within 1-2 minutes .
every week or 2 i 'll have a brief emotional mood swing .
i have a coherent thought process just overly emotional/anxious when something comes up .
see guy trying to get in my lane on hwy feel weird/guilty that he 's not in my lane where he wants to be .
does n't immediately lead to seizures but i 'm more likely to have one in the next few days .
every few days when seizure-free or multiple times a day if i 've had recent seizures just have a tingling feeling around my jaw line or the back of my head can go on for a few minutes or linger for up to an hour .
have n't noticed a link with these upcoming seizures .
i 'm a relatively new player having played 1.0 a bit with friends .
i recently learned about 2.0 and it sparked my interest again .
but i 'm not well-versed in the star wars universe so i 'm getting a little confused as to which factions and subfactions can/should be flown together .
are rebel alliance and resistance part of the same faction ?
and are galactic empire first order and galactic republic part of the same faction ?
last year i finished a ya fantasy and last summer began querying .
i paid a published author for a developmental edit and she did a pretty good job as far as i can tell and i tried to use most of her advice and edited using her notes and suggestions .
i also became a part of a writers group which was created on twitter after a writing contest and received feedback/critique for the first fifty pages or so from some of my group members .
after querying about 25-30 agents i 'm not really sure what to do .
it seems that they all agree that i have a strong/great/exciting premise but they are all having a difficult time connecting with my protagonist .
one of my dream agents even loved my pitch on a twitter pitch contest and was very excited to read my pages but she said my protagonist had no personality beyond what she had to to do to drive the story forward and that made it very difficult to connect with her .
so this seems to be a huge and recurring problem in my personalized query rejections .
what 's driving me crazy is deep down i understand this but i have no idea how to fix it .
for example here is something an agent from writer 's house sent me after requesting a partial
i was hoping protagonist 's name own desires and dreams would drive the action of the story.
it 's like these agents are reading my query and are so pumped to read the pages but then it 's like ... darn !
it 's not what i was hoping expecting etc .
but now i feel stuck and not sure how to move forward with an close but not quite there yet '' manuscript .

i was the interim manager of a coffee shop in a college town that had a local hometown hero who went on to have a very successful career in the nfl .
i say interim manager because the gm of this location quit abruptly and i as the senior shift manager was waiting for the interview process to move along before i was officially made to be gm of the store but for all intents and purposes i was the manager at the time of this ... incident .
so weekday opening shift at this coffee shop right across the street from the main part of the university 's campus .
i have two employees call in sick leaving only myself and a new hire to operate the store until around noon when someone else is available to come in .
before we unlock the doors and open up shop i print out an apologetic note and tape it to the door which says something along the lines of we 're sorry for the inconvenience but your coffee may take a little longer than usual this morning as we are short-staffed .
please be patient so we can make certain that everyone has a great morning . ''
the first hour and a half or so goes by without issue .
i have the new lady working the pos and taking orders/marking cups and i 'm making all of the drinks which she has n't been around long enough to learn to make correctly and confidently .
then the morning people-on-their-way-to-work rush begins and a line quickly forms that leads from the counter all the way back to the entrance .
i had anticipated this hence the sign i made and posted .
this guy is the hottest thing to ever come out of this small nowhere town .
he had since retired from the nfl and he and his family bought and lived in a really large tacky house on the outskirts .
while both he and his wife did a lot of good things charity-wise with their money they both had a reputation in the local service industry for being nightmare customers .
i heard countless stories from friends in retail and restaurant jobs of verbal abuse from both of them .
so this guy let 's call him john doe is several people back in line .
the new employee on the register is doing her best to be quick and thorough stopping to ask me questions every few minutes to be certain things are entered correctly and people are being served at a pretty decent clip to my best judgement all things considered but john starts crossing his arms checking his watch and sighing loudly to show his displeasure i mean really making a show of it .
then after a few minutes have passed and his dramatic display has n't been addressed he pipes up loudly and says ma'am how smart do you have to be to take an order for a cup of coffee ? !
some of us have real work to get to .
do you think you can pick up the pace ? ! ''
the new employee is frozen like a deer in headlights .
everyone in line with john seems to be as well .
i know who you are and i do n't care .
if you want to talk to people like that then you can go do it some place else .
we 're working hard to help everyone as fast as we can .
you can wait in line patiently with everyone else or you can skip your morning latte and go straight to your real work . ''
john doe gives me his best murder stare but keeps his place in line and i go back to making drinks .
he finally gets up to the counter and my coworker nervously takes his order and writes it on the cup .
now i do n't know if he told her to do this or if she just did it out of fear or respect but the name written on the side of his cup was mr. doe '' .
generally people 's names on the cup are steve claire bob vanessa ... you know .
i made it to the best of my ability walked to the end of the counter and loudly said john !
john came grabbed his coffee without looking at me and left .
as soon as he was out the door there was a small applause from a handful of customers at the cafe tables .
so i have been seeing lots of posts suggesting training manuals are a real issue for some people .
they have never been a bottle neck for me in fact do n't think i have ever really been aware of them .

my husband reads to me every night before we go to sleep .

yeah that 's pretty much what i figured i think though that the advent of social media has skewed this a lot though and not in a good way as there 's always almost instant acceptance of any accusation and condemnation of the accused which is given a huge amount of prominence unmatched by any stories of the accused 's innocense and condemnation of the false accuser if it turns out to be baseless .
name me one accusation that hit the headlines that was covered with as much prominence when it failed to hit the courts or was proven to be false .
in fact the uk as one example has anonymity laws in place to ensure the accuser will never be named regardless of whether they 've made the whole thing up .
but that 's my point by saying we will make sure we investigate this thoroughly it 's not saying that the accuser is disbelieved it 's actually giving them confidence that their voice will be heard .
this would also discourage any false accusations these are in the minority but they have a disproportionate affect on how the next genuine accuser is received or how they feel they are heard .
but the issue is that a huge number of people automatically believe it instead of thinking i wonder how that will play out ? the old no smoke without fire school of thought .
is that just human nature or is it because we like the lavicious ?
it took my dad a few years before he fully accepted me but he still loved me it 's so wonderful to have supportive and loving parents like you .

robo 's exact math is that even after the federal tax credits expire wind will be 2 ‚Äì 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour large-scale solar will be 2.5 ‚Äì 3 cents and storage will add .5 ‚Äì 1 cent .
this would put these resources slightly below the current cost of natural gas-fired generation without the uncertainty around fuel prices that is inherent to gas .
pv+storage cheaper than replacing existing natural gas or cheaper than new gas plants ?
also wind pv and storage rapidly become cheaper every year so there 's not much of an excuse any more ...

if this is 100 fact and russia 100 rigged elections in the us to sway votes in his direction and russia made 4 million democrats in 2008 not vote in 2016 then i 'll agree with you .
i guess you need to change your logo when people learn you have a pattern of anti-semitism and racism .
nah with some practice you can make it pretty subtle i 've been doing it for years now .
if you 're confident enough you can even tell them what you 're doing and they 'll appreciate it if they already know then it 's not even awkward .
i 'm using a sacrosanct list so i wo n't be using a lord-aquilor anyway .
plus i use allied reavers tge aelven ones so i feel like i have a lot of annoying ranged units already
within the us sure but if they actually traveled outside the us and saw how crazy the rest of the world can be they would n't be so americentric about everything .
if you 're doing it for more charitable reasons anything under 5/10 is good however those here who confidentially loan probably do anywhere from 15 up
trainers you now have the chance to encounter a shiny regice in raids !
i 'd like to see more reviews like this .
been arrested 4 times and they have all been overall pleasant experiences .
this is me i was diagnosed with pmdd a few years ago when my doctor let me know that feeling depressed and suicidal is n't exactly normal before your period .
it 's stupid because you would think that if you know it 's just hormones influencing you you could sort of tune it out but that shit is soooo real !
at least that 's how it was when i needed it .
well yes my leg is n't an actual cannon .
i would n't be able to run pass weak defenders prob like yourself so easily then .
does the same to me still have the winter stuff though so i know it 's working .
has the house even been in session since the shutdown bill was signed ?
this is making me think that the lack of worker protections has led to a lot of the angst around metoo and sexual harassment .
a worker is given no due process before they can be fired .
so a woman reports harassment and she has some rights due to laws and legal precedents .
the man only has as many rights as the company allows him generally speaking .
this is n't the woman 's doing but she bears onus of 'ruining ' someone 's life because they company finds it easier to fire him than to do an investigation .
in a union he would have power and representation .
i agree with you i 'm just interested to read another take on that .
rowling has said herself that lily could have fallen in love with snape if not for his interest in the dark arts
i just always thought that it 's not entirely impossible that she could 've had a somewhat crush on him at least at some point after all he was the one who introduced her to the world of magic and they were close for a very long time .
that 's why i wanted to see another scenario to that through a fanfic and maybe why things would n't have worked out for the two of them .
i meant that i want it to be based on canon events as much as possible no crossovers no switching houses no time travel .
they need converts no one wants to join a church that is 3 hours long .
the home study is just the excuse they are feeding the tbm 's .
they ca n't say ... hey no one is joining our church we are desperate for converts so we are going to a 2 hour block and see if that works .
i was wrong you admitted that you were wrong once when it turned out that something positive you thought about oculus was n't true .
can you think of a time when you admitted you were wrong when it did n't line up with your narrative ?
you do n't know how much this helps and i appreciate it cus i do n't have time to try every combo
my thoughts were that while it 's somewhat plausible that it 's simply uncommon .
moreover most people are n't widowed retired grandparents at 56yo .
you follow the rules unless there is a queue .
if there are free urinals always choose the furthest .
if there is no other option and there are dividers or there is another person waiting after you you may be forgiven for using an unavailable urinal one that 's next to one that 's in use .
stepping on a rake could probably end in a concussion or at least a broken nose .

trump does n't own the sotu he can deliver it by letter anytime he wants and there 's no time limit on when he can do it .
he can even tweet it since he prefers that forum .
tell your boss to quit being such a whiny crybaby has n't he caused enough trouble for one month ?
the spawn rate was terrible even with incense and lures .
game boys are digital too they do n't even have a dedicated sound chip .
get a copy of lsdj and try it in a gameboy emulator see if it works for you .
daw with a few choice vst can work as well but you have to know what you 're doing in terms of sound and polyphony .
i have tried both and i found the lsdj route easier the sound is always cohesive even if it does n't always sound good .
also i really like the interface for entering notes especially if you 're using a lot of pitch bends and vibratos .
not only that but the national assembly can declare he has abandoned his post and/or the popular revocation of his mandate .
anything is possible at this point in regards to any project announcement .
really wish the tour would happen as well as the short film
i was in homeroom my senior year and i watched it happen .
i was referring to the fact that both the extension and the bit are also dewalt .
how would you raise a military with no taxes and no deficit spending ?
100 give it a clean in iso and then a rinse in soap and water .
i feel like it should be the closing credits track it 's a bit too melancholy and on the nose to be used in the actual film .
the founder of ikea was one of the richest men on the planet .
he still drove a ‚Äò70s volvo lived in a 200k home and shopped for clothes at second hand stores .
ive 8 gig i run modern games like mh world no problem .
but tbh my 350 pc i built specificaly to shit on my friends who claim you have to pay 1k to 4k to play modern games at good fps and setting im like nah yall just stupid and like to waste money .
also all my parts were bought new also my gfx card when bought 2 years ago cost me 113 its now around 330 fuckin hell
yes so spirited charge is i was under the impression it just upped damage dice similar to lead blades spell not all damage .
his passing is below average he ca n't keep up with the quick passes we do .
werner is a pace merchant who belongs in a counter attacking team .
can confirm that fox larynxes are indeed upside down .
dragonaut just came to mind first for me probably because i 've covered it a few times .
p.s. do n't cover dragonaut at a doom show because the band before you will do it too .
origin and ubi both do certain things better than steam .
upoints are great getting extra 15 on games for getting achievements ?
origin probably has the best customer service of them all .
the big thing for me when i 'm not feeling motivated to do my studies is breaking tasks into tiny tiny pieces .
i need to read my art history chapter but i do n't want to and the chapter is long .
so i say i could just do a page '' .
if a page still feels too long i say to myself i will read one paragraph of one page and if it feels too much i will take a 5 minute break and continue '' .
99 of the time by the time i finish the paragraph i think that was n't so bad i can read another paragraph '' and i continue until i really feel ready like a break .
before i know it i 've been studying for an hour !
it seems dumb but giving yourself permission for frequent breaks tricks your brain into feeling like it is more manageable .
i also have a pomodoro timer app on my phone which helps a lot too !

resubmitting a removed post without prior moderator approval can result in a ban .
and there 'll be dozens of people to replace you .
that 's what you guys do n't understand they 've figured out that there 's more people that the redesign will attract than the old design will keep .
if reddit loses every single current user that came on before the redesign but they 're all replaced by people that love the redesign and they keep gaining people they 'll have really lost nothing .
it might take a while for those numbers to creep back up but that 's why old.reddit is still available .
they 're keeping you here until there 's enough people to replace you then they 'll tell you to fuck off by shutting down the old website .
you could leave before then and they still would n't care .
i would feel that i was back in uni living in a sharehouse again lol
using your lean mass so much requires energy transportation cellular repair .
your ldl is your fat energy 's emergency cholesterol 's ride share .
chewie was literally in another star system cos he hyperspaced away after dropping rey off at the supremacy .
but maybe he came back and did a frontal assault on the entire first order fleet who knows .
then somehow missed the hyperfrag then noticed snoke 's shuttle leaving the supremacy knew it was n't snoke and did n't shoot it rendezvoused somehow in space and under fire from first order remnants took rey on board ditched the shuttle then flew down to crait
but we did n't need to see it because uh
i always refer to his human form as ganondorf since that 's how he introduces himself in the game .
all the games where he has a human form seem to reserve ganon '' for his monster form .
i 'd agree if it was over 18 when they 're an adult .
but even then it 's still the parents house .
if they were n't the parents who would take it from their kids and use it they 'd be the parents to just throw it in the trash .
and they are n't doing it just to be shitters they 're doing it to teach their kid not to bring it into their house .
or at the very least to hide it better .
i have a 2010 camaro ss and they do n't make snow tires for it .
i 'm this guy if ever i get caught out when it snows .
one important thing is the definition of winning '' within the context of warframe .
i 'm weird and spiritual and think our ancestors visit us in the form of animals .
it 's possible uncle frank just wanted to say hi .
i feel like my ancestors have visited me in the form of owls and bucks and maybe even a bear i encountered back in may
i would like to add imo spring snow can stand alone as a novel with great power and beauty .
even though it is part one of a tetralogy it ends in such a way that you could treat it as a self-contained novel .
i say this as someone who has just finished reading through the whole tetralogy .
the later books add to the story and make you look at the first book in new ways but i would say that you could read and enjoy spring snow without feeling obligated to read the other three books as well or at least bit straight away ! ! !
you could always ssh to something properly secured within the network and then from there ssh to unraid .
that 's what i 've done in the past .
from my understanding a limited slip is a little more tail happy .
my open diff feels very balanced and easy to control .
i never drove one with a limited slip hard enough to really tell the difference .
also from a daily driving point of view the overall gearing in 5th is a tad taller than the overall gearing in 6th for a 6 speed car .
plus you get the option of swapping in a 3.90 limited slip in the future and getting even taller gearing if you want to go that route .
either factory option is geared much more for spirited driving and it 's a bit buzzy at 80 mph on the highway .
termies did n't do much but my dreadnoughts power fist smashes everything with my librarian budding him i actually recorded it and plan on uploading it soon https i.imgur.com/z43ipcs.jpg https i.imgur.com/pnkjblc.jpg

my son learned to cook in part to get a break from having to clean up after dinner
sometimes wish i would have been more into it when i was younger !
i loved the cars he built but never followed it more than an interest .
but i feel they brought him in too early in the playthrough .
i think his arrival should have been slightly delayed a bit especially in the b scenarios .
i also think there should have been a few more scripted events where he bashes through walls or such .
i think they absolutely should have given him a randomized seed as to what areas are safezones from him .
imo what saverooms/rooms are safe from him should be seeded randomly so on replaying the game you 'll always be on edge .
i 'd like to see him crush the door to a saveroom pick up the typewriter and try to beat you to death with it .

i do n't want to say that the real estate attorney side is worse but it 's pretty bad over here too .
in addition to the general public dislike agents do n't like the whole speaking truth to commissions sort of thing and other attorneys think that we 're not really practicing law .
i went to the shriners hospital and they were completely amazing .
i had the pointed toes they loosened my achilles tendon .
i was in a cast for 6 weeks but was n't inpatient lived in british columbia went to the hospital in portland or .
my shoulder 's tight but we were also told that the botox screwed up the strength i 'd have so we opted out .
i was 8 years old when i got my last surgery from the shriners 27 now and i sometimes need to wear a brace but mostly when i 've overdone it the day before .
my doctor also recently sent me a clip of myself a year after surgery at the gait lab .
it 's also pretty crazy how good your body/subconscious is at keeping you alive .
in high school i almost got hit in the head with a discus and i turned around to see it about 6 feet from me .

hey i saw your old thread from your journey to collect every dune racer .
if so how much did it cost all together ?
i had to google what u were talking about because i 'm an ot guy .
im not quite there yet on putting racing stripes on my ties .
i usually roll with at least two different types of weapons depending mostly on combat range and whether or not i have a desire for stealth .
but you 're going to need something a bit quicker for dealing with hordes of melee beasts .
apart from the generic traits that are shared with loads of other actors he just does n't have the presence .
in punisher the first time we see him straight away i could have told you he was shady .
fuck my x sounds like a jet engine now and i really do n't want to have to do this..
is there any step by step guides around for this ?
in a way we 've had so many conversations over the past year about our relationship that i do n't even know if there will be a lot to talk about .
he will probably try and talk me out of it i think but we 've been through that cycle of one of us being pretty much at the point of break up and then talking each other out of it a few times before so i really just want this to be me having made a decision and telling him what it is .
which is another thing that would make it a hard trip if i went over to him to do it since i do n't really want to talk it out heaps .
