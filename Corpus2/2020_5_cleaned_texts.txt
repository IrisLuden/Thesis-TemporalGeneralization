basically i want you to play as a pregnant woman who i would worship .
i wan na worship your belly breasts butt back everywhere on your sexy pregnant body .
and praise you for the femininity and beauty you 're radiating .
i 'd like this to be more wholesome and cute rather than kinky .
maybe even add breastfeeding if you 're into it .
in the house or out in public like in a cafe or something .
so i recently had a suicide scare where a hotline ended up sending the cops to my house and my therapist suggested i do a partial hospitalization program .
it 's all online bc of covid and i 'm about to start my 4th day and i 'm really not feeling it .
the groups feel like a watered down crash course version of the dbt group i was in before quarentine which i also struggled with mixed with cbt .
i 'm really having trouble keeping up with the pace and i come out of each day just feeling more hopeless and suicidal .
i 'm really trying to buy into the program and learn the skills but it just does n't feel helpful .
whenever i ask questions in group they either do n't know an answer and try to defer to the group for ideas and we just sit in silence or they misunderstand it and start going on a completely different train of thought than me and then when i try to elaborate on my question they just talk over me .
i do n't feel the social support of knowing i 'm not alone like they say it provides because everyone else seems to get it and buy into it so i just feel especially broken .
i tried to look up other peoples experiences online to see if there was anyone else who has done this type of program and felt like i do so i could maybe feel less alone and i could n't .
they said it was my call if i wanted to stop but that they want me to stay and i know my therapist wont be happy with me either if i leave the program so i do n't want to quit because i know that if i do i 'll be told i did n't give it a fair shot but it feels wrong to be taking a spot in this group that someone else that would actually benefit from it could have .
i need it for 4 gb ram dual core 1.5 gb e2-9000e cpu laptop
i mostly use chrome word and photoshop and watch some movies on it
if there 's a way to play x265 vids smoothly on this shitty pc it would be awesome its not that important tho
i checked some youtube vids and reddit posts and what i got is that there are some easy distros and some require experience .
tho i am new to this stuff i want something not so easy so it would help me gain some experience in using linux
i absolutely love the witcher universe from the books to the games and even the show and would not mind a prequel perhaps with a different witcher set in the same universe .
i 'm just wondering if cdpr could pull off a story with characters as deep as they are now with no book background .
so i could say rape four times and faggot two times and if i got over i would be arrested .
and i accidentally said rape five times and this big ungodly being squashed me then i woke up .
i heard ie 230 with hunter is really difficult and i was in 330 at first but then i switched out so now idk if i should take 230 and 330 at the same time or ...
my mind can not handle organizing items that all look the same 😭 i love to mix-and-match
enthusiastic cause i found some new friends on reddit and also having a happy morning with a cup of good coffee
we 're strictly told that we ca n't spoil the ending not even express our thoughts in other channels in order not to mess up with other western baboons ' reading experience .
though i 'm pretty sure that some dark horses will update the words in wikia or any other spoiler website .
btw cuttlefish sama said that his own conclusion and message to all baboons will be posted tomorrow .
then he will have a 2 to 3 day rest and write down some side stories around some characters .

pretty common problem thanks to a windows 10 update but idk where else to go with it since everything i 've tried fails .
the quick rundown is that my microphone has static that i can not get rid of .
all of the youtube tutorials that i have looked up to fix it have told me to go to settings system sound sound control panel recording then double click my microphone and there should be an enhancements '' tab and options to rid of the static and extra noise .
i 've been told that i should uninstall and reinstall my realtek audio drivers and the tab should appear .
problem is the only drivers that i have listed in the device manager are amd high definition audio device and high definition audio device which i have removed and added several times .
i 've been trying to get into streaming so having this issue is really driving me up the wall because who wants to hear that nonsense ?
sorry for the wall of text but i feel like this is an issue that needs a lot of explaining .
for the premier pro three extra controllers and 3 phone clips is less than the 1tb ps4 pro
i was thinking of subs and torpedo cruiser spam to get insane amounts of torpedoes .
it 's been a while since my emotions went unchecked .
i 've just been writing when i 'm sad .
otherwise i 'd lurk instead of saying what needs to be said .
but i told myself that i was better than that .
and i 'd rather forgive myself for the harsh thing i say when i 'm upset .
at least i did n't hurt anyone 's feelings today .
the last time i argued with someone i felt dead inside .
i felt like it was hopeless because they just were n't hearing me .
but i know that i 'm getting somewhere good because i have n't been using bad ways to cope .
i 'm still moody and i still do n't express myself .
the last thing i wrote in my journal was it 's okay. and when i saw that today i felt like the last few months were n't in vain .
but i did n't feel like getting my journal to write .
if you do n't mind me asking how have you changed in the past few months ?
i 'm looking for someone willing to sell me fish bait dm me with any offers .
so i 'm pregnant and i know that i 'm pregnant but i can not go to a clinic right now because of the covid .

on tiktok there is this account the hive house as in bee hive and im a bee in a group chat on snapchat .
my friend asked us if we wanted to do what we did .
so we were talking they were odd but fun then one of the bees changed the name so that bees are better .
we took over the chat and then i left the group .
i do n't get the point behind it for some reason and it 's making me feel really dumb .
not sure if this is the right sub but this community seems to be a lot nicer than most on reddit so here goes ...
i got a letter from my doctor 's office saying they will be leaving their practice soon and i have an appointment scheduled with them before their last day .
would it be okay of me to give them a thank you '' card and maybe a gift card to a coffee shop ?
they 're the first doctor i 've had that i felt 100 comfortable with since they actually listened to my concerns and answered all my stupid '' questions without any judgement .
i want to show my appreciation for the care they 've given me over the last few years i just do n't want it to be a weird goodbye .
after kamina died i just didnt want to watch .
to explain this better i have two friends i 've known for over a decade and one of them is extremely racist and toxic but the other one was influenced by this racist one our culture and society to believe certain racist ideals like light skinned people in our african country being more attractive .
i was honestly really upset at how they said to me 'you 're pretty for a brown skinned girl ' .
they were also both super insecure and kept projecting and talking about their insecurities and it was making me uncomfortable .
i was done when they made me go very early to a place with no restaurants opening before 3 pm when they knew that and i spent so much money having to take a cab here and there .
we then went to a restaurant they did n't like bc one of them kept saying she wanted to choose where to go from the day before yet did n't decide and asked me where we should go this is the racist rude one who i do n't think i ever want to speak to again .
i stormed off and was so mad that day .
i blocked them both and vowed to never talk to either one ever again .
sometimes she 'd bully me when we were 12 but she never hurt me deeply or anything .
she was just friends with my bully and still is though but she still treated me nicely for a long time .
she was always really extroverted and socially smarter than i am so sometimes it caused issues like her wanting to hang out with other people she thought were cooler/she could study with better etc .
i do n't blame her though as sometimes i just ca n't offer these things .
anyway i messaged her on an impulse and do n't know what to say .
if i try this zero tolerance thing again on her it 'll just be me being potentially toxic/rude/acting immature by cutting someone off the moment they do something wrong to me .
at the same time it 's the only way i 've learned to protect my feelings from being hurt .
ok so i just got out of a huge cave and i wanted to know if anyone had any tips for exploring the caves ?

i ca n't wait for them to add more buildings so i can get a 99 1 star .
had gone 5 whole days w/o sleep until i had to go to the hospital for the doctor to prescribe me sleeping pills .
on day three or four every single part of my body just hurt especially my jaw because i was basically eating three meals per day for at least three whole days without sleeping to rest my jaw or any other part of my body .
it was the worst possible experience in my entire life i would n't wish what i felt on my worst enemy .
i play using thumbs and the earphones now have either a crackling sound or one of the earbuds ca n't emit sound .
this usually happens either when flick notes appear or long sliders that slide across the screen .
i 'm going to start using a new pair of earphones soon which any info on how to not break them so fast is appreciated !
what are the advantages compared to other similar products ?
i know it 's probably quality as i mainly use nvidia gpus but what are its unique features ?
i saw this on facebook and it 's everywherea thoughts ?
you are invited to check out and enjoy my sister 's podcast eating after midnight '' which will focus on the 80 's movies we enjoyed growing up .
first movie reviewed is footloose the movie where kevin bacon uses the power of dance to bring the freedom of rock and roll to an oppressive southern town .
my lease is up in about 7 weeks in a related building .
i hear that some buildings are offering free months right now .
do i have a chance at negotiating a rent reduction ?
fwiw i 've been a tenant for over 8 years and have always paid on time .
i 've fallen behind on my conquest guides and i regret that fact greatly but i have been asked my thoughts on general lineups .
so since i am a man of strong opinions i shall offer them .
this is because tier-2 generals and princesses are both very powerful as it were .
indeed the marginal utility of for example dombrowski over golitsyn or suvorov over dobeln is of one skill defense art and formation respectively .
indeed i 'd argue most of the premium geneals have a superior non-premium counterpart .
the three that do n't have close counterparts are the hybrids davout lannes and poniatowski .
if you 're playing the 6-general lineup you may have use for a hybrid but the fact is that having one hybrid general buying embelms for poniatowski davout or lannes is not as good as having two more generals so if it 's either the one iap hybrid or having more slots it 's the latter .
this earlier analysis may have led you to think i really like princesses .
your endgame lineup for any number of slots will contain three princesses at least and could easily contain more .
sophia isabela lan victoria and kate are all exquisite and even sakurako and fatimah have their place .
maria may be a bit of a tosser but you can get a little use out of her if you did n't buy an infantry general .
all in all i believe princesses are the backbone of every good lineup .
this brings us to the next point do n't buy artillery generals .
you can get one powerful artillery general sophia using most 5-star countries and one cavalry general .
you can get a second isabela using one cavalry general sophia and an artillery trainer kutaisov/gazan in france 1798 .
all told you can have two powerful artillery generals before you finish coalition/imperial eagle if you set your mind to it .
since in a 6-general lineup you 're likely gon na have only two artillery generals you 're covered .
no need to buy scharnhorst marmont grouchy or yermolov .
now that we 've said this the next point follows quite elegantly your first general should be cavalry .
artillery as we covered will be princesses and i think we can all agree that cavalry is more powerful than infantry which leads to the logical conclusion that you should buy a cavalry general .
golitsyn with his skills and his 5-stars is a powerhouse .
dumouriez is the opposite he 's cheap and a trainer but with 4 stars and surprise he 's weaker than the others .
each is expensive but less than golitsyn is a trainer has a strength sulkowski breaks forts raevsky is fast but is weaker than golitsyn .
dumouriez will be a little harder but you can work with any of them .
depending on what you do you will want lan isabela and 2 of sophia victoria and golitsyn .
the considerations depend on whether you play more campaign or conquest your favorite units and more .
any lineup with 4 in my opinion will be a struggle with some blind spot .
i recommend lan victoria sophia isabela and one more possibly a second cavalry or a jack-of-all-trades hybrid .
the last slot once the others are trained is for golitsyn .
of course if you 're playing with a hacked apk none of this applies to you .
but the nobel prize-winning economist amartya sen argued in 1981 that there should still have been enough supplies to feed the region and that the mass deaths came about as a combination of wartime inflation speculative buying and panic hoarding which together pushed the price of food out of the reach of poor bengalis .
state governments did n't want to export or donate grain to bengal those were run by native indians .
large amounts of aid were diverted to india although nowhere near enough as local indian governers initially refused and then were reluctant to give aid or even sell grain and the japanese conquering burma reduced available grain supplies by a huge degree .
there are many many bad people in british history who have done awful things but churchill at worst can be accused of misunderstanding the situation due to a lack of accurate information and when the full extent of the situation was known action was taken to relieve the famine .
comparing this to sticking people on trains and gassing them or intentionally starving entire ethnic groups is utterly disgusting .

i made a couple racks a few weeks ago and they turned out great but the bottoms were a bit crispy .
i did cook thyme over lump so the temp was definitely hotter and i do a better job of keeping the temp around 250 with brickettes .
maybe pour the hot pre lit coals to one side of the basket and hang the ribs on the other ?

i 'm asian and did n't even know this sub .
i started from scratch several times and been trying for weeks .
not only i get segmentation fault but it seems that some nodes and the file i used to load the dictionary are still available .
i 'm late but i wan na write something about this too .
i got hated in germany because i 'm bavarian and in europe because i 'm german .
everywhere are some dumb people who wan na hate you .
of course you can criticise a country but not a citizen for politics .
and i 'm bavarian so it 's nearly the same position .
at first we are bavarian or catalan then maybe spanish or german .
ok i 've to say in catalan the movement is much stronger and in bavaria there is n't really a movement but maybe you know it from football mia san mia we are we we are bavarians .
we hold together and we are proud to be bavarian !
and that can be for germans really conceited or arrogant .
germany is n't old and we had so many kingdoms so of course there are some groups which are more together and united .
i 'm really bored and i love hearing people 's stories about their ult biases !
i have two at the moment juyeon from the boyz and hwiyoung from sf9 these are also my first biases that are not leaders of the group haha
when you are trying to simulate a universe you have to leave out some details .
some details because of limitations of the system and some because you do n't fully understand your own universe .
if we are in a simulation then the mess physicists have to deal with is less detailed/complex than the universe above this level .

so i a m 25 noticed a pattern of behavior i have that i want to change because it is very toxic .
basically whenever i see something i do n't like my girl
friend doing or need to address i get very quiets and distant and today we had a big argument and it happened again that i got quiet and distant ... .
i 'm usually a very vocal person and address my issues so i do n't understand why this it 's so different with my s/o .
because it is a very childish quality for someone my age .
tldr i need to change my quiet distant behavior how do i change that .
i do n't know how is that related to meditation any how .
but i find myself more peaceful with myself and inner talk .
i had been developing two habits journaling my thoughts .
writing a lot about my thoughts and how i feel .
also i had been practicing meditation for quiet a while .
for a short period of time in the morning .
i am only focusing on my breath and observing my thoughts .
it 's quiet interesting because as for journaling i am questioning my anxiety and negative thoughts .
i am seeing the effects by letting my thoughts out and sharing with people .
i can not see the connection between meditation and my peacefulness .
merengue is in boxes as i moved in another villager via amiibo !
i would love some nmt or a mush lamp diy for her .

can he replace ebony maw to that extent that bo team would work in arena against bo on attack or other team would have too much advantage of having empowered thanos from start ?
since we 're in a pandemic and have to social distance i have started taking a lot of walks to get fresh air .
however i wanted to start noting down which roads i 've walked down so i can experience something new everyday .
is there any way to save a 15km x 15km section of google maps to print out and trace the roads i 've walked down ?
or is there another platform i can do this with ?
i have a 2001 4wd limited the only oem parts i can find are 100 amp .

where you 're flying and there 's pterodactyls around you .
it comes at a shitty time in oz.. they are not explaining the reasons behind nearly daily maintenance outages
right now i should be sleeping and instead i 'm obsessing over what would normally be a small problem to someone else .
i pray every day i get hit by a car or something .
shit i would n't even mind if i got the ol covid-19 .
i 'm too scared to kill myself because in reality it most likely wo n't even be successful .
i could end up brain damaged and suffering even worse than i am now for the rest of my life .
may updates na po ba college of educ regarding shifting and transferring requirements ?
i really love podcasts like my favorite murder the dollop and beach too sandy water too wet .
but i 'm pretty tired of them trashing on religion so hard .
i understand that a lot of the hosts have had bad experiences with religion and giving your opinion on it is your right but at some point it 's just a lot .
are there other podcasts that are maybe similar or nonfiction comedy adjacent that do n't the hosts do n't hate on others beliefs religious or otherwise so much ?
i still love all the podcasts and hosts that i mentioned do n't get me wrong but i 'm just looking for some recommendations
i 've watched season 1 and it 's really enjoyable .
5 teams set out to race from london to singapore without using airtravel .
the only money they have is what a plane ticket to singapore would cost .
before reaching singapore they have several pit stops to check in to .
this is solely focusing on the travel aspect as there are no roadblocks or additional tasks to do .
they are also encouraged to take local jobs to earn extra cash .
i 've heard that season 2 takes place in north to south america but i 'm not sure .
i have n't found a way to watch it yet .
just a tip if you are looking for a fun new series !

they want to make a big show and gang up on anyone they can .

hello i 'm a 14-year-old girl and i 've been learning to sing for about 3 years .
you might have heard me sing on this subreddit on a different account .
i recently remade some covers that i originally recorded as i was beginning to learn to sing and i thought about asking for some feedback now that i have so much time home alone every day and on the bright side of everything it seems like a great opportunity to improve .
here are a couple samples of my singing i just went in my bathroom and recorded .
the other one is a cover i recently remade for fun .
sorry for the low quality and broken smoke detector but i still think the audio still depicts the quality of my voice fairly accurately
i really hope this is the right place to ask and i 've looked a lot for answers on this sub and online before posting so please be kind .
has there been a change to how ads sniping works ?
i use tap and hold to ads and earlier it would work as required meaning i would hold the ads+shoot button and release it to shoot the ads would then close on its own allowing for better movement .
however after the update i think the moment you remove your finger and the sniper weapon shoots the ads remains open and does not close on its own it has to be closed manually .
this is not the case with other weapons like ars for example they work just fine and the ads auto-closes once i stop shooting .
is this a change made recently or can i revert it back ?
can someone please help me get it back to how it was before as this method makes sniping very clunky as you can not aim shoot and move quickly after .
i did try to change a few settings and search online for answers but could n't find anything specific .
thanks for any help and advice i can get !

behold the labour parties idea of equality to replace the selection criteria for judges to be based upon what you are not how qualified you are .
in the authors opening speech they note correctly that the scottish government are committed to increasing diversity in the legal profession .
every citizen should have the ability to become a judge and preside over the rule of law provided they are qualified .
and it is certainly also true that our courtrooms are not the most diverse but what we need is to create confidence and aspiration among misrepresented groups give every child confidence that nothing can hold them back in their dreams .
we need to make legal apprenticeships transparent and accessible and we need to have regard for how the legal profession is portrayed .
and finally we need to ensure that no discrimination occurs in appointments .
if we do all of this presiding officer i am fully confident that we shall turn around the statistics and have a competent and diverse legal system .
indeed the governments wide ranging education reforms mean we are well on our way to ensuring that every child starts with equality or opportunity and a great education that can enable them to each the tops of their profession whatever they choose .
but what this bill does is none of that alas .
it buts the cart before the horse instead of working to create true equality of opportunity it presumes that bame scots and other minorities can not get equal representation as judges without lowering the barr .
how disgraceful by repealing a provision that simply requires that
and replacing it with a dreadfully worded affirmative action qualification it says loud and clear that the author does not believe that we can achieve diversity without compromising standards .
and this from a party whose late msp doubted that it was racist to question if there were any black or minority billionaires .
the labour party has been exposed as racist to its core they have a cadre or members who believe that minority 's are simply too stupid to succeed in capitalism or excel in the judiciary .
well i 'm sure the hinduja brothers and justice clarence thomas would find that amusing !
but it is most worrying that a party that aspires to government here in scotland and in westminster has such strange and wrongheaded views about our meritocracy .

its either shitting on fe as a whole due to overrepresentation or corrin themselves since they were used for promotion were extremely broken on launch and is now completely irrelevant to meta .
corrin is usually targetted with a cut because they hardly do anything different compared to other fe reps .
corrin in smash is mechanically speaking way more unique than some other fe reps with both their neutral and side b having unique properties you do n't see in any other character .
i 'd put them on the same variety as ike and actually fe reps that hardly do anything different would be lucina/roy/chrom .
corrin being targetted for the cut is definitely their general hate of fe reps and corrin 's role to promote fates .

i wonder if this is a unranked ranked bug .
aka that you have a group of 5 people with varying unranked mmrs .
the game uses this initial mmr to group people for their first game and work out an initial mmr but lets a group of unranked players with widely different unranked mmr 's to queue as it only checks the ranked mmr that with no games nobody has yet .
you play the game get a ranked mmr based on your unranked mmr that one game and suddenly your team of 5 ca n't play with each other .
sounds like the kind of thing i 'd forget when building a system and not even sure what the actual fix is .
how do i get rid of the s that now appear under my regular shortcuts ?
it used to look really clean and this messes it up .
i did n't see anything in settings to remove .
yes you can fully revert and it is fully stable .
also oneplus at the moment keeps their recovery on a separate partition hence it 's good to install twrp on op devices .
there are some great root apps viperaudio for instance and system-wide ad-blocking .
the downside is that google play services carries checks for safety net so it might be a bit cat and mouse at the moment oneplus 8 devices are still passing okay .
one downside is that wildvine will change from l1 to l3 so no hd netflix and other apps which use this drm .
once i get my device i 'm not going to bother rooting this time i 'll debloat via adb .

tbh same could be applied to some girls as well .
i was chatting with this girl were planning to finnaly meet after the quarantine ends .
one day she was asking me about some quite intimate stuff and then straight up asked for nudes offering hers in return .
i was a bit uncomfortable with the idea but gave in in the end .
the next day she starts saying she do n't want to know me anymore cause she thought i was different and blocked me .
i reached out to my friend and asked if she could contact that girl and ask why .
apparently she felt like i took advantage of her even though she sent her photo willingly and told my friend to leave her alone because it 's between me and her and yet she just ignores me now not reading my messages

this is a way that your brain copes with stress .
as the world is going through a bit of chaos this is not something to be too concerned about .
this is similar to daydreaming obsessive cleaning or constantly having to engage in some form of mental stimulation to avoid thinking about stuff .
instead of putting you in the hot seat your brain takes a step back from everything so that its not in the line of fire .
and after that i went calculating them on gamepress it gave similar result .

to your point about the seal capabilities being lost my dad has raised the same point .
after 20 years in the desert there has n't been a real need to do the water stuff because you 're not gon na need it to kick a door in .
it 's a loss of institutional memory like dogfighting before vietnam combat experience among marines now iraq drew down in 2011 and afghanistan in ‘14 and flying in contested airspace we 've had unchallenged air space since ‘01/‘03 afghanistan/iraq .
what sort of budgetary wrangling would we have if we put a seal platoon with a meu ?
actually seals used to be the task force 's asset sorry recalling an old conversation i had .
task force commander would talk with the seal platoon commander about what the platoon could/could not do and how to be best employeed .
as to the meu doing meu stuff i can point out operation urgent fury grenada in ‘83 .
we had a meu two battalions of rangers at the airfield two brigades of the 82nd airborne the global qrf at the time and miscellaneous airborne attachments .
from the start of the events the killing of the grenadan pm and two ministers 19 october until the beginning of the intervention 25 october was 6 days .
granted it was a cluster when the seals tried to do recon before the landings bad weather killed 4 seals .
i 'll also concede that we hit the nation-state equivelant of the small kid on the block and we were close to the continental us which allowed the 82nd rangers and sof seals 160 soar and afsoc to be quickly deployed .
had this been further out like saudi arabia during desert shield in 1990 we probably would 've landed a meu to secure an area from which we could bring our full might like we did during desert storm .
throwing a meu at in 1990 for example iraq before the rest of the coalition got there would be the height of stupidity .
i 'm under the opinion that if a meu is trying to make an amphibious landing alone with no further support or allied units either landing at the same time or barreling in to relieve them somebody fucked up .
honestly if we get into a fight where a division is making an amphibious landing against a dug-in enemy hopefully we 'd have been able to psychologically prepare the american people and have a damn good reason for fighting .
if there were a way to make our engineering equipment smaller and lighter without sacrificing capability that 'd be awesome .
with the commandant wanting to support the navy more it 'd be awesome to be able to bring our own engineers to assist in clearing up any mess building defences and what not until the seabees get there .
my big problem with the small boats is that the pacific is littered with reefs and tarawa showed what happens when your landing craft have to drop troops at the edge of the reef .
also if i were an enemy commander and i saw a bunch of boats coming at me i 'd fire airburst vt fuzed rounds and shred the infantry and boats .
aavs can also provide fire support as the marines are landing and that would help the infantry hit a little harder .
but having the ability or training more to be like a slightly heavier ranger regiment would be cool .
what if we set up a company or two in each battalion to focus on ranger-type missions ?
keep them able to perform regular landings but focus on the cooler stuff and vice versa train the other companies to do ranger stuff but focus on regular stuff .
yeah it 's overkill but it helps to show the flag shows our allies snd partners that we care and bridges the gap between disaster and army engineers/seabees/ngo relief efforts .

i 'm also of the opinion that people overreact but there is no reason we should have to play with 11 frames of input lag for even the best connection .
add some qol changes to arenas like changing characters and allow us to choose input lag/opponents based on connection .

mate cutting yourself is a good first starter for short term release of the pain or whatever is hurting you but when you are done you probably feel the pain more after than before as you start to gaze upon the slit you made in your skin and them what happens the pain intensifies making you do it more then finally the cycle repeats .
ps if you go down your arm you will die as you are likely to cut a vein and die from blood loss
i know because i may or may not have taken a class of biology to know where pain is most intense for cuts to happen on and to know where veins are

hardest part i found levelling as a summoner was starting with an aoe pet .
you have to put him away for several quests that make enemies appears if you do n't want to be taking on too many enemies .
unlike other games your pet do n't tank or has any hp .
any aggro it gets is for you to tank .
it did n't use to be that way but the content was n't modified to reflect that .
makes levelling as an arcanist sometimes you have to go against instincts and put your class symbol away .
it gets better but the beginning really kicks you in the balls .
for the free trial it ends at level 35 and you can unlock the advanced classes at 30 .

i am not an ismaili muslim but i personally find peace in their interpretation of the hereafter .
essentially they seem to believe that everyone has a second chance or the ability to be cleansed after death .
i like this because i too know so many amazing non-muslims and would hate for them to suffer for eternity .
additionally it just seems unfair because those of us who are born muslim are at an advantage .
if i had n't been born muslim i do n't think i 'd ever consider becoming one .
i know for many people including myself faith and culture are intertwined and not many people are going to willingly let go of their culture .

i have faith in god but why am i expected to have faith in satan 's existence ?
this concept was introduced by the prophets in a time when people where much immature so as to educate them on the suject of mental realities .
the belief in a satan that whispers into the mind is a very convenient way to teach people the difference between their soul and their thought to take control of their consciousness and to objectivate the mental plane as something distinct from man 's core nature .
if you suddenly want to murder someone you may feel guilty of that impulse .
that is why the concept of devil might prove useful .
it is not i who want to commit murder .
it is satan who is inviting me to do so by submitting me a thought and i am free to dismiss this thought .
there may exist some jinns/demons as i have met one it 's quite impressive but i am not sure of their nature .

i empathize or at least try to to the bet of my ability with different peoples situation as i 'm sure there are many more people in a much worse situation than i am .
however as a country/tribe/community/whatever you want to call it it is very important to remain as objective as possible and be open to discussion about things such as potentially beginning to re-open numerous areas across the countries in order to support the economy .
unfortunately people are dying and losing jobs and everything is shitty .
nonetheless i think everyone needs to be more objective because at the end of the day we do n't want the usa and western world being the powerhouse they are/could become completely fall apart .
and most importantly our basic human rights such as freedom of speech must not be infringed .

i get that fetishes typically form when a kid discovers masturbation under unique circumstances and repeats the process regularly .
for example a shoe fetish might be caused by a kid regularly masturbating in a closet full of shoes .
or mice having sex for the first few times exclusively wearing leather jackets will form a leather jacket fetish .
but how the fuck does this kind of fetish form ?

pros i can easily focus on a task and when i stop thinking and just do i get exponentially better at whatever task i 'm doing .
i am a good comedian as i have to work harder than others to do well socially and that led to a good understanding of nuance timing and impact .
the few friends i have made do n't treat me or other players different due to this debuff .
i see injustices in the world easier than others but do n't have the power to do anything about it .
overall the debuff system is fucked and needs to be patched to make the game more enjoyable .
well now i 've addressed both in a response to another post in this thread .
sheets and towels i 've heard every 1-2 years too which feels very wasteful to me .
do it when they no longer feel as though they are functioning properly which for a towel should be a basic test does it still comfortable dry me .
do n't forget that they have a lifecycle after being your towel as well it gets demoted from 'body towel ' to 'floor drying towel ' or 'dog drying towel ' .
sneakers my dad-in-law who 's a runner said they have a milage limit but i tend to just wear them till the soles all wear out .
definitely will vary based on the quality but also the type of environment you most wear them in indoors will wear out slower than trails and also to some degree your gait some people will wear out heels more quickly .
again you should be able to just tell when it needs replacing .
guidelines are n't always a ploy to get you to shop more but using them instead of common sense will probably have that result .
it can be informative for a consumer when buying a product that you should expect this to last 2 years '' for example .
it helps them budget helps them get an expectation of quality and warranty and perhaps helps them compare products of varying prices the retailer might tell you the plastic one will last 1 year whereas the metal one will last 5 .
this can all help to inform you but as any guideline it should not make your decisions for you .
you said you never even held the child it was a stillborn .

i had a chance to chat in the official pubg discord https discordapp.com/invite/battlegrounds yesterday with a lot of console players .
i wanted to summarize the conversation and to share some of the questions and answers with anyone who is n't a member there .
if you 're not a discord member please feel free to join up and participate in future discussions discord.gg/battlegrounds .
are you guys aware of the level of anger in the console community today towards the way bots were added to the game ?
there 's been an overwhelming amount of feedback on reddit as well as on social media and in the community discord .
this is always hard as players are spread out over a lot of social networks forums reddit etc .
we 've focused most of the discussion in the official discord so far and as you see here we 're summarizing the discussion and posting to other mediums after the fact .
bots were added as part of a long-term effort to support new players across all platforms .
any other creative conspiracy theories while interesting to read are untrue .
please see the dev letter from april 24 https www.pubg.com/en-us/2020/04/24/console-dev-letter-bots
we 're currently looking at two balance related issues both of which are causing the ratio of humans to bots in off-peak hours to load more bots than we planned .
the first setting controls the way matchmaking groups players according to their skill .
during off peak hours it 's common for matches to start with a smaller complement of players .
when this happens mmr bands contract and the matchmaking service will prioritize increasing the number of players even if the skill gap grows a bit as a result .
with the addition of bots this contraction is n't happening correctly .
instead bots are filling all of the open slots .
second the fill factor controls how many players are required to launch a match .
in the last patch the fill factor attempts to fill the entire complement of 100 players even on off-peak hours .
the result of these two settings is that for many games particularly on off-peak hours the ratio of humans to bots is not working as originally designed .
why did n't you test this on the test system ?
some features in particular matchmaking are difficult to simulate on the test server .
the test server tends to interest only the most dedicated players and as a result does n't have real world player populations or the range of skilled players that the production system has .
why did n't you just add them to training mode ?
after trying a lot of different approaches in different versions of pubg we 've found that training new players using actual and regular game settings with varying degrees of bots mixed in is the best way to level up new players .
they help ensure quick queue times for unpopular modes on off-peak times .
in addition having all queues available lets new players try different styles and experiment to find the ones they prefer .
adding them to training mode does n't solve either of these problems .
bots can help simulate real-world performance problems during development and long term could also help ensure that players are always able to find a game on the test server .
will there be a way to play without bots ?
bots are aimed at new players or for skilled players looking to practice or take a break from serious play .
our upcoming ranked mode will offer players a competitive environment without any bots .
it 's just you and other players in a test of skill to rank up .
while we dislike making specific promises it is our intention to have ranked mode out in a patch later this season .
although we would still have had the balancing problems we 're seeing today it would have been ideal to wait until ranked mode was ready .
unfortunately this was n't possible for the console because testing on ranked mode was not completed .
on pc the current plan is to launch them at the same time .
barring any unexpected issues ranked mode will launch later this season .
everyone wants different things from a game at different times and we understand that adding too many bots can change the core experience from what players expect from pubg to one that is overly casual .
the actual amount of bots acceptable changes based on the experience of the player .
the majority of new players have trouble getting their first kill let alone ranking top ten or getting a chicken .
for some this level of difficulty is enjoyable but it 's very frustrating for many others .
allowing bots in the normal mode helps train players faster in a real environment with real consequences instead of the training map .
as players level up the amount of bots even in the normal mode are reduced .
although this is the current design intention it requires further balancing in order to achieve this as previously mentioned .
for players who want the traditional pvp-only experience we 'll be launching ranked mode which aims to provide new challenges for players who are already comfortable with the competitive nature of br and are looking to take their play to the next level .
we 're making changes as quickly as we can .
in the meantime please sit tight while we make updates and stay tuned for more information about ranked mode .

i just moved here from out of state at the end of last year and am still trying to figure how apartments and condos work around here cuz it 's very different from where i used to live .
ive done really well for two weeks then today..bam.. right back to anxiety and feeling horrible .
laying awake feeling sick and jumpy it really does feel like flight or fight like my body is going ... leave now you know you want to .
i was trying to figure out what triggered it and i think i know what it was but i dont know if that counts as a compulsion so then i stopped giving it so much thought .
what tends to happen does it affect your sleep ?
i could do with some coping mechanisms for these very very anxious times when the thoughts are sort of none stop .
i 'll be dropping off to sleep and then i 'll suddenly jerk awake with a 'bad thought ' i 'll try to deal with the thought by going 'ok thought hello im trying to sleep and you arent important right now ' and before i know it its 1.30am and we both have to be up with our 3 year old pretty damn early .
any advice welcome on sort of getting through the very low times would be welcome .
please let me know if you think this is too much like asking for reassurance x
this is what the novels ' trilogy would 've been like if instead of john we get michael afton as a secondary protagonist of the series as well as childhood friend and love interest for charlie .
there are going to be some major changes in the story such as there would n't be michael brooks because this is done to cause less confusion .
instead golden freddy would be michael 's brother the bv who remains unnamed but since this is n't canon to the games the bv 's death is still going to be massively different than the games themselves .
in the silver eyes michael afton would be charlie 's childhood friend and love interest who have done nearly everything together since they were kids .
mike and charlie would hang out at charlie 's home but whenever charlie asked if she could go visit his mike would state that they could n't due to how busy '' the place was .
in 1985 it was the birthday of the bv who in this au is referred to as mike 's baby brother '' and they decided to celebrate it at freddy fazbear 's .
all of a sudden a man wearing a yellow bear costume appeared as the animatronics suddenly go haywire .
the technician tried to fix it but to no avail .
very soon the animatronics stopped working altogether and mike 's brother along with the man in the yellow bear costume was gone .
weeks later mike 's father william afton was arrested and accused of child kidnapping and murder only to be let go due to lack of evidence .
however after william was let go he got into a argument with mrs. afton about the incident and decided to leave town taking elizabeth with him .
mike was forced to live with a single mother struggling financially with no time to morn the loss of both of his siblings .
both often share similar goals and interests as mike 's tragic past was what motivated him to go with charlie and be there by her side .
when first confronted that his father might be behind the murders mike would get defensive and easily agitated but when he discovered the truth he became more angry and bitter about his father being the murderer of the bv and four other children .
he later fell in love with charlie as the two grew more and more close together after they witness dave dying in a springlock suit .
after he saw charlie die he would n't let go of it and would have these nightmares of charlie calling out to him as well as william afton coming back .
mike would the the first one to figure out that the mystery woman they met is not the real charlie and played detective until he founds out the truth that the woman was actually a animatronic working for william afton .
william tries to get mike to join him saying '' son i 've always loved you .
mike refuses and in a fit of rage william nearly kills mike .
mike then meets the children william afton murdered and mike re-unites with his brother .
mike gets revived and he alongside charlie see william get burned by the amalgamation .
charlie then faces off against baby and both died .
mike attends to charlie 's funeral and morns over her death .
appearance wise mike is described as having dark brown hair blue eyes and would often wear a grey muscle short or a grey coat .
officer clay burke once told mike that he shared a striking resemblance towards his father which later on made mike hate the mere idea of having any sort of connection with william .
i am starting to work on updating about 50-60 teams on ncaa football '13 for the xbox 360 .
i wanted to post here to get an idea of how the roster/ratings line up to your view try not to be too biased please !
i can not add anyone as i am at a roster limit but can swap someone out if you feel someone is more important to the roster .
please let me know your opinion and what you think !
ps i have also thought about starting a dynasty mode that i would post weekly updates that would be story like .
long story short i live with two roommates we 'll call them a and b who share a room .
roommate a is a good friend but his name is not officially on our lease since when we moved in he was here on a student visa from another country and it was impossible to get his paperwork approved .
he 's never paid rent late or anything and that was never a concern— we chose to leave him off the lease purely for logistical reasons i needed a roommate and they needed a place to live and we did n't have anymore time to waste .
a and i want to continue living together when our lease is up in september .
we 've started having major issues with roommate b who is on our lease and have decided we for sure do n't want to live with her anymore .
she is not going to react well to this and we 've seen her turn on people in an instant .
without getting into the details we 're afraid she might be capable of doing some pretty messed up things out of vengeance so i wanted to ask is there any way she could legally fuck a and i over without also fucking herself over ?
i 'm trying to cover all my bases before we talk to her because i 'm truly worried she 'll do something petty .
that hiss/static kicks in every time sound is transmitted through which includes short bursts of noise like what i mentioned in the title .
i have tested it on and off and can notice the difference .
if you turn those features off try haptics instead of sound on keyboard that hiss will not activate during silence .
i 'm not holding my breath as i think it 's hardware related .
i had a pair of airpods that suffered through the issue .
software updates did not fix it an applecare replacement did .
i was wondering if it 's somewhat common for people to be insensitive to thc .
so i 've always always being the past 3 months smoked cbd heavy strains and recently started trying out 25 thc strains and i noticed i 'm actually getting no different high whatsoever .
i 'm only feeling a very bit of the feeling it 'd have with cbd heavy strains which i 'm presuming is just the decreased amount of cbd .
i 'm not getting anything from being giggles to creativity to a euphoric feeling just a bit less of a relaxed feeling .
i 'm at flamethrower nemesis at 1 hour and 17 minutes .
no grenade launcher and why is the lockpick in a fancy box
i find it amazing how much we cling to life and religion to help us stride in our life .
we count our lucky encounters as blessed we pretend there is a heaven .
that there is something out there for all of us that our dreams can come true .
maybe it 's like that for the lucky but it 's mere coincidence .
and even in the end when we all die it 's all going to be sad .
i just ca n't stand hearing the same bullshit over and over again and i 'm getting really tired of hearing it and believing in it .
i which my family did n't believe in it .
but there is nothing i can do at this point but sit here ... .and listen to my mom gets cursed out by my drunk dad '' listen to my brothers practically kill themselves over fucking fortnite and wondering how i 'm going to process this my own mistakes and failures and how i manage to fail to get a 100 on a test that i fucking even cheated on ... .
everything was fine when i was depressed and wanted to kill myself .
new opportunities popped up ... .i had hope again ... but the moment i become happy it all just fucking crumbles bcuz they want me to stay here and suffer ... .
estimated year of release somewhere in the early 2010 's
noble characters your character/mc a horse that follows your mc around
notable gameplay mechanics open world a horse follows your mc around
other details i remember seeing a tumblr post about some open world game that has a giant map around 2-3 times the size of earth at least that 's what the post said .
what i can remember from the post is that your character has a horse that travels alongside you plus i think you can take care of it as well .
the post 's op said that encountering people in said game was extremely rare due to the map 's size .
the quality of the grapics are n't that good as well from my memory they looked like early ps1 models polygon stuff you know ?
and that the op talked about the grapics a bit as well .
for some reason i really want to play this game .
maybe its the quarentine bordem making me want to play really obscure games .
so i 've had throttlestop for ages and it has worked fine .
but in the last few weeks i noticed it did n't start up because i have it display my temps on my taskbar .
i clicked on the app and it reverted back to the orginal settings with no undervolt .
i then downloaded xtu but that did the same thing .
my laptop has been totally reset and restored and it still does this .
simpler version basically a bored old guy who is a retired puppeteer hates his boring life and tries out teaching is reminded how god awful kids are and basically has an epiphany when he has a parent teacher conference when he gets first hand experience in how horrible can be .
so basically he gets a handful of puppets made based on local myths like bigfoot goatman mothman and a few he made up like giant wolf spider the body of a spider with the elongated neck and rotting head of a wolf and with his history of puppeteering basically scares all of the town for his own amusement .
so basically scooby doo but instead of scaring some guy away for money it is a guy scaring people for moral reasons he hates how mostly everyone is an ass so he wants to be an ass back in his own personal way .
is there a real moral to the story or point ?
no not really unless you count some on going out of their way to be karma moral but more or less a book about a guy screwing with others to learn a lesson .
i started playing this game a week ago and am really enjoying it .
i was wondering witch killers wojld be best for me a killer main only level 18 ive been using huntress and trapper cus theyre basic but any lists on youtube are over a year old .
whats the best free and buyable killer when ill eventually get to make that choice .

i 've heard there is such a thing as aluminum motor blocks but do n't know anything about them .
add on question if for some reason steel/iron became crazy short in supply what materials might be used for motor blocks ?

i have a pocophone f1 running miui 11 and s pair of original galaxy buds .
is there any way i can get some sort of battery notification or pop-up on my phone ?
i know the samsung wear app tells me the battery levels but i would like a notification or pop-up .
hugh newman and brian foerester had a huge argument with david at the last aliencon .
how he got paid big money and they did n't even get offered complimentary hotel rooms or meals .
so now we have all this division in the ufo community .
please petition the organizers of contact in the desert to get david and georgio to work out their infighting and come tongue event .
since i was running a water farm and had nearly a hundred thousand caps to spare i decided to buy as many synth relay grenades as i could and try to complete open season in nuka world with a set of unmodded synth armor with no power armor and no stealth .
i equipped the splattercannon the best that money can buy and about 300 synth relay grenades .
at first the best the synths could do was to provide a short distraction from the raiders as i slowly whittled down their numbers .
after awhile though i noticed the synths started picking up the dead raiders ' handmade rifles and started mowing down the rest of the raiders .
as long as i threw more synth grenades on top of a dead raider or synth that was using a handmade rifle i had an op synth army .
i needed to help out with the bosses but it was the second most lol open season fight i had the first was when i spent two hours pickpocketing every gun and grenade from every raider before starting the fight .
i saw it on a few videos from other players .
sometimes i 'm looking for the enemy but the items are blocking my view .
yes i can just collapse the menu but might be easier to be able to see through it .
so i was a dumbass and forgot that my cpr certification expired in april and got a warning from my manager that i couldnt work until it was renewed .
like most it 's a series of tests and scenarios on computer with an in-person skills check-off in person .
our facility has recently changed to an automated dummy .
stupid thing is connected to the computer and monitors for correct '' cycles of compression .
i could not get this right to save my life .
my boobs were in the way and kept me from locking my elbows to push deeply enough .
passing this bitch took almost an hour taking off my bra putting the dummy in the floor and a little help from the instructor .
i just saw a reddit post about a girl finding insect eggs in her dinner with people in the comments saying that it 's quite common for bugs to lay their eggs in vegetables and that they usually do n't go away with washing .
as a germaphobe who 's terrified of bugs i 'm considering never eating stuff like broccoli again .
however i love veggies and i ca n't imagine my diet without them .
i usually just rinse vegetables with water but are there any more products/methods and which of them would most reduce my chances of finding little friends in my dinner ?
edit just wanted to add that i 'm not sure whether this post fits here but it was the most suitable subreddit i could find .
when i turn on show percentage i expect to see the percentages of my mouse and not the battery of my desktop because it does n't have any .
i would like to see my mouse percentage because it also shows the battery icon of my mouse but i 'm not sure where i can report this issue .
others jump or raise their hands or do a funny pose .
but paleontoluigist just claps and raises a thumbs-up i really like his skin but just not the animation .
i recently discovered the wonderful world of dynamic maps and i wish fgu had this capability .
when i can finally have f2f sessions with my group i hope there 's a fgu mod or something for dynamic map play ...
hi all firstly hope everyone is safe and sound .
wondering if you guys can suggest some beautiful baby girls names something that has a bit of a western twist to it thank you .
one of the words in the song title is a play on the word 'metropolis ' .
i suspect it has both male and female vocals although i ca n't be sure .
and oh there 's some borderline white supremacist lyrics too .
i tried using luckypatcher so i could play fate/stay night on my phone but apparently the process changed something and now my phone is failing the safetynet test .
i 'm hoping a factory reset or something simpler would fix the problem because it 's messing with my other apps .
i like many others are exited for cyberpunk 2077 .
i want to play it on ofc because i heard that is the best way to play it .
what parts should i use in order to play the game nicely ?
i had bought this pre owned viv with the snake i have currently .
it came with a lot of problems and a sub optimal setup but im trying to make some changes .
it has a heat mat with no termostat on and i wanted to change it because not only its dangerous but the mat seemed old and not working since i touched it so often and it only got the faintest goddamn sense of warmth from it .
yesterday as you can see in the pic i bought a new mat and a termostat and tested them before id drill holes and set it up in .
im testing this one as well and it barelyyyyy emanates still the faintest heat ever to touch .
like if i kept my warm on wood for a minute or so itd be the same warmth .
then i plug it in the termostat and crank it to max 36 celsius i think same damn thing even barely barely any difference .
from what i know most people mount this under the viv/substrate or on the walls .
even if the snake sat on it straightly i doubt itll be enough for it to heat him up put it under anything and it does nothing .
its my power outlet plugged with too many things ?
i dont get it and im frustrated ... how do you use this damn thing ?
one thing i had never found in my roleplays is a typical normal guy .
i roleplay typically romantic slice of life stuff and that 's fine i love it and that 's what i am most comfortable with .
doing so you basically rp the typical couple life and like this it 's all good ... but what misses is conflict ... like my partner often has this prince charming sort of character that never does anything to hurt mc never even thinks about breaking up never over reacts is always there to listen to mc always complies ... damn ... that 's boring ...
i do n't mean there has to be the toxic/abusive relationship but maybe some times pc can be in a bad mood ... can maybe even see someone and think damn he/she 's hot ... but damn i 'm taken ... can sometimes over react over stuff can get pissed off by mc can not always be willing to listen ...
but no ... it 's either the prince charming or the abusive partner ... no in between ... nothing ... even when mc makes a mistake ... he like gets pissed off for like two minutes and then oh i forgvie you ... no ... damn ... that 's not how things work ... if mc does something like cheating i expect my partner 's character to be hurt go ballistic kick mc out and after a good while where maybe we rp their life without each other they realize they ca n't be apart ... and even then they get back together but slowly maybe pc is still resentful a bit and not always trusts mc and mc has to proove he 's worth that trust and has to fight for that trust .
do n't be afraid of pissing off mc of not always treat him right .
maybe you forget their date you have doubts on the relationship ... just let 's keep things real
hi guys i 'm really new to meditating..and i 'm not sure if i 'm asleep dreaming '' or am i not .
i 've only started meditating a couple months ago but dreaming was n't really a thing that happened until a couple of weeks ago .
i thought that it might be me falling asleep but there are many times where i ask myself if i 'm awake and i 'd know i am but trying to focus on bodily sensations or sounds around me etc and try to get out of it to shift my mind into nothingness and focus on the things i usually focus on .
but after a while i feel myself get comfortable and start having a few images in my mind again and start questioning if these things are controllable again and they are .
so now i 'm really confused as to whether this is supposed to happen ... or has anyone experienced this or am i just falling asleep lol .
because tbh i really felt like its dreaming but at the same time i felt a super out of body experience .
i 've seen a lady say that if someone gets to the part where they 'fall asleep ' or 'dream ' it means they 've transcended into something much deeper ?
idk ca n't find enough supporting evidence so help me please lol
http www.fadelah.ps i am looking for places to give my zakat this year .
i am wondering if this is a worthy place to donate to .
i was wondering how the management major at usf is like ?
also does the university provide a good job helping people with management majors find internships/jobs ?
at the end of the day everyone here is an individual .
we are similar in some ways because we have answered some questions on some test in a similar way .
we seem to perceive the world in a similar way and solve our problems in similar ways .
but each of us is formed differently by their life their decisions and their genetics .
each of us is flawed in their own specific ways and each of us bears the responsibility to try to fix that like everyone else .
i agree that in finding people similar to us we start to adapt in ways that currently make us different .
for me it definitely helped me to understand that i 'm not as alone with my inner conflicts as i thought to be and for that alone i 'm grateful .
i try to keep a healthy distance and not get too invested into any community based on personality .
the other guy does n't get the choice so neither should the murderer .
i 'm in love with that desert camo looking one on the right !
we find out on monday if they grant it .
even though there are 4 to grant cert keep in mind that if at least one of the other justices is not in favor then taking the case is risky .
honestly i think pena has the best chance to get 5 even 6 justices on the petitioners side .
the mance case is also likely because its issue is less controversial has to do with handgun sales to a non-resident this does n't interfere with laws like in ca it has to do with the federal laws although it could affect all state laws in regards to interstate purchases thus meaning ca residents can buy any gun out of state and not have to register it in ca .
as such this case has potential to be really controversial .
ccw cases are a toss-up personally i do n't see it happening and roberts may not want to deal with the controversy that will come out of establishing national ccw or at least shall-issue ccw policies in every state .
many still have not forgotten how political the court acted in 2000 and pretty much handed bush the election when gore should 've won .
aw cases are interesting because of how us v. miller talks about common-use '' and military '' firearms being protected as they can be used by the militia .
then again the miller case is also used to support gun-control and it might be construed to support an awb and it could partially overturn miller cases get partially overturned all the time .
tl dr if it 's going to be any case besides pena it 'll likely be one of the aw cases probably wilson .
i would n't hold my breath on one of the ccw cases .
edit if a ccw case gets chosen it 'll likely be the rogers case given thomas 's public comment on it .
for the 11029372047th time we ca n't just commit genocide .
in my workplace they were limiting tests per team because they realised if too many came back positive we were all going to be off self isolating .
suggests to me that there was no plan behind it just a desperate grasp and getting tests sent in that day .

your premises are totally corrects but i disagree with your conclusions .
if i know i will need a character in the future i think it 's worthy to alter my usual farming and dedicate the same amount of energy to that character .
you 're right it 's a gamble but if i get lucky i would save a day of energy that i will dedicate to use on other things in the future if i do n't it 's only another bad day .
all of you are really awesome when it comes to music !
the people who bitch about 'gatekeeping ' constantly when it comes to the music are being wilfully deaf dumb and blind .
the 80 's post punk musician i think you know who it is who i am in contact with was gobsmacked by how good the newer goth rock and deathrock bands are .
seriously he told me he was really happy to hear original 'hard ' music again .
he really likes the creeping terrors mystic priestess then comes silence etc ...
he really likes the guitar sound in those bands and told me he plans on using some of the same kind of sound in his music .
these bands are actually influencing a post-punk musician who has been around since joy division .

i have made it a rule for myself that i only tolerate my best friend 's kids .
i mean one of them was born on my birthday so i kind of have to .

we played a game of hot cold and she found the toy for me because i was drinking and could n't follow basic instructions and i think she felt sorry for me .
sars1 also does not survive for long in warm humid climates as most disease do n't either .
any idea how the current coronavirus survive in hot humid climate ?
it has to be entertaining or it would n't be a sitcom cliche but i seem to be getting more entertainment out of it then the average person .
if you 're not ok with it then do n't do it .
i mean it really depends on if you 're planning on playing competitively or not i 'd say just for main game you 'd be good as long as you 're careful w matchups and switching out .
personally ice beam is one of my fav moves so i definitely endorse it esp bc milotic is such a tank and then you also have a counter for dragons .
idk if you played diamond or pearl but cynthia is as much of a beast as she ever was lol
once again your logic is inherently ironic as you 're stereotyping a large group of people yet criticizing me for stereotyping you lol ...
nonetheless the idea of a prepper is to be prepared for shtf scenario yet you 're against gun rights ?
it has nothing to do with where you stand on the political spectrum lol .
preemptive edit maybe you are n't against gun rights but how you paint gun owners certainly suggests that you are ...

i second the comment regarding using colour correctors and concealers !
even full coverage foundations can only cover so much and you might end up making your face look mask-like in the process .
i suggest you use a full coverage concealer to add coverage on your cheeks where you need it .
concealers have more concentrated pigment and this is what they are for using a green corrector might also help counteract the redness .
this being said i would also look into a skincare regiment targeted to subduing your redness !
both not kodi but excellent tools for mass setting proper tags
so i 'm for sure overweight but i 've never been told that an elimination diet would be helpful for me .
i 'd be way more comfortable doing what you 're describing
i think that what caused the trees to look off in this case was the distortion by the lens simply rotating would n't fix it totally .
i like to use this trick https m.youtube.com/watch ? v=rlfv_60rez8 in post my sugestion would be to put the lines by the trees closest to each side but mostly experimenting and finding out what works best for each picture it can be a fun process !
ppl should still be cautious instead of going out in numbers when unnecessary if they think the virus can be easily fool proofed or suppressed then they are in for another shock soon another wave of infection is always a possible without a vaccine and cure for the coronavirus .

running is becoming a bit more enjoyable which is nice .
i hate having to bundle up in a million layers because one stretch of the run is cold and windy only to then feel completely overheated on another part of town where the wind does n't reach .
today i 'll focus on yoga and other mobility stuff and reading .
or at contrary turning childrens into adultes so that they can fight
think of the high numbers of alcoholics that would have to be hospitalized due to going cold turkey .
detox from alcohol abuse is incredibly risky without proper medical support .
we would also have seen a spike in suicides or other severe mental health outcomes as the combination of being forced to quit an addiction cold turkey and the stress of a pandemic would be catastrophic for many people 's mental health .
and of course there would likely be an increase in attempted looting or burglary of dairies and other places that sell cigarettes and alcohol as people get more and more desperate to get them .

keep watching this story thread develops quite a bit over time .
also keep in mind that it was the 90s and thus there were certain attitudes that were considered 'the norm ' back then that would not fly in 2020 and the fact that writers rooms back then were even more straight white cis male dominated than they are now so everything was coming through that particular lens .

nerf the speed of titans first then we can talk about accelerator for them .

it makes really sense now when i thought of bpd .
of course i do n't wan na play doctor to self-diagnose so i ought to seek professional help soon as quarantine ends .
you 'll find woman who will be willing to date you and be part of this scenario .
my ex girlfriend was married to a female but they had an open marriage .
when l met her they were n't doing the greatest and were in separate rooms still married on their 12th yr. l was skeptical but was n't looking to be super tied down and my ex gf was and is an amazing human ... l was literally drawn to her and did n't care .
she has had several gf 's in their marriage all fully aware she 's married but has open marriage with separate girlfriends outside of marriage never overlapping into their relationship .
i 've seen many woman on dating sites with your life situation and looking for exactly what are describing .
i actually almost went on date with one we talked few months but men scare me !
so a hubby in pic is a pass for me ... but you will find girls interested .
my advice be 💯upfront no hiding the fact that you 're married etc .
if you know you 'll never leave your hubby be totally upfront about that too .
also decide do you want girl who wants to meet you ... hook-up once and then never met again ?
you want same girl to hookup with occasionally but premises is ... for lack of better words your fuck buddies. no attachments .
or if you meet right person you want serious relationship ?
if you use dating profiles to meet girl you probably know this but you 'd be considered married but polyamorous .
you still love being with your husband in a physical way ?
i 'd just encourage you to communicate everything and know what your looking for .
i showed my rash to a phd ... he said take two kakfa and call me in the morning ... ..
doctors can save lives most phds are just p**iled h**igher and d**eeper ... ...
what i 've found about phds is that it is more dedication the intelligence ... .i stuck with two masters because 6 years more of school was insane ... .
but i see australian news reporters over there reporting from the streets ... and people are out and shops are open ... ?
as if i thought the minecraft version of the coffin dance could n't get any better ... it did
your sound bar will also not really be use by the sound card .
optical signal are just send to the device that will decode it .
the sound processing will still be done by the sound bar .
the only thing that one of this sound card could add to your optical signal will be the different sound profil '' eventually creative alchemy for old games that could be apply before the signal is convert to dolby digital or dts connect by then send to your sound bar .
sound card quality is important for analog connection in that case sound processing is done by the card and the quality of the sound card is important if you also have a good speaker/headphone analogic behind .
when you make a wild claim that no one has even heard of before it helps to present some evidence to get everyone on the same page .
1 khz idea goes along like this since is a pretty recognizable tone as it 's the bleep dub over swear words in media and other kinds of beeps you hear with appliances etc are usually 1 khz .
you 'll know if a tone is exactly 1 khz or not .
i ca n't say i 've noticed they 're all the same and i 'm sure we have a couple of similar devices at home that beep at different pitches .

do you have in writing anywhere that the position you were joining is paid 18.50 your former pay and others pay does not count ?
if not you are just going to have to be patient with them .
if you do you could file a wage claim with the state .
while its unlikely that you could keep it while ur in halls if you stay in private accommodation their should n't be much problem with keeping it .
most people only stay in halls for a year anyway so if you could leave them with a friend for a while ur in halls

there are people who say that ignoring the villager will work but i honestly think its random .
the best way is to wait for a camper when you have max villagers and replace chow with a desired camper if chow is still stubborn to move out by then !
i believe after 6 days since the last camper visits theres a 20 percent chance that another sister will come although i 'm not sure
iirc toast has elaborated on this later on stream and said that it was n't about him not understanding the contract but wanting to sign with offlinetv instead of tsm after signing .
the weirdest part is that when they 're raving so someone asks for a link they 'll dm it but not post it publicly .
i 'm nosy so i always want to know what else they 're saying when they dm links lol ... of course it 's their twitter not mine so it 's not actually any of my business but still .

it 's not that i love the old map but i hate the new map .
it 's kinda just empty to me and most of the stuff there especislly the returning locations just feel like they were lazily ripped and retextured .
either that or they 're the same to another location .
the only 3 locations that do n't follow this principle is sweaty steamy and dirty .
every other location just feels like we 've seen it before .
and then we have the fact they removed 75 of every item in the game .
fuck the map just give us the old loot pool back .

i had tried the graphic novel a few years back and dnf'ed it .
i was almost halfway done when the bingo opened .
i am in the middle of a re-read of the entire series .
funny how much i do n't remember about this particular book because with the exception of port of shadows i had read every book in the series at least twice .
i saw the ebook on sale and had seen where it was a hea book of the month .
i just played the bingo shuffle a few days ago because i originally had the ten thousand doors of january speculatively in this spot .
but i read some comments from the book club read there and i thought i would not enjoy it .
so snowspelled got moved from romance my placeholder for made me laugh swordheart is now sitting as my speculative choice for romance .
iron dawn got this via a coupon for catalyst games belong to the newsletter .
i was acutally dreading the school square sick of magic school and this was a pleasant surprise .
had a perfect bingo square for it so i went through .
i think this is a book that i would be expected to love but it fell flat .
as much as i love books about books otherwise the x-files with librarians '' niche market does n't do anything for me .
i dnf'ed the invisible library for last year 's bingo .
i saw this on my shelf and realized i had n't read all the stories yet .
i usually try to use vance as my re-read but cook was already in play .
even if you have n't read any vance you will probably find a modern author you like in here who will tell you how influential vance was to them .
maybe we can bring on a new vance fan or 2 .
the tea master and the detective this will end up as a substitute square depending on which square i have left over at the end .
like x-files meets librarians spaceship ais in their second careers do n't do much for me either ie imperial radch
last year 's huge hit was the wandering inn which i am reading volume 3 for the necromancy square .
imo the best graphic work i 've read since sandman although i have not kept up with most graphics works in the past decade or so .
thraxas was the huge hit for me in my first bingo award winning .
i now try to read the next book along in the series for a bingo square even though i read them more than 1 a year .
this series is very reminiscent of asprin 's myth adventures series .
because the framework is mystery i find thraxas more enjoyable .
because i love mystery with my fantasy except x-files and librarians .
already shifted as part of the bingo shuffle game now covering the more difficult politics '' square in lieu of the easier made you laugh '' square .
because of the quarantine i will in all likelihood be finishing earlier than my usual finishing time of about 6 months .
if i finish in say around 4 months i plan to start a retro fantasy bingo '' where i will complete the card one year back from the first card i officially completed in my case 2016 .
i plan to make a separate thread on r/fantasy if and when that occurs in case others may want to join me .
i think a lot of people started with the 2017 card so hopefully i can get a small group up .
there have been a number of rules changes since to make the bingo dramatically easier .
my current plan is to do the card with the rules set of the time but that may change .
i am not sure of any that give the full .
i do n't think that would be a very common occurrence due to the process in finding locates .
borrow rates can be looked up but can vary throughout the day and vary a little by source .
every time i have checked etrade 's rate it has been pretty close to 50 of the rate i have seen .
the amount you get paid is your cut of daily borrow rate eod equity value 365 each day .
since both the rate and the value changes daily it is a gamble as a strategy .
it might be i could n't play as corvo but imo they butchered the shadow powers .
states like montana north dakota and idaho especially do n't have any requirements .
it will most likely require speaking to an authorized importer and getting import stamps .

1200 dollars and the effect of the economic crisis has not really hit yet for the majority of americans .
we went from 4 percent unemployment to roughly 24 .
but its more complicated than that a lot of people are now on unemployment which shrinks the impact of that number the 1200 honest softened the blow for many people .
not that i think this will last the great depression happened 6 months after black monday .

it 's not a perfect comparison by any stretch but if a female ceo gets paid more than a male entry level employee that does n't just mean there is not wage discrimination .
not all jobs are created equal just like all games are n't created equal .
and thus while average pay per game is a useful measurement it ignores the fact that playing a world cup final is n't the same as playing a friendly so it ca n't just be an end all be all of an argument .
ultimately i 'm not trying to argue the merits here .
i have no law background and thus am not qualified to argue the merits .
but if a judge who has been on the bench for nearly 20 years has never had a case in this area upheld i would put it as very likely that this one is n't either .

prior to becoming pregnant i was a fairly fit person .
i worked out 5-6 days a week 2 hours a day .
when i found out i was pregnant i stopped taking my adhd medication which influenced my energy level and on top of that i was extremely nauseous for the first 6 months of pregnancy .
i started drinking sugary drinks and i watched my weight go up .
my self esteem is virtually nonexistent and i feel devastated that i 'm not this fit sexy person anymore .
i 'm scared that i have to continue to gain weight but i 'm trying to do things to make sure i only gain the necessary amount .
now that i 'm not as nauseous i 'm eating healthier when i can .
i also found out late in my pregnancy 28 weeks that i was anemic so needless to say i was doing little physical activity .
now that i 'm starting to feel a little more energetic i try to do low impact exercise like walking or prenatal yoga .
you 're definitely not alone in how you feel .

i have no idea who they could get now we 've still
not heard anything about metallica but they 're rumoured every year .
maybe is ratm are n't playing we 'll get a new headliner !
to be honest i would n't rule out mcr just yet either .
if they did agree to do download 2021 they would have signed the contract at at time when their headline shows were still going ahead on the original dates in 2020 and it would have therefore been their only uk date of the year .
i think download would be silly to cancel their appearance just because of their headline shows as they 're a guaranteed massive pull anyway .
apparently on one of the emails about the rescheduled shows it said you have to apply for a refund by some time in may which suggests they want to get the available tickets back on sale soon which could of been influenced by someone they 're doing a show with in 2021 wanting the shows to be sold out again by the time they announce them aka download .
considering the shows will definitely be sold out either way i can see them still doing both because a fair chunk of their fans will go to both the headline shows and download because they 're so dedicated and in some people 's cases have waited a long time to see them so the usual headline show distracting from sales for the festival does n't apply here imo .

if i had to choose one of the games it would either be majora 's mask or breath of the wild .
i had gotten into loz long before having any of the games .
so one time i begged my parents to get me majora 's mask for the 3ds .
it was the first thing i had become interested in an entire series of video games rather than just one in the series .
and breath of the wild was a master piece .
and i almost cried when watching a few of the cutscenes .
i did n't think it was fair for her to die .
the games also help me talk to my friend 's dad a lot more since he is also a good fan of the games .

i am wanting to buy around 80k mt on ps4 for 2k20 but i can buy 100k if needed .
i am willing to pay via any app website available as long as it is a fair price
seller must go first dm me if u have any inquiries
anyone know how to host a server that supports ps4 xbox and windows 10 ?
have a group of friends i want to set a server up for but having trouble finding something we can all play together .
i bought an x100s last summer secondhand on ebay and i 'm now having the recurring issue mentioned above .
taking the battery and memory card out while it 's switched off is a temporary fix but i 'm guessing there 's no way of actually getting it fixed ?
i see a few threads about stuck curtains and i guess the advice would be similar .
not at the present time anyway the way things are with coronavirus .
hi first of all i 'd like to apologize as english is not my first language .
so i have the opinion that multiplayer competitive games are the most toxic .
no matter which game such as moba fps fighting or anything .
here is my reasoning why i feel these genres are the most 'dangerous ' .
the community of competitive multiplayer games is the most toxic no matter which game you 're playing at .
you 'll encounter trashtalks insults or any interaction that will get you personally attacked by words .
unless you mute the chat or voice interaction those toxicity are inevitable and will reach to you soon .
for the first few games you may enjoy it as it 's fun and challenging .
but as the name suggests you 'll eventually get competitive and gon na tryhard for the game .
these games are n't that fun when you 're losing .
to avoid feeling bad because of losing you 'll try to train and improving on these games .
yeah there are a lot of hobbies or skills that you can choose to improve but instead you 're trying to improve at your game of choice .
you 'll spend a routine to train for the games and watching guides on the internet .
eventually you 'll get matched with the people with similar skills and mentality as yours .
the most toxic of this point is there will be a lot of kids or adult gamer that will try so hard for the game to reach the pro level .
they wanted to make 'gaming for living ' reality .
you 'll be facing a neverending treadmill of competitive gaming .
this is similar to the previous point but i 'd like to discuss this separately .
by winning the games sometimes you 'll feel that you 're achieving something .
as your rank goes up you feel you 're going to top .
but it 's just a video game it does n't bring much to your real life .
they earn a lot of money by winning and streaming !
just think how many percent of gamer that actually reach t the pro level ?
even the pro still has to struggle as they get not that much payment if they 're not winning .
also your game of choice does n't always have an abundance of tournaments right ?
yeah it looks lucrative by seeing those big-name earning a lot of from donation and sponsor .
if you think you 're able to achieve that sure go on .
but just remember even those streamer have their hard path for becoming as it is now and it 's also competitive to become a streamer .
you can choose any skills or hobbies that are also lucrative apart from gaming right ?
i may be wrong and if you have any other opinion i 'd be happy to hear it from you .
i was wondering if it would be possible to play a sound when no one is talking in a discord channel ?
i know how to make the bot join a channel so yea .
could you suggest me some festival art-house or any other non-mainstream movies with dynamic plot ?
i like watching something unusual but i really ca n't stand scenes with characters sitting in silence for 10 minutes straight or something like that .
i know it 's deep but my add wants some colors emotions and development .
its been over a decade since playing so ive been excited to come back to the game .
it felt good installing the game with the cd 's .
when logging into battle.net https battle.net east ive tried to find people to act 1 with and every single game consisted of bots and no legitimate players .
they were all high level bots just leveling people up .
every single game i joined had 0 real players and i joined every single one of them .
after trying to find at least 1 other player to no avail i decided to just rush towards hell .
obviously no one was at nightmare but even then i think ive only found two other legitimate players after hours of searching in hell difficulty .
does no one play on battle.net https battle.net anymore ?
everyone who posts here seems to only be single player only .
finding real people seems to be all about having luck .
he has been impersonated and the impostor 's account name is u/welcometothebrox .
i have not a single record about some frigid asking for truncheon or being locked up .
me girls vicky and the guys are doing difference by the pivotal admonitions and the bitches will remember for a while .
maybe we should pretend they are starting the riot ?
thompson needs the kick to the guts and guess who will do that ?
her face is the first on my list others are there without me knowing the names .
blood and the purple skin would just make them pretty .
michelle is never behind and never ahead she keeps the tempo with me and the closer we are to the chief the more often she opens her mouth .
vicky was proud of me and i never heard her anything about you displeasing her .
she got permission to come with two more people .
the council guys are partying for the whole week ? ''
saw the bitches now they will be just among the top dogs ''
vicky cheers when she sees me and squints her eyes happily when michelle´s freckles also shine in front of her .
oh your intuition spared me a few seconds . ''
telltale ... count how much energy and speed is required to be prepared for 7 pm . ''
two and a quarter of an hour to do something about my face ?
we are like some two cinderellas with a living mom .
till our way doesn´t divide we are trotting as one from the security command into barracks c-a .
i don´t have a large window at my place bitches have larger ones just like everything there are five of them in one place ... oh i don´t need that when i can switch on the light and look into the mirror .
michelle won´t do anything about her face while mine is a god´s gift not a canvas for a palette of makeup .
indecisiveness kicks in when i see my figure in a black cocktail dress .
i like to be sugar dressed in the thorns not in the glaze .
blahhh this is a dream job but i am not an addict anymore .
there is more than one way to be intimidating .
d. and m. come to meet me in the instructors ' lounge .
there might be some fun in work before the play .
i browse for the map and the short line to that place near the central library object a-b .
my arms and legs feel heady when they can breathe the evening air .
the sun is giving us the last friday rays ... bloody hell i´m going back in the night !
i won´t get much sleep and tomorrow is promising nothing more than some tedious surveillances .
the ball better be full of glimmering and real-life kens .
somebody talks in the lounge i hear the voices of two ladies but neither of them is vicky´s one of them talks in a much farther distance .
i can do maybe two steps and the long table is trying to break me in the waist .
the damned thing is being used now as an island with shipwreck survivors .
hot blonde guy with a goatee drinks the tea and some greyhound-faced warbling gal in white is putting biscuits between his teeth waiting to the bite and finally pushing the second half whole .
she is either completely androcentered or madly in love ...
i now recognize him he is the one who teaches the little scraps almost everything including the men-worship .
her big pupils observe the muscles as if they had arranged a private blowjob lesson .
replace her with me anytime bro for my cocksucking is an a .
i am not noticed by them but by another female nerdy face the long needle going through the bun of black hair .
i can´t tell if she is bitch or free .
vicky dressed in a robe is standing and watching the other motherly person .
that is clara ... rosenbaum i think who pacifies the scraps .
i´ll talk to her and you can be present .
i ... no bringing anyone here is forbidden and one of them ...
we must make a normal kid out of her .
she mutes the cell phone and disposes it under some handkerchiefs in her purse .
sorry vicky this has to be one of your lieutenants . ''
too lazy to correct her that i know we do a short handshake .
did i came here cause of that thing you were phoning about ? ''
no that will be taken care of by me and two co-lectors . ''
you have come at my request '' says the angryfuck georgianna .
at the holy submissions area i was visited by the two sons of the dodge family .
their desire is something they are ashamed to talk about but considering who they are and who i am ... we made a very lucrative deal .
one that must include wardens and some other lectors .
i made a little performance script with a role for each attendant of this meeting.
show it to her michelle is busy with her ugliness shaming issues '' says vicky .
georgianna gives me a paper page of the printed text with some underlined sections .
tonight we are going against every chapter of the announcer ... justified by friendship and armed with a love of buck ! ''
my section of the paper isn´t exactly individualized so when michelle in the blue dress comes to the lounge i am holding it in front of her nose .
vicky and the blond guy weatherby are at the forefront of our gala flock .
clara and georgianna on their tail me with michelle are showing back to the ever-obliging natural sciences lector whom weatherby called once lucy '' i think .
thus accepting our indicated order of importance we are getting to know the golden heart of the b complex .
we can´t sit in the lobby heirs and heiresses have the full privilege and an innumerable amount .
it is impossible to bow to each of them separately so we just tend to look to the ground and back off to the company of other lectors and section chiefs .
i look up admirably to the guys do some funny faces behind the ladies and despite no one is watching me i am changing body postures .
one of them has to be the right for flaunting myself to make people wish i left my dress right in the hall .
we don´t hear the sound of lock this far we notice the change by rippling of heads .
we resume our formation and we are not using merely the sight to set our direction .
all of us hear the regular thudding as if something truly big wanted to talk with the dude who lives on the other side of the ground .
the sound effects go on each time louder than previously .
as we are closing in the sixth thud roars and the unusual echo comes the wordless voice from the hollow sky .
sweet jesus it pervades me how i will survive where the loudspeakers are ?
the tones are now quieter and take the turns .
drumming calls our strength the echo invites us to venture anywhere we are needed .
i am now in the ballroom the queue is dissolving .
in the dark the higher i look the more i see .
i don´t mean the movements and the reflections in the balconies .
above the door is white canvas with tower symbols the least visible even in the blue half-light .
the opposite wall is covered in the black layer made prominent by the golden emblem of a horse and the grown man giving longbows to three small boys .
brotherhood´s official seal is maybe more tasteful than the flag in the middle .
the fraternal prefectures of atlantic are giving the wrong kind of homage to its core predecessor .
an entire half of the space is given to the field of numerous tailed stars and in the upper left corner is a simple monad as a distant heritage from the technocracy movement .
the rest are three stripes white red and green the last one being the only reminder of mexicans as one of the founding nations .
every staff member goes to the walls we frame the hall .
the heirs receiving our strong applause are less and less misty as the lights show their glory now in proper spacing .
men have the uniforms women wear robes but on them are metals of accepted daughters .
everybody must prove themselves everybody is in a unit .
he stands in the wide lodge presiding over the tower canvas .
gentlemen among you might long for sleep after various episodes of passion which makes me and the other servants of the reeducation program extremely appreciative of their presence .
the first weekend ahead of us means the new way of inmates ' preparation .
after all the day doesn´t pass here without a unique kind of enlightenment .
the heiresses will be more involved walking by side and talking to our rapunzels during the model of social life .
tonight however dance and meet new people in the realm of free citizens . ''
there we are at the point when people say and the fun begins . ''
i see the people pulling the other person they could very well be paper butterflies on sticks .
i wouldn´t do it even with the hottest of our lectors .
i´m rather searching for the tallest guys eyes sliding from the shoulders down taking notes and creating a puzzle of my hypothetical ideal man .
michelle is looking for a dance she´s parading to the heirs no less .
if they 'll get a hard-on by looking at a sibling or at freckled gargoyle ?
perhaps she will give a hard-on to that single guy who turns down every woman and is impatient to cross the hall .
has a glasses and dull asymmetrical face but cool brown hair and does every step like on a parade .
i with michelle go a little closer not so much because of principal himself we follow the lead of vicky another not-dancer .
stay on the floor and talk to them '' she says .
victoria i would gladly get them to know but honchos of head honcho are only summoning not descending ... '' he points out the brotherhood canvas .
cao and neumann want to discuss something about the security possibly other issues ... ''
and you will have to tell me security things after everything will be agreed upon . ''
come to think about it they asked me about it if i have no consultants to add and i can see you as such .
fellows will like a couple of them coming voluntarily . ''
oh if it comes to triple dating i choose cao .
the way up has a lot of stairs owing to the fact they are low so the rise towards the nest of power is not strenuous .
the clicking of heels against the music of the ball is lost at the top .
on the right there stands a miniature waterfall that is in truth not so small and the water is murmuring .
neumann pays attention to that very thing stiff on his chair .
cao is the one who stands up as we come close by .
fellow mayson we thought you don´t have the suites .
and that in case you would come with someone that it would be only one person . ''
fellow mayson you are so far good in presentation .
i hope you like the tower as much as our guests do . ''
i believe in my mission to bring inmates to their senses and decent families to satisfaction . ''
although i always disliked the name the princess tower '' .
doesn´t make it sound us like fairy-tale villains ? ''
it´s not just romantic it makes inmates feel loved .
i also heard it was put there to make them remember they are vassals of the state daughters of the princeps himself .
besides fellow cao maybe not you but i was frequently entertained myself by the idea i´m a bad guy . ''
slant eyes are suggesting that cao´s brain is startled .
fellow mayson dear madame i have heard that the special inmate of the tower was put to the soft torture yesterday ... ''
this will make that simpleton remember to behave for weeks .
if she will do something at least of that proportion it will be worse and ... ''
you are not doing anything worse to her on a physical level that´s a type of deed my prognostic section forbids in any case !
only a total cretin would think you can reeducate an ideologue of her magnitude .
she can have nightmares for the rest of her life that´s the point but she´ll survive graduate the henpecked husband will apply for her and they will freeze in nunavut .
but the public should be assured she is alive and no woman should want to live like her ''
i want them to change if partially in some cases .
we have stern people who know their limits . ''
just as we aren´t in a position to ditch religious leaders we can´t be silent to pamphlets of those pseudo-fellow naggers .
they like to talk about the danger of rape and the towers are the bait of such tragedy happening .
to minimalize the threat is in everybody´s interest . ''
ok fellow we´ll consider it but don´t overvalue them . ''
clara is ordering spanish flies i am in short of bromine .
please distinguish after the delivery '' jokes vicky again .
brotherhood has revived the circulation of the product and the profit . ''
the auctions at the end of the school year will crown the big push of the industry .
trade with people is too much tempting to be completely nonexistent and trade with women comes from the instinct of man . ''
it is not about the moment when somebody pays for them .
if we want to treat them as prisoners or slaves that´s purely our choice .
we feel a sense of life from giving the commands they from obeying . ''
girl taking commands from a woman has it best ...
i hope this is making the world wealthier and more natural .
also it gives us so much of wherewithal i can finally see the shooting of a first-rate perry rhodan movie ! ''
perry rhodan is some character from german kiddie books who flew to the moon and now fights the whole universe .
fellow neumann i knew you are a beta ... . ''
he is a follower of the inspirational imagination '' says mayson .
we will revisit our former lives the next week . ''
you´ll speak with foreign politicians and i´m directing the mine of bribes . ''
there´s a different game to be played '' admonishes neumann principal´s suggestion .
no later than at the end of september the towers principals will be invited to the e-conference with prefects and one or two naggers representatives .
ladies do you have something to do for like an hour and a half ? ''
the single mean student girl has caused us abrupt distress . ''
i don´t know which rascal dared to make problems and how she made cao and neumann discuss it .
in her dress and rapid running she is flickering like a flame the parquet is burning purple .
picking up clara and also weatherby we are on the move and our ignited plum is checking the dancing couples .
she gives me a shove and i focus on the square-jawed lean guy .
i talk to the lady pinned against his waist first .
i am warden and your partner must come with us .
with his brother he went into our locker room and waited to that indecent part we had no more modesty than yet unaccepted women we are guarding ! ''
he must also be the one little girls accused of he offers them cigarettes for services '' says clara .
no wonder they can´t tell writers apart miserable wretches '' comments weatherby drily .
edward dodge come with us for the disciplinary procedure '' shrieks georgianna .
he is with his girlfriends on the left side mistress ! ''
christian did utah dating ... princeps agrees so let the old norms be damned .
he is in the middle of them makes a pirouette with one takes the hand of the other .
christian is claiming innocence until i take him by the ear and michelle does the same with edward .
we ca n't afford the slow stumbling most guests do n't know about the number .
it would be even more awkward if somebody saw us between the buildings .
once we get the delinquents '' on the fresh air we pull them only by collars of their shirts for the shortest route to the dungeons .
georgianna chooses the part full of autopsy tables and coffins .
she commands heirs to lay down in their underwear and considering her tone nobody would ever want the order to be repeated .
edward and christian show us how they look in boxers and i am accepting the uniforms .
michelle is puffing like i don´t remember her from the ball .
georgianna borrows the coat from the natural sciences teacher .
tonight i´m going to be ms. judge before that however i must become ms .
she lifts the arm and moves the fingers individually .
she accompanies the clutching pressuring and stretching with a frightening face and the lying man is avoiding her gaze .
he starts to exhaling deeply when the front of his boxers is supported by something else than georgianna´s hand .
edward has arrived at the same state just by watching it .
georgianna thrusts the hand into the pant leg and diminishes the effect by some strangling of his balls ...
these are healthy young men so they can be tried . ''
she returns the lab coat and makes the duo stand .
under the new instructions the boys are brought to the external holy submission installation .
georgianna pushes something on the ground and the fire in the middle of the stone circle lights up .
i see some ... set pieces of the african village of about twelve huts .
edward and christian kneel before the georgianna who is watching the fire .
weatherby tries to raise a hand but recedes to vicky´s amusement .
the three fake witnesses say what they presented during the fake arrest .
their sentence is the justice of the amazons ! ''
she goes to the biggest hut and returns with medium-sized ropes .
she bounds one brother´s hands and she uses the opposite end to immobilize the other pair of legs .
lovingly instructs edward to do a few circles around a fireplace pulling the christian through the grass .
common whimpering makes them annoying and refreshing at the same time .
georgianna stops them and puts them and puts the second rope to use .
she ties up edward´s cock and does a loop around christian´s neck on the other side .
the brothers can take a rest but it ends soon and round two forces christian to hold his head over the ground unless he plans edward to taste agony .
the delinquents are waiting for the third part of the sentence completely bound each on one side of the fireplace .
georgianna me and michelle change in the hut taking straw skirts leather tops spears and spotting the mouths with bloody red color .
we are jumping around the fire and the guys like kangaroos on acid clashing the spears and pushing the blunt ends right up captured anuses always only for the moment .
as when the pointy ends pierce tiny random skin-covered place .
the treated dodge brothers are sleeping in the morgue '' next to the clothes and their dance partners must have gone through dozens if not tens of handsome suitors .
tonight´s privy party would shit themselves laughing if the masochism cost christian either of his girlfriends .
upon the return i saw the myriad of guests some of them possibly could have come later .
the savage girl opened me to the party spirit and i dig what the people are sharing .
higher brotherhood people are heavy with problems they can´t solve now so they talk about the future not about the present .
i must be wary when kicking thompson and you are reading space crap .
now about the poor girl on the infirmary ... ''
i recently started playing again about a week or two ago and enjoying de .
elo is around 1050 and that 's obviously very noob .
seeing rankings i 'm about 12k in the world ?
i was wondering how many active players there are in total ?
if i 'm pretty much exactly halfway or if there 's many more ?
is it hard for you to be honest and tell us that you are n't interested ?
is it hard for you to say that you do n't want to go on another date ?
is it hard for you to say that you do n't want to chat ?
yes the truth hurts but what hurts even more is catching you in a lie
i was talking to this girl for a few days and we went on our first date pre-quarantine by the way .
we went out for coffee and i thought we had a pretty good time .
she was laughing we were flirting and things were going great .
i asked her if she wanted to go on a second date at the movies and she agreed to it but on the day of she had to cancel it since she was busy .
i went anyways with a friend on the same day to the theater and i saw her with another person fun fact same incident happened with the last girl i went on a date with
i do n't understand if it 's a problem with me but this happens almost every time i 'm with a female .
i do n't understand why you girls ca n't simply say no or if you are n't interested .
recently i 've been having trouble using the increased draw distance in runelite .
it wo n't show anything past 25 no matter how high i set it to .
i 've tried reinstalling runelite and turning the gpu plug in on/off but no luck .
the groan filled my mind just as much as it spilled from my lips voice deep and husky with sheer unadulterated lust .
i never even imagined ... . '' i start watching my swollen pink head splitting the smooth brighter pink of your soft inner lips followed by the length of my hard vein-laced shaft disappearing inside of you feeling your velvety walls caressing every inch of my sex as i bore into you and cross the proverbial rubicon .
feeling the head bottom out against the wall of your womb i see an inch or two of tan flesh still lined up at your entrance next to the bright pink lace of your thong so casually pulled aside and flanked by the soft pale orbs of your heart-shaped ass beneath the bunched fabric of your skirt around your waist .
i lick my lips tasting your sweet nectar still lingering on my lips and in the short black hair of my beard as i start to slowly pull back out watching your tight inner lips gripping my shaft as it slides out inch by inch now coated in a thin layer of your arousal and nothing else .
i start to slowly slide in and out of your tight sex with smooth even strokes the soft curve of my oversized head brushing against that cluster of nerves against the front wall of your perfect little pussy with each stroke my heavy balls swinging like a pendulum against your puffy lips .
picking up the pace slowly but steadily i grip your soft hips with my large muscular hands fingers digging into the pliant flesh to pull you back against me .
as i slowly build from that first tentative stroke passing through making love to you and on towards fucking you the overwhelming lust clouding my mind urges me to bring those hands down against your perfect orbs one and then the other leaving angry red hand prints on each cheek .
hearing your soft moans and little grunts and groans as your face is pressed to the pillow i can feel my own lust building along with yours as you shift to reach back with one slender arm between your thighs elegant fingers slipping between the apex of your lips to tease the firm nub of your clit adding that pleasure to the feel of my girth filling your cunt .
i want to see your face '' i say voice still husky but evening out and less gravelly than it had been with my first moan as i entered you after burying my face between your smooth thighs .
as my manhood draws out of your pussy i can see the white froth of cream forming a ring around the circumference of my shaft at the precise point where i bottomed out inside of you .
my cock still sticking out lewdly in front of me i divert my attention from that to take in the sight of you .
your long legs unfold as you move to your back the pattern of the lace cover of the comforter visible on your pale knees in bright relief .
your perky bust stands proud on your chest as you lay back still not quite at their full size and falling to the sides but large enough that we both know that they will someday you thinking of that day with concern me with little more than a smirk and a quick nibble on a responsive nipple with your shorts and bra tossed aside and laying somewhere on the floor in our hurried lust .
the filth of our act is in stark contrast to our surroundings .
the stares from the boy band posters on the wall .
your childhood bedroom and the site of so many of our trials and tribulations and now our triumph .
taking the base of my shaft in my hand i place the head against your waiting entrance once more staring into your eyes and seeing them filled with lust in a way that i 'm sure mirrors my own .
slowly leaning forward i have to adjust to accommodate my shorts and boxers bunch around my muscular thighs not even removed in the mad rush to be inside of you .
i sink into you and slowly lower my weight onto you lips meeting yours and allowing the taste of your sex on my lips to mix with the taste of mine on yours .
slipping my knees up beneath your thighs and putting my weight on my forearms to either side of your head adjusting as you yelp from the pressure on your hair i start to plumb your depths with an unbidden thought of all of the fights and struggles that accompanied your path to maturity and eventually this very moment .
i can feel the lace digging into my knees and forearms but my mind is much too focused on the building pressure in my balls as i continue to kiss you passionately and roll my hips burying myself to the hilt in you with each thrust .
the room slowly fills with the occasional small moan or whispered sweet nothing and the increasingly-frequent filthy urging along with the lewd sounds of my thick cock sliding between your soaking lips and my balls slapping against the small bit of your bubble butt exposed by your thighs gripping my midsection .
knowing what 's to come i start to think about options .
rather presumptuous of me at this point in our relationship .
about to reach a conclusion my thoughts are abruptly and irreversibly brought to a screeching halt .
i hear breaking the kiss as my head flips upwards to stare at the open doorway and yours flops back over the edge of the bed to see the same image upside down .
my wife your mother standing in the doorway face painted with shock and horror as she catches her husband and daughter in this most primal taboo state .
i freeze just as you do with the shock that we were not in point of fact home alone for the night as she had suggested .
in the residual contractions of your subsiding orgasm i 'm pulled over that edge unaware of the fact as it happens in the sheer panic of being caught in such a compromising position .
my cock twitches and jumps my balls contracting rhythmically as they empty themselves inside of you in that final act to seal our tryst .
obviously i 'm looking for something centered around the relationship between a father and daughter with plenty of detail and very much preferring quality over quantity/frequency in replies reddit pm only please at least for the roleplay itself chat ok for setting the stage .
interested in stepping back and exploring how we got here ?
sounds great though i 'd hope if you want to try something more cliché that you can provide a twist to keep it interesting or write well enough for it not to matter .
want to continue on from our rude interruption and explore the twists and turns our new situation takes us through from my wife/your mom being chill and understanding about it all maybe even revealing her own interest in such activities to trying to pretend it never happened but constantly finding ourselves tempted by one another all the way through running away and starting a new life together where nobody knows our relationship ?
want to play the cucked wife struggling with a mix of arousal and humiliation ?
feel free to send me a message whenever you see this and we can chat about characters and how we want to play things out and run from there .
as long as it 's up i 'm open to play .
all other prompts in my post history are also open .
i do n't think there is a cure or a magic pill that can completely eliminate depression .
once your mind wanders in the negative stream of consciousness which springs from depression or as i like to call it the dark zone '' then there 's just going to be cynicism negativity and suffering .
but while i ca n't eliminate the dark zone i have learnt that i can try and go away from there by shifting my focus on something else or a task .
so next time i think that tom dick and harry are better than me in any way possible i should sit at the piano and practice that piece i was working on or maybe i should start that workout routine that i had in mind or study for my next exam .
why has the world decided to choose me as the biggest loser ?
instead i should be thinking what fingerings can i use in this passage ?
or how many reps and sets of this exercise should i do ?
or what does the author mean in this chapter ?
the bottom line is i should be completely immersed in a productive activity to such a degree that my mind has lost focus on all the negative shit it was worried about .
yeah it will come up again sooner or later but at least i have reduced my suffering this way .
come to think of it am i depressed while i sleep ?
no because my mind is focused on ... who knows what .
it is known that physical activity helps with depression .
so does n't it make sense to make it a big part of your routine ?
you 'll get all the health benefits and self-esteem boost .
it 's like taking more medication '' but without particular contraindications .
now i 'm feeling obliged to say that i 'm speaking from personal experience and am no professional .
been getting into railgun since i 've been always curious and did n't think there would be any filler .
the beach episode kinda set off an alarm in my head and some googling showed there 's actually a lot of filler .
i want to upgrade my athlon x4 860k to a better mb and cpu and maybe even ram .

hey everyone i was listening to a great podcast called the eastern border by a latvian former ussr citizen and in an episode about the red army he mentions an exercise the ussr conducted in 1953 where zukhov was present .
the goal was to determine the effects of a tactical nuclear weapon on a mock-up of the west german/east french country side and villages .
the podcaster mentioned that penal divisions were sent in to do the mock assault and many of them died horrible cancer deaths and as they had sworn not to tell about the exercise the doctors were bamboozled by the uptick in deaths .
i played a lot i mean a lot of fow when it hit the scene .

1 guard your steps as you go to the house of god and draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools for they do not know they are doing evil .
2 do not be hasty in word or impulsive in thought to bring up a matter in the presence of god .
for god is in heaven and you are on the earth therefore let your words be few .
3 for the dream comes through much effort and the voice of a fool through many words .
4 when you make a vow to god do not be late in paying it for he takes no delight in fools .
5 it is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay .
6 do not let your speech cause you to sin and do not say in the presence of the messenger of god that it was a mistake .
why should god be angry on account of your voice and destroy the work of your hands ?
7 for in many dreams and in many words there is emptiness .
it is interesting that in the new king james version verse1begins walk prudently when you go to the house of god. the king james version reads keep your foot when you go to the house of god. prudently indicates with care. keep your foot can just as easily be translated as watch your step which is also a warning to be careful .
following the previous chapter where god is not even hinted at chapter 5 in which solomon is observing people going to the house of god implies a warning to be careful not to leave god entirely out of life .
more positively we can also take it as an admonishment to make sure that we strive to keep him actively involved in our lives because at baptism we gave him a solemn promise always to submit to him in every facet of life .
before committing our lives to him in baptism we are strongly counseled that we must count the cost of him being first in our lives .
were the attitudes and conduct of those whom solomon observed such that they were robbing god of the reverence honor and respect that he deserves ?
were their acts of worship perfunctory insincere and hypocritical ?
our so-far cursory reading of the context has provided us with a clue solomon does not direct the admonishment of chapter 5 toward those who have no relationship with god at all but he focuses it on those who do have a relationship with him .
they have specifically gone to the house of god ostensibly to continue the relationship .
however additional information reveals that though they have good intentions their minds wander easily .
they find it hard to focus to give him their full attention and to follow through in obedience .
this is another gentle reminder to the called of god that in our lives everything matters .
going to the house of god is most definitely not a time to lose focus and let down in our discipline .
to help drive this thought home notice the next phrase in verse 1 .
it speaks of those who draw near to god but who give the sacrifice of fools. draw near clearly describes people who are doing something about their relationship with god which shows a good intention .
the word sacrifice indicates something given in the behalf of another as christ sacrificed his life in our behalf .
christ 's sacrifice was not foolish in the least .
these sacrifices are not merely foolish however because solomon immediately elevates them to a far more serious level as evil .
english synonyms for the underlying hebrew word translated as evil are bad as a modifier and wickedness as a noun .
thus what these people—who have a relationship with god and who are making a sacrifice in attending temple services—are doing is far more dangerous than they appear to understand .
strong 's concordance adds that the hebrew word behind evil combines both the deed and its consequences indicating injury both to the perpetrator and to those around him .
solomon is saying that whatever these people are doing will do nobody any good .
it is especially grievous in its effects to those who have a relationship with god because their actions either begin or sustain a destructive course .
i 'm in my second year taking accounting bba in langara and i wanted to transfer to sfu bba or ubc but i do n't think i can with current gpa .
i know some of my friends are planning to transfer to sfu and ubc but their program is in science .
i was wondering if langara is a good school to graduate from .
will employer consider applicants who came from better school/known university ?
will there more better opportunities if i graduate from sfu or bcit or will it be the same ?

i am posting in this thread to provide some context .
i do n't understand how they pass such complicated relief measures and then expect ordinary people to understand them .
then i do n't understand how a software like turbotax ca n't perform the simple task of carryforward-ing nols to a following year .
strangely enough i have not found a thread on the subject of individual nol loss carrybacks carryforwards carryovers .
for a list of reasons most definitely their fault i 'm only now being able to file 2016 to 2019 returns .
i had 3000 5000 of nols every now and then in those years for all sorts of things like itemized deductions in 2016 home office expenses and an odd section 179 deduction here and there .
i just realized after 13 years of using turbotax home business that this software does not automatically transfer over or import any previous year carryover/carryforward nols to the next following subsequent year yes it always gave me the the option to file the irs section 172 b 3 election to forego the carryback period for net operating loss '' nol and that simply kept me under the assumption that nols were transferring over to the following years ' returns without me having to do anything .
so basically all those years i happily kept filing form 172 b 3 and foregoing any prior year refunds meanwhile also losing out to any future tax relief benefits .
although this only really affected me one tax season after years of recession year losses when i finally made enough to claim those nols in 2013 i see now that it was a large enough loss that i do n't want it to occur again as i do now again have nols for 2016 2017 and 2018 which i would now like to realize from the income i finally made in 2019 .
in addition i might be able to benefit from the newly passed covid-19 related tax provisions in the cares act that allow individuals to utilize their nol towards the 5 years preceding the tax year in which the nol gathers .
can someone advise if there is another tax software that automatically carries over nols from one year to the next ?
since i am only now filing all four years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 all had refunds due anyway i have discovered luckily in time so need some advice as to how best to go about taking advantage of the newly passed provisions whereby my losses from 2016 2017 and 2018 could be accounted for and finally relieved .
should i just file them as i would have filed prior to the cares act and then file 1040x amendments and form 1045 respectively ?
i paid a lot in taxes in 2013 2014 and 2015 .
in fact even after paying i still had a 2000 refund in 2015 the last year i filed which i let them keep and apply towards 2016 !
from what i understand i can apply the nol accumulated in 2016 and carried forward to 2017 to 2012 or 2013 ?
2016 nol was carried over to 2017 where again there was nol so 2016 gets added to 2017 and then can be applied to 5 years preceding january 1 2017 to 2012 tax year and beyond ?
2018 tax year nol can be applied to 2013 and beyond ?
if there is any nol left over after all that can it be applied to the income in 2019 to offset income and reduce taxes ?
would it be better to carryback and file 1045 and 1040xs or easier and more hassle-free to simply carryforward instead to present year and allocate all accumulated nols in 2019 ?
like another person asked are we allowed to allocate nols amongst different eligible years at our discretion to gain maximum benefit or do we allocate the most to the earliest year and the remainder to the next and so on and so forth until depleted right ?

it 's coming up to our ninth anniversary in a couple of weeks though with the lockdown measures it 's looking like we wo n't be able to do a customary date-night at a restaurant and a few bars in town .
around this time last year we got engaged so also have to have that year marker in lockdown too !
and though i do n't think anything will really top that experience i want to show them how loved they are supported and just generally have a good time together .
however i 'm struggling for good ideas obviously going out is n't in the picture save for government sponsored exercise and cash is tight due to job-losses etc .
we have been through a lot in the last few year but come out stronger every time through communication and actually working together on our relationship .
i guess what i 'm trying to say is how do i show someone that i value and love them in a gesture outside constantly saying i love you i love you i love you '' every day and every night again .
we 're both quite introverted if that helps with any ideas !
thank you for anyone reading this and stay home and stay safe !

recently my 4k video projects have started to take much longer to export .
i 'm running a 2017 imac with 4.2 ghz intel core i7 40gb ram and radeon pro 580 8 gb .
i 'm using premiere pro 2018 and trying to export a 4 minute 4k video for example at 50mbps totalling 1.5 gb is estimated to take 2-3 hours..
the footage i 'm using are 4k mp4 an mov files from my sony panasonic .
when i check my activity monitor during the export ram usage is around 20 gb and cpu for premiere is around 300 .
i feel like ever since i installed windows on another partition premiere exports on my mac partition has slowed down dramatically .
solution for some reason my video rendering playback '' got changed to software only rather than gpu acceleration ...
i changed it back to gpu acceleration and it took the 1-2 hour export time to under 10 minutes .

when looking through a list of mel 's unreleased songs that she wrote for cry baby i realized that a whole lot of them have studio-quality recordings and there are enough to fill a whole album .
this gave me the idea to make a full 13 track album of songs that are b-sides for cry baby including the bonus tracks in the deluxe version .
i thought that if mel ever released this album it could be called cry baby 's extra clutter like the ep but longer than the ep .
what do you guys think about this idea ? ?
i feel like this would make mel 's fans really happy and that she should do this ! !
especially with the recent popularity of play date it would be a cool idea to give cry baby songs some more attention .

i 'm looking for anything you do n't really want or any extra diys that are cool .
japanese items are a plus currently making a zen garden .
we 've had 3 weeks of free unequip in a row .
i 've been able to throw gear around and build to try a lot more units than usual including putting together a niche wyvern team which i would n't be able to do as easily without it .
another thing is that we are increasingly forced to put gear on fodder units just to play the game due to artifacts and gear sharing inventory space .
due to very low amount of charms we often do n't know if gear will be usable and if you want to swap it from a fodder to a strong unit after finally gathering enough charms it 's another 100k to swap the gear to the main unit .
if you have more pieces this price can quickly accumulate .
usually you have to wait 3-4 weeks for free unequip it would be nice to do these kind of transfers in the weekend .
i think the main argument against free equip is guild wars which would be severely limited by doing this only on the weekends .
if we have it every week we can also just do it saturday and sunday and not at all during the guild war week .
48 hours every week would still be good to throw around gears .

my friend and i were talking about the same thing i would love for one were you could have a slot to place an item locally upgrade building for more slots and maybe a market influence bar for a general income from the market but you could sell an item for a capped amount of orns gold .
and maybe in the market as well be able to send followers on market missions for material like firestone 's wood souls ect .

in ontario for a few years we had to commute an hour both ways in order to afford our mortgage which is still much much less than most other houses in the area .

hey i 'm in my first year of an arts degree do the papers get harder each year as you move through a degree ?
some of them i 'm doing now say in their blurb about how they 're purpose is to prepare you to be able to study successfully at the higher levels .

i 'm passing my papers so far but was just interested how it works .

first let 's conclude that debt is bad and eliminating it is your goal .
i also think living at home as a short-term foundation to attack your finances is another great step .
i 'll give you the short version of what i would do if i were in your shoes
it 's a new month in may perfect timing .
budget at the beginning of the month every dollar has an assignment emergency fund car free money phone etc .
i 'd save 1000 in the first month as a starter emergency fund .
i would attack your cc debt as fast as possible and then attack the student loan debt .
i know it 's deferred but it 's not going anywhere and needs to be gone .
what does your life look like with no credit card debt and that student loan off your shoulders ?
get intense about getting this debt out of your life .
i know the remote job is temporary but if i were you i 'd be looking to take action on how i get my income to 3k 4k per month by picking up extra jobs and doing some major hustle to get this crap out of my life forever and tackle your education and life goals with financial clarity .
do n't worry about 0 apr credit scores or piling up a savings account .
treat this debt as a mess that needs to be cleaned up and that it takes 100 focus .
if you chase three things at one time you will still be broke in may 2021 and wondering what happened this past year .

to be honest i feel like stormfiend is much easier to deal with than rat ogre .
easier to control thanks to the aggression trigger on his back slower easier to dodge because the attacks are heavily telegraphed and tends to stay at a distance allowing ranged characters to just pepper him to death instead of bobbing and weaving in melee .

the thing is it 's got the grand scope of a 9th level spell but the situations where it would be mechanically useful over other 9th level spells are almost nonexistent .

first of all thank you for submitting your bug report .
sadly enough it is placed in the wrong location so instead we would love for you to add them in the comments section of the bugs megathread that corresponds to the most recent patch version which can be found here http bitly.com/dntlsbugs .
by doing so it allows the dev team to collect all incoming bug reports more effectively and efficiently .
they probably had a plan to align a big marketing and availability push with the release of alyx .
i also wanted to add this ... my parents were born in italy but emigrated here in the 60 's ... so they bought the italian tv package from comcast ... .italy is under lockdown and im guessing most of europe is as well ... .my parents watch their nightly news and nobody whatsoever is talking like this guy or any of those protesters ... none at all ... they all understand whats going on
i cant speak for all of europe but it appears from what i hear from my parents that nobody in europe is thinking their freedoms have been taken etc ... ..only in the us do we have these fucking fucktards ... .
i also want to say what happened in michigan with those guys armed and going to the government building is fucked up ... .we all know damn well if those guys were all black guys people would be freaking the fuck out they all would have been arrested a couple would be dead trump would be trashing them on twitter and fox news would be going ballistic ... if anyone ever says white privilege doesnt exist show them that

i guess i do n't see what the problem is here ?
you guys are n't together because you do n't want to be with her .
sure a doctor will probably tell the guy to lose weight and will do anything possible not to prescribe him trt which is a problem many doctors have in my opinion but honestly with those levels he should be on trt .
it would likely help him tremendously and may even help him lose the weight .
it 's easy to always blame low t on someone 's lifestyle but the opposite may be true as well .
i think even if the guy was super strict and able to lose the fat he would most likely still produce like 400 ng/dl at most .
and yeah if he still lives with his mom that 's a problem but who knows why that is ?
it 's very much possible the guy acts/feels like a manchild because of his low testosterone .
i do n't like it when people try to compensate for a horrible lifestyle by taking some drugs but i also do n't like it when people criticize someone for having medical issues and blame their lifestyle .
if this guy wants results he will probably have to work his ass off while being on trt in my opinion .
this nigga did that when i was in the 90 's ... he did n't invent nothing

i personally just do n't really like co-op for anything other than leveling up characters because the bots are n't interesting enough to play against so i 'd rather earn points more slowly while playing a gamemode i enjoy .

the point i tried to make that you evaded as if your life depended on it is that your exact same idea would have been accepted just fine if you did n't denigrate your opponent for literally no reason .
i did so because even if you 're just another rando on the internet i also used to be a smug asshole in my youth and believed being correct came before everything else .

to be fair english has been one of the most inclusive languages in history .
from anglo-saxon integrating norman french to the british commonwealth to now .
words in english/germanic languages also tend to be a lot more flexible .
romance languages tend to have their words be a lot more specific .
it makes languages like french and latin great for law because of its ease of being very specific .
english speakers use french and latin for legal terms because they were historically viewed as prestige languages .
latin was the language of the educated in europe .
of course they used latin it would n't have been any other way .
further french is so prevalent because for the norman invasion and the history of france and england not because the french language itself is somehow superior .
or that the english were more willing to accept norman than others .
one group conquered another and their language eventually mixed with the local language .
for example you can see the same phenomenon in arabic and persian .
plus it was the lingua franca for diplomacy for a period of time .
that 's why we have so many french words for diplomatic terms e.g .
we could just as easily say interim ambassador '' or acting ambassador '' or second in charge . ''
despite what you say there 's nothing inherently better about using one language over the other .
english speakers are perfectly capable of using more germanic or english words for legal terms .
the use of latin in english is more to do with a fetish for the roman empire and devotion to the church than the inherent superiority of romance languages .
you can observe throughout history how prestige languages and dialects are favored over others .
for example currently english is the language of science .
the vast majority of scientific research is published in english .
that does n't mean that english is a better language to describe science .
so as a consequence of english dominance around the world english terminology is creeping into other languages .
but that does n't ' mean that these languages lack the ability to perfectly describe something .
like how it was to use latin or french .
the last dlc is the only one left out .

very recently an absolute legend by the name of u/cheese-water gave me the best advice i 've ever heard .
you can still be generous as long as you keep two things in mind
do n't let anyone else know you were generous to someone .
they will then probably either want some of whatever you gave or will criticise you for virtue signaling '' or something like that .
you set hard-and-fast limits stick to them and make them explicit this is all i have to give you .
if you want more you 'll have to find it somewhere else . ''
this keeps people from seeing you as an infinite resource .
everything i said is just shit you disagree with bro .
and with all your evidence bull shit you must think we are in a court of law .
if you guys are ever stuck let me know !
i will gladly help you out with monument puzzles how to raid properly and anything else !
it 's actually only there because of one of the legendary bounty missions .
you might save a few by making sure hospitals are less stressed but i 'd wager your reduction in fatalities is going to be less than 5 over just letting this thing blow through .
so you 've saved a maybe a couple thousand people over 80 per country and increased the poverty rate increasing the stress on millions of people .
what sucks is that there 's no way to get reliable data for comparison .
one side will see the brave defenders of society protecting us from the heartless capitalist science deniers .

the bc3 's even though they are messed up in many ways they are still counted as a remaster of the bc3 .
88 's and free throws are not remasters of the white cement .
time is a factor branding and quality and the fact at what they added clear outsole or even the white cement jt3 with the 3m swoosh nike on the in foot side .
just like how the 2015-2018 remastered 1s dont look shit like the 85 ' pairs they are still a remaster of og colorways .
the 2020 mold is way better and when they do a bc3 or white cement then i 'm copping .
actually i 'm gon na cop the red joints and repaint them to be bc3 's .
i remember i initially skipped on the 2018 bc3s because i did n't like how they rolled it out but i realized i wanted them and copped down the line .
an og colorway will trump a lot of issues i have with a shoe .

leftist choose to complain and tell everyone how much better corbyn would have been when in fact we know that 's all bullshit .

it reminds me of every ufo story someone sees a strange light in the sky it gets reported .
someone else responds to that saying they heard a sound in vaguely the same time frame and location .
another saw eye glare in the woods at night .

that thing only let go because it managed to implant it 's egg .
i do have confidence issues and also tend to be introverted as well .

visit a ubuntu kernel developer under the pretense of borrowing a cup of sugar .
when he or she opens the door put your foot between the door and the frame and begin talking about all the bugs you have found over the years that the developers seem uninterested in fixing for you .
if the developer threatens to call the police ignore him until he begins dialing a phone number .
pet his dog and repeat your wish to borrow a cup of sugar .
continue describing all the things that the developers have done wrong over the years until the police arrive and handcuff you .

i say at least you do n't live in one of the countries both parties support that dehumanize imprison or straight up murder you for having the wrong parents.
you 're one of the most dishonest people i 've seen on this site and that 's saying something .
you do n't give a single flying fuck that democrats willingly enable murderous dictatorships empower despotic billionaires or stoke the fires of hatred against their own citizens .
as long as you get to look down your privileged fucking nose at someone you deem beneath contempt you are all too happy overlook the hypocrisy of the team you support .

most kh fans will be over the age of 18 especially considering the series is just over the age of 18 .
it is clear that this situation is caused by a lack of knowledge in product design and management .
for some bizarre reason captioning is consistently a blind spot in many of these software companies .
they have no idea of the goal the process or what a good user experience would look like .
so in one of these companies when users are asking for a captioning feature the product manager does n't know what that means and the designers are busy with much higher priorities .
the feature is n't started yet but marketing dept is adamant that captioning must be in the next release .
with deadlines looming a junior software engineer who has never captioned anything in their life is given the task .
no time for detailed design spec just see what you can come up with in a couple of weeks along these broad lines .

by the way i 'm talking about bpy.un on the tsx .
he had stopped chanting when he had jumped over the railing of the first longship but the words get repeating in his head .
when he swung his poleaxe into the first lightly armored brute who came at him digging through into his side he had smiled .
let me take more my son was worth more .
the battle raged on in the deck of the ship a larger northern ship pulled up on the other side .
he wasted no time in seeing which one he needed more blood .
he forgot who he was he fought with a viciousness he never knew he had he slew a man begging for mercy he caught another by the foot as he tried to clamber over the stern railing to dive into the sea .
deeeaath '' he turned and screamed to the rest of the ship seeing rodrick ryswell staring at him from down below astonishment in his eyes .
the last thing he remembered was some men he did n't recognize pulling him off the captain who he had been slamming his axe into repetitively .
something about the ship sinking there was n't time .
when he got back onto the northern ship he looked around and realised the battle had been won .
he shook his head wiped some blood from around his eyes with a coil of rope and sat down .
he was n't dead yet there was still time for more blood .
more blood for hardle and a good death to join him .
m we have a longass time until the next battle here is a place for pre/post/in battle lore and rp because we have nothing better to do till the rolls
what headcanon or your own original idea do you think luffy will get ?
incorporating advanced armament haki into a gear 4 form like he did with advanced observation haki/snakeman ?
tigerman '' with extra focus on armor piercing strength to beat kaido .
personally i think this one is pretty likely but not the final power up for him
advanced observation and armament haki implies the possibility of advanced conquerors haki this could perhaps be somekind of endgame power really emphasizing his unbrekable will .
how will this take form according to your ideas ?
will he just make the environment be able to stretch and bounce .
that would put him ahead even future sight users .
i was thinking about a gear auto or something where he just goes on instinct but that might be too similar to dbs 's ultra instinct .
anyways just throwing some pretty common ideas out there which ones do you think is the most likelyto happen/do you want to see the most or what ideas do you have yourself ?
ive been sitting in space slightly under the world height limit for almost 2 hours now with a battle potion and water candle and still no sign of a martian probe .
i have another player in my world also sitting on a platform in space with a water candle and they dont seem to be having any luck either .

i am prepping for enrollment in an mpp program and would like to specialize in american welfare policy analysis and related program evaluation .
however as my background is not in policy or politics i would like to gain a deeper understanding of the history of the welfare state and related theory pertaining to the united states .
there are many sources but i 'm not sure where to start .
i 'm not saying brigade them on their social media but it 's where the concerns should be going .
here on reddit 3 or 4 infinity ward devs sometimes browse but the activision social media is where they will feel pressured to answer to the negative press and bad brand image from bad game design .
i made a post before did n't really click with anyone .
i 'm looking for some friends to hopefully have for a long term lol .
i play video games pc and xbox so it 's a plus if you do that and want to play .
i thought the title was something along the lines of one thousand and one nights but the only thing that comes up when i searched that is a yaoi which definitely is n't it .
the manga was n't for kids i remember there was nudity and the only other page i remember is that there was a royal couple who were brother and sister talking in bed .
i remember seeing this in a book store about 10 years or so ago so it had an english print at the very least .
hey there i have recently picked up anime and i love it.my fave so far is seven deadly sins nanatsu no taizai .
but i saw there is a season 3 wrath of the gods that is n't dubbed yet but it is out in japan so when does the dub get released in europe ?
my girlfriend said it 's very simple your towel is grey and my towel is mink

i absolutely love my razer viper mini but the scroll wheel is absolutely horrible in my opinion .

i had a 2 month break and now when i log in i can only do some color challenge ?

so i 've had an idea floating around for a little while involving ariana grande and a non-celebrity person starting to date i 'm happy to involve a different celebrity in her place as well as use a celebrity reference for my own character 's looks .
basically i was thinking of something where will has worked at or owned a small cafe for a few years and almost since the day that he opened ariana has been coming every week day in the morning for a coffee before she goes to the studio or whatever photoshoot she has that day .
her and will have always chatted a little bit here and there but never have their conversations lasted too much longer than it took for ari 's coffee to arrive in her hand .
there 's been a fair amount of flirtatious comments shared but again nothing that 's gone further than the publicity of an open coffee shop would allow .
i was thinking either one day ariana arrives and hands over her 'keep cup ' for will to brew her coffee into and as will pours the coffee he spots her phone number written on the side of it for him .
or alternatively one morning ariana comes in for her coffee and will writes his own phone number on her takeaway cup in hopes of getting a call back .
i 've got a few other prompts in mind that i 'm happy to brainstorm and build off of i 'm also open to changing or adding to this starter in basically any way i 'm also happy to take this idea in pretty much any direction be it a vanilla romance or something much more kink oriented .
my only real limits are scat gore death and vore .
most kinks i am willing to include to some extent if it 's something i 'm not all that experienced with i 'll just prefer to discuss its inclusion a decent bit prior .
i would prefer to play this out in discord but i am fine with playing through reddit pms .
i decided to replay the bfme games and some mods including edain mod .
i kinda forgot how the installations are supposed to go but ended up getting the 3 games .
then i duped my rotwk folder installed edain in one of the folders and tried to launch it .
it works but for some reason the game displays a lot of missing '' text mostly for ... well all non-vanilla stuff .
i looked it up and it appears to be a language issue but both my edain mod and my game were installed in english .
i 'm playing in 2.01 and did n't patched the game in 2.02 .
ps i was surprised to see this subreddit and seeing the community as a whole so active i do n't recall the same activity 3 years ago .
being the cover art killer we have decided that the trapper deserves some buffs
survivors can now jump over a bear trap if it is placed under a window
we have reduced the required time to set traps from 3 to 10 seconds
if a survivor steps into a trap he/she can wiggle free instantly
if the trapper steps into a trap he can not escape unless he is helped by survivors .
being part of the original three and often considered to be one of the worst killers we have decided that the wraith could use some buffs as well .
the wraith 's bell will break after he uncloaks the first time .
after he hooks a survivor he can no longer attack for the rest of the match .
the nurse the nurse has been making the game less enjoyable for the survivors so we have implemented the following changes
after the nurse uses her first chain blink she will be fatigued for the rest of the game .
the nurse 's bonesaw gives survivors the endurance status effect for the rest of the match and gives them a speed boost
the shape 's terror radius has been increased to 32m at all ranks
if the hag teleports to a trap that was triggered by a survivor she will be attacked by her phantasm instantly killing her and ending the match
if a survivor is near the doctor after he/she has been hit by his shock therapy attack the survivor will pass the electricity over to the doctor frying his brain and ending the match
the huntress many survivors have been complaining about the huntress ' unfair ability to harm survivors from long distances so we are implementing the following changes to her kit
the huntress can no longer get extra hatches from locker
if the huntress misses a survivor that hatchet can then be picked up by any survivor and used to instantly kill the huntress
if the cannibal enters the basement he will be teleported on one of the basement hooks and be sacrificed to the entity .
being one of the top killers for a long time we have decided the nightmare could use some nerfs to make the game more enjoyable for survivors
if the nightmare teleports to a generator that generator will blow killing the nightmare and ending the match
if the nightmare tries lunging at a survivor he will immediately disconnect and be permanently banned from the game .
the pig we have removed the pig from the game
when the clown throws a bottle he will throw out his back making him go into a corner and start crying for the rest of the game .
if the legion tries vaulting a window or a pallet while feral frenzy is active they will break their legs and be unable to move for the rest of the game
if a survivor is hit by feral frenzy they will be granted the endurance status effect for the rest of the game
the plague 's vile purge now can affect her too if she infects a pallet or a generator and she walks by them she will be infected with the disease and die after a 3 minute countdown .
hitting survivors with the plague 's censer now blesses them rendering them unable to be harmed or infected
if a survivor reveals the ghostface he will commit suicide and all survivors will escape
if the demogorgon uses a portal he will be stuck in the upside down for the rest of the match
if the oni absorbs blood he will get aids instantly beggining a 2 minute countdown after which he will die
after the oni activates blood fury he will pass out from anger
if the deathslinger attempts to reload his gun the harpoon will get stuck removing his ability to shoot .
we have removed the deathslinger 's ability to hit survivors
we have also removed the following perks from the game
barbecue chilli pop goes the weasel a nurse 's calling discordance corrupt intervention sloppy butcher thrilling tremors surveillance infectious fright monitor and abuse save the best for last hex no one escapes death i 'm all ears hex haunted grounds whispers hex devour hope enduring brutal strength bamboozle make your choice surge blood warden rancor spirit fury thanatophobia franklin 's demise hex ruin bitter murmur play with your food dark devotion hex retribution stridor hex thrill of the hunt iron grasp agitation nemesis hex huntress ' lullaby tinkerer remember me dying light lightborn overcharge shadowborn knock out dead man 's switch distressing spies from the shadows mad grit fire up iron maiden deerstalker hex the third seal gearhead blood echo insidious unnerving presence predator beast of prey unrelenting
if eac detects that a killer is using a vpn he/she will be hardwareid banned
we hope that these changes will make the game more fun for survivors because who gives a flying fuck if killers have fun amirite ?
you are the last person that connects me to the lifestyle .
what i texted you what i said as cruel as hurtful as it was and sounded .
you broke my family apart and brought us even closer together .
you were the reason i want to change the world for the better .
you 're the reason i 'm still alive today .
you 've changed hairs longer you 're a little plumper .
but just as beautiful as the day i met you .
it 's not your physical beauty or your body or anything like that .
i fell in love with it was your soul .
only a fraction of who i truly used to be .
when someone tells me i ca n't do something or to give up .
i 'll go all in just to succeed and prove to those who said it could n't be done .
i started honestly with the intention of learning more about your lifestyle .
i know you say you do n't blame me .
i ca n't just keep putting the blame on you .
did you know i successfully tapered down for a month .
i keep researching and changes as i learn more .
each failure i relished because i learned what worked and what did n't .
it might sound terrible to say it this way but ... each person i met .
i tried to help from the bottom of my heart .
but in reality i also had an ulterior motive .
i tried to gather from their experiences to see if i could learn anything to help you .
i initially thought i failed you because i had no experience helping battle addictions .
i wanted to show you what the drugs did to me .
but nothing could 've prepared me for what was about to happen .
then everything happened that both sent us to a dark place .
i saw what i was doing the pain trouble everything i was putting you through .
i did n't know you 'd fall deeper into the hole .
i may have started to try and understand you better .
it 's like the last 2 years i 've been hiding away from the burden of everything going on in my life .
when we met i was showing you the real me .
but only half i was already broken and beaten down when i met you .
i hope one day i can show you the real me .
so i do n't know how long it 'll take .
hopefully it 's nothing serious but this whole time i 've been so focused of other things i have n't been taking care of myself .
but you 've maybe see me at about 30 of the real me .
i can see the degradation of my mind and brain .
but i 'm going to strive to get back to the best version of me i can be .
i 'll never be the person you met in the beginning .
it i hope you can accept the real me .
after i vented my frustrations and anger out to you .
i stated to realize how silly i 've been this entire time .
i 've got one last thing to get off my chest and i should be good .
after all as much as there is bad in this world there is also good .
i hope the next time we meet if we ever do again .
i hope that we can laugh smile and i can tell you this in person .
if not i hope this letter will be enough .
i hope we can both be real with each other for once .
okie i have a couple questions about how the amiibo cards work .
i 'm new to animal crossing and just got new horizons and i 'm very puzzled as to how they work lol .
if i buy it from ebay used does that mean that because its used i ca n't move the villager to my town ?
can i trust ones sold on ebay or is scamming a common thing ?
if so any reccomendations on trustworthy aces to buy them ?
what are these tokens '' that apparently work the same as the cards ?
i am really thankful to have been able to visit ge east in february before the world became so incredibly different .
the day went smoothly and was a great time much in part to all the advice i gleaned from here before the trip .
i thought i 'd share some photos of the day for anyone wanting a bit of batuu .
note there are photos that may be considered spoilers for rotr/savii 's

my boyfriend has a habit of slapping me hard on the ass when he 's upset with me .
i did n't think this was a big deal until last night .
we were having a petty argument about what to watch on netflix .
he started to get upset because there was a comedy he really wanted to watch and i was agitated because he got to pick the last two movies .
i told him exactly that and he told me to take the tone out of my voice .
i said i did n't have a tone but i would speak however i saw fit .
he proceeded to raise his hand at me as if he were going to strike me .
he hits me hard on the ass and says that 's what i thought .
i 've never been scared of him before though he 's the only place i feel safe .
i do n't think he would ever hit me but i did n't think my last two boyfriends would either .
he 's the love of my life and i do n't want to lose him if i 'm just blowing things out of proportion and projecting trauma from previous relationships onto him .
tl dr so raises hand at me big red flag ?
true north is opening up our clan to anyone who would like to join .
we are looking for respectful and active members who can play with us and dominate opponents in clan wars .
do you have those cards like the goblin hut that needs to be off your hands and you 're looking to donate them away ?
are you looking to laugh as you zapped your opponent 's king tower accidentally during the beginning of the match ?
join us and i guarantee that you will not be disappointed .
i have no idea what happened but all of a sudden i ca n't play this game anymore .
i ca n't win a faceoff to save my life everyone on every team i face is faster than everyone on my team i ca n't clear my zone to save my life passing is an absolute mess my players miss the net more times than they get a shot on goal everything just feels slow and i have no idea why .
i used to regularly place platinum/diamond earlier in the year and now everything has absolutely fallen apart .
i 've dropped two divisions in the past two days and have absolutely no idea what 's changed .
usually i 'm good on faceoffs but i barely get into the double digits of wins now and regularly get outshot by double digits every single game i play now when that used to never happen .
i 'll be the first to say that i 'm not the best player out there but this has happened routinely for the past 30 games so it seems unlikely that i 've run into 30 opponents in a row that are that much flat out better than me .
i 'm not saying i should be on a win streak or anything but it just seems like out of nowhere everythings gone to shit .
i 'm desperate for any kind of help at this point .
so im watching the ufo show on netflix hangar 1 .
and in episode 2 they are talking about the theories about denver airport and how many speculate about there being an underground base there .
they are talking about the construction and how it went millions over budget and took way longer than estimated .
so anyone who is from boston or mass or new england over the age of 25-30 might remember a little project called the big dig .
how the put our major highway system that snaked thru the buildings of boston like 20 feet in the air .
well they put all that underground and built another tunnel to the airport .
so this project took so long and cost so much money that it was a joke in mass for years .
but now im wondering if all that digging and all that concrete couldve led to an underground base in the city .
between the money spent and all the trucks dirt concrete everwhere u could connect city the statehouse right to the tunnels or to the water .
hell they probably already had tunnels from the state house towards the boston commons .
just wanted to share some thoughts and see if anyone had any opinion on them .
or maybe u have other info or thoughts on underground bases and the theory of them being connected coast to coast with highspeed pneumatic trains or some shit .
seriously i feel like with the amount of coverage on his antics his lying which has been documented many times his narcissism the countless things hes said about people to people and just the general vibe he gives off he would be in some hot water rn .
i mean the guy was impeached accused of rape and so many other things .
and no thats not my way of pushing a political agenda he has done these things .
what do you guys think the auditioning process will look like after the pandemic ?
do you think in person auditions will even exist ?
or do you think theyll exist and just be much more rare maybe limited to callbacks or something
it sucks because being in the room is always better for us and now i feel it will become rare
looking to build my first pc main use would be playing games cod borderlands etc on higher end graphics .
i have the budget to buy the geforce rtx 2080 super but am wondering if that is overkill .
the rtx 2070 is 200 less would that give a similar performance ?
so i 've been looking for my first cheap droid for over a week now .
there are so danged many of them to compare .
every time you pick one oh what about this one here '' lol .
i feel like the redmi note 8 pro is the best i can do for 250 cad '' 178ish usd currently but i am probably wrong .
i did want to try an get oled but i guess i will have to live with ips heh .
so i guess this is me asking if there is anything way better out there for under 200 usd before i buy tomorrow ?
do only i think that sasuke was wrong about lightening release that makes rasengan invincible ? ?
we 100 saw lightening around rasengan when boruto makes it invincible .
also there was two scenes where we saw a lightening:1 when boruto first time perform summoning jutsu and summoned nue 's tale which is looks like a snake 2 from jogan when boruto stops sumire and mitsuki and then they went into nue pocket dimension .
thus means lightening appears when boruto affect space-time summoning seeing portals and open pocket dimension and something tells me that vanishing rassengan work similar to a madara 's limbo but it is another dimension because otherwise momoshiki was able to sense it .
also there was an episode when naruto gift a kunai to a boruto that looks like a minato 's kunai but without of flying ryjin seal imo it might be a reference that boruto will be able to use space-time ninjutsu
here 's a theory on the history of the island
the universe is created by the zero point including 7 or more universes/dimensions
the meteor crashes down along with the visitor onto athena and the visitor is realesed by the government and creates a rocket at the villain lair '' using the hop rocks but something goes wrong or maybe he intended to but he creates the rift .
in the process damaging the zero point creating the loop .
something is going on with the big rift and lighting fires down creating the cube maybe they tried to overload the loop with that much storm energy this dosent work and they lose control of the cube and it is now just a block of darkness .
in an attempt to destroy the cube and its darkness one of the seven manages to blow it up but we are sent to another place maybe another dimension before being returned by the butterfly .
the iceberg crashes into the island with some unwanted guests .
the prisoner and who is known as the devourer .
the prisoner breaks free and creates a volcano to try take over athena .
the prisoner is defeated by probably the ice king and the government takes control over the volcano using it for research .
they find out a monster is on the map with them the devourer which escaped after the iceberg got hit by the volcano 's lava so they construct a robot to fight it using the power of the zero point in the vault to destroy the devourer .
the zero point is even more broken than before mixing the island from past present and future .
the seven get together and use the meteorite to contain the zero point but one of the seven die leading the meteorite in .
ego is sent in by the 6 to where the rocket crashed apollo they find a bunker and try to get in but are met by alter a team already on apollo
they start fighting over control of the island they realise soon that in battle they get corrupted .
alter tried healing scratch after his battle with 8 ball but he died to the corruption .
ego and alter are fighting less but taking control of more areas of the map and are now called ghost and shadow .
i think there is a third team that is neither ghost or shadow but they disguise as team ghost or shadow to gather intel and eventually they have to choose a side .
if anyone wants them it took a long while for me to get a 6 iv one so i have over a box of breedjects .
i have already added the little cuts around the clips but it did n't help .
so today i found royal bm 17 in alaska recovered it .
garage bugged afterwards i could not customize vehicles and stuff so i restarted the game .
not only my 120k royal bm 17 was not there it 's not anywhere on the map or other regions my chevy scout disappeared too ... any idea what to do here besides starting a new game ?
the government backed bounce back loans '' for small businesses have launched here 's the govt page about it https www.gov.uk/government/news/new-bounce-back-loans-to-launch-today .
basic version you can apply for a loan of 25 of last year 's turnover up to a max of £50,000 .
interest rate is locked at 2.5 no matter who you borrow from but obviously do check before you sign up for a loan !
there are no repayments to make in the first year .
this could be a useful buffer for those of us with limited companies who pay ourselves using mainly dividends which the chancellor implied made us dirty tax dodgers at the start of the covid-19 help which we could n't claim but it seems is an extremely common way to run your company what with it being completely within the treasury 's rules .
my business bank 's website has a page about it but the application page is not responding so i 'm guessing there 's a lot of interest in them !

i do n't see how you think that someone else texting them is in their control at all .
this is n't venting privately to your friends though .
this is publicly talking shit about your own child talking down on them for a fucking phone notification and bragging about how you 'd punish them for it .
i do n't see how any sane person kids or not could believe this is a reasonable way to treat your own kids .
thanks for calling me a sorry ass because being forced into family time is n't always enjoyable especially if i 'm referred to as a sorry ass or treated poorly because of what someone out of my control does .
call me a zoomer all you want it 's fine if that means i do n't emotionally abuse my kids and need to have complete control over their lives .
if you think of children as a burden for not being grateful of the bare minimum keeping them alive then maybe you should seek out a therapist .
reevaluate yourself because maybe there 's a reason some kids do n't want to be around parents like you .
really hoping and praying you do n't actually have kids and that you 're just a shitty troll .

i think you need to immediately ask you boyfriend about this if he has never given you a reason to not trust him there is no reason to jump to him cheating at this point .
by his reaction to you confronting him your gut will definitely tell you what 's going on !
i do not suggest trying to go detective mode and driving yourself crazy in my experience if cheating is happening you will know inside of yourself even if you do not have the proof .
after reading that julian 's post back when he posted it and these comments it honestly makes me feel bad for all of the guys on the show

folks who do n't know how to turn it down/off for a casual/easy game .
both players should talk before the game starts and make sure that they are on the same page .
if someone is prepping for a tournament and someone else is just looking for a fun game or is running a fluff list be clear about it up front .
folks who crush/destroy or lose patience with new players .
completing destroying them with a tourney list doesnt help build the hobby .
obviously do n't let them completely screw up or ignore rules but if they forgot to do something minor in phase let them correct it .

i have read the intro here but still need to do a final wash .
i 'm limiting how often i go to the store but wanted to get advice about what products seem to work for people who have hair similar to mine so i can stock up .
here i have just washed with hairitage gentle daily shampoo and squished to condish using their moisture restore conditioner then let it air dry .
i 'm especially interested in how to give some life to the top layer of my hair ... it has always been less curly than the underneath layers .
i had a better lineup than a dude in ranked last night little did he know the hitting slump im in .

it sounds super evil but it 's actually invisible ramps so that you do n't miss a portal or die because of modifications every wave as been spaced up by at least 1.3 the biggest spacing done is the x3 dual wave near the end at 2,1
for example in the very first wave if you go against the black death you can go on the most bottom part of the cube portal and die by smashing against the platform you 're supposed to not be able to miss .
another modification is that on the first mini ship i made the moving cubes into scale x0.70 and deleted most of them while removing the waved black death at the top and putting a plain black death instead .
i 'll eventually finish it and i 'll tell you .

it 's not that they are aggressive necessarily but just large and full of energy .
my niece has been knocked down more than a few times and hit her head once .
if you can get them trained by a good trainer you should n't have any issues as they 're very smart and will heed commands well .

noam chomsky is an anarcho sydicalist which is a form of anarchism .
i do n't think he 's misguided in his ideology .
in fact his vision of the future and theory of change are pretty similar to mine and i consider myself a staunch advocate of democratic socialism .
if you are thinking about anarcho capitalists then i agree those guys are so incredibly misguided .
but they definitely are not the same people as leftist anarchists .
how many videos of random dudes in their cars do we need ?

everyone wants a crystal ball answer but the truth is no one knows .
continue doing your research and if you come to your own conclusion of why xrp can succeed then go forward with risking fiat for an asset that can potentially be a bridge between all assets .
i think om another level its deeper than that .
these are the people that need routine need their status reaffirmed daily they need the system as is or they dont know how to function .
they use tv characters describe themselves they are in a feedback loop with advertising and marketing defining human interactions .
they are lost without the status quo because they have no imagination of any other way to live that isnt mad max or 1984 .
and these are the loudest minority using the global media apparatus to appear monumental and force their demands .

after playing ultimate for a while and trying melee for my first time ever it felt awful .
since i used to use two jump button shortcut for short hopping in ultimate i could n't short hop unless i was playing ganon in melee obviously i could n't l cancel and i could n't even use oos options since i was used to buffering them in ultimate .
going from ultimate where i could to what i wanted to melee the game feels awful at first .
for three or four months i only played against lvl 1 cpus training mode for like an hour every week .
eventually i got good enough to actually enjoy it and now i play netplay every so often and usually lose but sometimes take a win .
at this point i totally understand why and how melee can feel so much better than ultimate but remember how coming into it it felt choppy and no inputs would register .
would melee really be that fun for you if you could n't do rising aerials short hops wavedashes oos options and tilts most people use tilt stick in ultimate ?
you know our knowledge about this virus changes pretty much every day right ?

two groups of soldiers that serve for two nations that have for decades held fierce tensions between one another calmly crossing each other without even as speaking a single word to one another .
when we speak of the russian-us rivalry which ever way you might want to look at it trump and putin are the ones that come to mind when you think about it .
but in the end of the day it 's these group of soldiers who are simply doing their duty of serving their country that really represent each nation .

i could play any game i wanted at 144 fps
temporary e-mail well i guess my relationships are gon na last 10 minutes like the emails
early in the australian deployment to vietnam the 1st battalion royal australian regiment 1 rar operated with us forces .
in operation hump november 1965 and operation crimp january 1966 1 rar was attached to the us 173rd airborne brigade .
during operation hump 1 rar fought a battle alongside the us 1st battalion 503rd infantry regiment 1/503 although the dong nai river song dong nai separated the australian and us forces and their two battles remained separate .
in operation crimp 1 rar fought alongside 5 us battalions to locate and destroy a major viet cong headquarters and tunnel complex .
the operation was partly successful but the resources available were far from sufficient to deal with the 200km of tunnels .
1 rar played a key role due to the viet cong headquarters being in their area of operation .
in the battle of suoi bong trang february 1966 1 rar supported by a new zealand artillery battery fought attached to the us 1st division .
following this the australian and new zealand forces were separated from the us forces and with a second australian battalion and later also a third formed the 1st australian task force 1 atf in phuoc tuy province .
new zealand infantry were deployed in vietnam in 1967 and were integrated with the australian forces to form anzac battalions so in a technical sense anzac line units only formed after closely-integrated operation with us forces had ceased
the separation of us and australian forces was partly driven by differences in tactical/operational doctrine between the us and australian forces complicating working together and partly driven by an increased australian force making independent operation feasible .
australian and anzac forces still operated with us forces at times .
one notable battle was the post-tet two and a half month battle of hat dich december 1968 to february 1969 when 1 atf fought alongside us south vietnamese and thai forces .
this was a long and sprawling battle spread over 50km from north to south and the different forces had their own areas of operation so cooperation was not as close as when 1 rar fought attached to the us 173rd airborne and 1st division .
still us and thai artillery supported australian/anzac and arvn forces and australian/anzac ground forces fought alongside us and arvn ground forces on occasion during the battle .
so i 've only had these on for a couple days now and when i was searching through forums looking at people posting about getting bigger tires i also saw how some reprogrammed their speedo to accommodate .
but honestly i have n't noticed any drastic change in what the speedo is reading
i only notice this kind of thing if its really really obvious .
honestly for most fantasy settings that i 'm not super involved in i.e .
pretty much all of them i 'm not developing and that are n't long-running series i 'm typically happy if i can remember which country is which never mind what the specific geography is .
hope you are ... nothing worse than forced weirdness or awkwardness .
not as cute as people think ... be quirky organically
i doubt that we 'll ever get anything more than remasters even that 's a stretch but there 's a team called sunscorched studios who are making their own game called negative atmosphere that 's essentially a spiritual successor to dead space .
the sad part is that people totally fall for these kinds of things .
it 's funny how advertising works because everything that seems stupid and sounds like it would n't work totally does .
things like celebrity cameos totally work even though it seems like it should n't .
you 'd imagine it 'd be obvious that terry crews is totally getting paid to endorse old spice and his endorsement carries no weight but people fall for it and it fascinates me tbh
germany not because i dont believe you but because i wan na see something spicy
you should play the game the way you want ...
if you enjoy 1 you play that regardless of your rating .
i find lower levels easier to win as my opponent can not rely on his superstar players and i can play very slowly etc ...
in 2016 i beat everyone in my path with a 1 team ... .
this year i only played 3 4 but mostly 5 ... .
i mean i spent a great amount of time grinding and a good 200 bucks to get all my featured players ...
if you think having a 4500 team is an advantage boy you are wrong .
first of all 99.9 of my opponents teams are all 4300 with full featured players and legends .
secondly if the game gives the momentum to your opponent regardless of his skill he will score ... .
any player between ronaldo kane lewandowski aguero suarez will score from anywhere outside the box ...
the plastic we let out will end up like tye first wood that appeared millions of years ago .
since there 's nothing that can decompose it it will stay here and slowly turn back into a usable fuel source like wood turned into charcoal
would really like to know what items you used .

between trump this and the massive gap between rich/poor and black/white america is probably the worst country in the world .
that would be a great example if her point were it 's hard to publish books set in africa '' .
but her point is it 's easier to get a book set in black africa published if you 're white
it was the mid 2000s and at that time science fiction and fantasy publishers were not super interested in stories with black casts by black writers .
they had done some stories with black casts by white writers but they were not interested in those stories coming from people who actually were black. rejection letters would say things like we like this but we 're not sure how to market it .
we like this but we 're not sure who its audience would be”– the implication from publishers being that fantasy readers do n't want to read about black people .
it 's around 15 years after all since the killing moon was rejected across the board .
editors and publishers are now aware of the demand for inclusive representative fiction but – as a recent survey highlighted https blog.leeandlow.com/2020/01/28/2019diversitybaselinesurvey – us publishing is still blindingly white in terms of staffing .
and so there 's a strange and nasty tendency that 's developed for publishers to be perfectly ok with novels about certain groups of people written by white folks but not written by members of that group she says .
it 's still easier for a white person to write a book with an all-black cast set in fantasy africa and get it published than for a black person.
this is why you should have a destoner in your roastery .

gru and igor have the same bodyshape not counting the nose
they have a couple of 350s still on the website
i do not deny that it is too easy to make over generalized statements without support .
a lot of the time i ca n't remember which paper i read .
i 'm an analytical chemist with most of my attention on proteins and other cellular biopolymers .
it 's easy to see where the idea of dragons came from .
prehistoric people found skeletons that looked like giant birds with terrifying teeth .
the rock may have even had feather imprints ... implying to the unsophisticated that they flew .
but where did the common oral histories of things like elves dwarves giants etc come from .
my theory totally unsupported by anything is that it 's an oral history passed down from prehistory when the various races of man still coexisted and i mean what we call neanderthals bow legged cave dwelling dwarves homo erect is slim statured elves etc .
no idea but i like to believe it was anna louise 😊
ah i though everyone on youtube was a cringy pewdiepie supporters .
true but knowing how things work together from a more official source even if a leak would allow for further optimizations and maybe even correcting incorrect assumptions .
i agree mostly their communication is n't ever really visual though .
then again it is communication something they certainly value .

i do n't know but maybe things do happen for a reason .
always felt bad for chuck in this series he played incredible .
when the majority of people accept that abortion is not murder then attempting to ban abortion is illiberal .
not to mention that it 's a theocratic tendency .
you might as well be saying that people pushing for gun control are actually libertarians because they want to save lives .
cody as a commander is much more regimented and used to following orders from above no question and doing things by the book .
rex as an arc trooper is more of a creative and flexible soldier who is used to thinking outside the box and playing fast and loose with superior orders .
i think the main outcome was that if you financially support them each time then your barony is a beacon culture almost on par with pitax .
if you do n't support then your barony has a good culture but the best talent always leaves .
i like having the storyteller as minister of culture but always go against him and side with financing the arts .
i read it and still not clear if the death rate is being calculated based off the number of positive test results vs deaths or population vs test deaths ?

she was keen on burning the world down until teddy blew his brains out because she was going down a dark path that moved her away from dolores .
that 's why instead of deleting the sublime she kept it and beamed it out that 's when the plan for this season was set in motion because she knew outside forces would be after that data
edit also in s2 she pre-planned and printed the copies of herself and she would 've already had all the data for the humans like demspey caleb connells etc .
yes i read online that with dreams of someone who has passed away sometimes you communication through a note of by telephone instead of directly .
ive never had a dream with any one who has passed away in my life at least not vividly enough for me to remember ...
especially so strongly like this ... and with direct communication .
i do n't know if i would necessarily use the word tragic '' but basically she had a medical issue that is in the family that they were n't aware of and it killed her instantly without any signs of any issues .

that 's just a phrase red hats use to dismiss any criticism of trump .

the second edition planescape books are delightful to read independent of the old rule sets .
especially if you revealed a detailed description of the future events you could end up chamging literally everything except a few starting points .
growing up there was one guy in my neighbor who dealt and he had it made them he retired and moved to a beach still there i think .
but the guy across the street from me lives with his parents and drives a broke down car .
so much of a financial success that they wo n't make another one ?
they are a big reason the virus is spreading because i 've noticed a lot of them are not practicing social distancing or wearing masks .
if you want to everything to re open faster then you have to stop the spread .
like i understand she 's struggling but she was having money problems before she had the baby she knew what she could and could n't afford .
the guy told her to get an abortion and she 's still surprised he wo n't step up for him she basically tried to trap him which is why he dislikes her .

i reverse image searched it and i could n't find it anywhere before 2014 so that 's probably not true .
there are times when i just want to put them both in time out so i can get a break haha .
i am glad that persistence pays off in this case !
lots of toys scattered everywhere and tupperware full of treats in every area of our place right now .
please no spoilers for season 5 but i started watching the show not long ago and just got to the season 4 finale and i kind of agree with you op .
the serialized plot is extremely interesting and i 'm really looking forward to seeing what happens but i initially fell in love with the show because it was just a cool procedural where they save people and get up to hijinx every episode but you know everything is going to be fine by the end .
once it gets into the bigger plot the show gets a lot more stressful .
if you 're comfortable changing the plugs yourself it 's something you can do for relatively cheap if you 're picking some up at the store get a can of maf sensor cleaner and a new engine air filter while you 're at it .
that being said my 03 ' performance 6mt with 93,000 miles will occasionally have a intermittent misfire on startup you can hear and feel when it bogs down either pending or pulling a p0300 random intermittent misfire '' code .
sometimes it 's very subtle like yours and other times the engine will be very rough and sound like a subaru .
i 'm taking it to my mechanic tomorrow to have a look over once i get some info from them i 'll post an update on my comment .

there was a post a while back of a frame where kobe does an interview on mj for the documentary too

posting this because i wan na know if anyone else feels this .
i 'm not as good at tetris as most really hardcore '' guys but i 'd say i 'm above average and can play pretty well competitively with 1-2 pps and i know some setups .
anyway i was watching someone play puyo puyo tetris as a lets play thinking it would be fun but man was i wrong .
watching them play was like nails on a chalkboard .
i literally wanted to yell at my computer screen do n't put it there '' .
it probably has something to do with how you train your brain to recognize all these helpful patterns and when the pattern is n't completed it hurts .
if you are thinking this sounds like an asshole thing to do yes i am an asshole .
my best friend that saved me from depression made me laugh when i was down and had always cared about me i literally just tossed away because of a gut feeling .
i 'm not really sure if this confession is going to help me feel any better or even if it should but yeah i suck .
i wish i could say why i did it .
although i gave some very specific and logical reasons prepared for why i could n't see her anymore in a way it was a little bit deceptive because im still not sure why i did it it was n't a fight or anything i more placed the blame all on me .
sometimes i enter these trances this is n't code for drugs and suddenly have an epiphany of sorts or an odd inclination to do something .
but after i left this trance i suddenly had the desire more than ever to leave the relationship .
im not one to leave or join relationships on whims and in fact i think most of the friends i 've had i 've kept my eye on them for about a year before approaching and initiating .
and i do n't think i 've ever left a friend before mainly because im so careful picking them out .
in this trance or whatever you may call it although i was thinking about our relationship i have literally no idea what specifically i thought about .
and then when i snapped back to consciousness i had this strong urge to leave my friend although i have no idea why i felt this way .
and its not like i do n't care about them .
and i think they know that and they are probably super confused and depressed right now .
i still cried so much that it probably seemed like she was the one that dumped me .
despite feeling genuinely crappy about it i do n't regret it .
in a way i feel relieved somehow despite all the sadness .
and that 's the part that makes me feel like genuine scum .
who would dump their best friend on just a gut instinct ?
am i losing it or did anyone else just catch a meteor sailing over the river from uptown to the west bank ?
yes i 'm in a very bad mood sorry to those whose day i just ruined .
my girlfriend has been gone for a while and i 'm lonely and restless and stuck in my head and i just saw a post about someone getting a load of acheivements in just one year because of medicine .
my parents support me well or at least try extremely hard .
i have many opportunities to do better in school .
i go to a fucking private school my family has lots of money and support to give .
fuck me fuck my life i 'm not using any of what 's mentioned above .
hi guys i 'm about to finish undergrad and i have about 1.5 months before i start working as an entry level software developer for a finance firm .
do you have any suggestions for how i can best prepare for this ?
i 'm getting increasing fears about shitting the bed when i start working maybe from imposter syndrome but also because my job description is still kind of vague at the moment .
do you know of any other online courses or resources i can review ?
i was originally going to travel with my free time but that 's not happening now so i might as well make some use of it !
i 'm planning on browsing through mit 's missing semester of your education course .
i think the score was fantastic i think it perfectly pairs with the somber feeling of the original score of order 66 .
perhaps it 's just because my doggo is n't doing very well right now ... but i 'm not sure i 'll be able to watch this again without crying .
so i have those ugly non halo headlights on my new 230i and i want to upgrade to halos .
after market ones are impossible to find and i 've seen some oem halos on ebay for cheap but they have broken tabs or cracked glass .
is cheap or possible to replace those tabs or worth it to replace the glass ?
also if you 're trying to sell your headlights message me i will buy them !
thank you so much to our hardworking observers for both contenders owl and tournaments like fran 's !
i 've noticed especially lately some amazing catches and shots such as nosmite 's primal boop on volskaya and lip 's kill onto fits ' translocator on oasis .
hi all just got connected to nbn today through aussie broadband .
for some reason they never sent or charged me for the router which i should have followed up on earlier but now instead i 'm looking for router suggestions .
should i aim to get the same model as aussie broadband were providing or is there anything that might be better or more suitable for my situation 2 people using internet for online gaming and streaming all through wifi devices are too far for lan to be convenient and we have a medium sized apartment that is n't very open .
if someone could help me out by suggesting an optimal router for my situation id greatly appreciate it .
edit forgot to add it 's a fttc nbn connection .
i was thinking of trying to start getting some additional income by doing small projects on the side .
do you guys utilize your skills to make bonus income ?
if so how did you start and what was your journey like .
apologies in advance i 'm aware there 's a school list thread but it did n't seem like anyone was getting very many responses .
i was planning to apply last year but due to unforeseen circumstances and my lack of research experience i decided to push back applying to this year .
therefore i have a bit of a tentative list left over from last year 's application and i 'm not sure if it needs to be revised .
i mostly based my list on stats/oos acceptance data from msar but it 's been a bit tricky since i have unbalanced stats and a rather basic application otherwise standard ecs .
year in school graduated in 2018 w double major neuroscience/psychology from umich i 'm 23/f/orm
other potential schools emory brown rochester miami cincinnati usf morsani georgetown bostonu tufts philly schools temple jefferson drexel
also definitely interested in cali schools never been a cali resident but my older siblings live there but not sure where to start .
was thinking ucla ucsf ucsd some obvious reaches but they at least accept a few oos
other reaches '' no idea where to start here i basically want to avoid any schools i would have 0 chance of getting accepted to so in that way these schools are mostly all the same to me but i obviously still want to include a good amount on my list
600 hours 1k projected hours ra for cdc-funded flu vaccine effectiveness study covid-19 surveillance i worked full-time identifying/recruiting/consenting/swabbing lol patients w flu symptoms in a clinic along with the associated data entry/paperwork/specimen handling .
i now work remotely same general idea except i 'm now recruiting patients with respiratory symptoms over the phone and we 've switched focus from flu to covid .
definitely staying on with the study until at least the end of july this was determined pre-covid but might be longer than that .

i am guessing y and z are basically rx tx if so are we just talking about crestron 's own repackaged 'serial ' here ?
assuming i am correct or even close to correct would that not mean if we knew what the cresnet strings/packets/data were we could make some kind of raspberry pi to serial '' setup that could speak cresnet '' provide the 24v separately or maybe through a poe setup on the pi and boom poe cresnet .
i do n't have a specific example of gear but i was potting my emblem earlier and i had a very clear example of this .
i rolled 6 dex and it gave me around 50k range next pot i got 6 str my main stat and it said it would only give me 28k range i made very sure that there were no other lines that would have affected the range i 'm pretty sure both rolled with hp as the second and third lines or some crap idk .
i put a picture of my equips and stats if anyone could help me understand why this is happening another thing i 'm really confused about my nova boots have 55 str and 6 str pot but when i equip them my stat only goes up by 55 it basically disregards the pot ?
any input would be really appreciated as to why this is happening and if i can do anything about it or if i 'm just being stupid .
thanks i get 1500 str from arcanes idk if that matters
had a discussion with a friend related to cars when two chemistry questions came up .
if you have water that is saturated with a salt nacl for example in a container and then pour petrol or diesel in the container what happens ?
1. does the salt stay in the water mix or does it seperate from the water and goes to the fuel ?
if you remove evaporate the fuel and then the water from the container would the salt start to appear again when the water is over-saturated reappear ?
or would the petrol have contaminated the salt so it would have lost it properties/become hazardous or something like that ?
long time ago i studied chemistry so thanks in advance p
yes these are thoughts of a game that 's like a decade old but it recently went on sale so some people may consider picking it up and i had already been playing it again anyway .
it 's actually one of my favorite games in the franchise but it 's not without its problems .
like many jrpgs for every step forward it takes it seems to take another step backwards .
there are elements here that are head scratching at best but i dont know if i would call the game outright offensive but they might be questionable to some .
so with that said let 's get the elephant out of the room first .
this is something that most people will be highly confused over .
there are a range of cultures depicted in ffxii but nearly all of them are eurocentric .
there isnt even a character you could charitably call asian '' in a game that was developed in japan .
while it 's not really anything new for a jrpg to have a predominantly white cast there 's usually an area or culture that 's extremely influenced by japan at the least .
sure theres a samurai class and some katana laying about but that 's about it .
in the game itself we see three human cultures and they 're all represented by white people .
archaedes at least makes sense its clearly modeled on a roman/european structure its naming conventions at least all sound european and so on .
the other two we see dalmasca and rozzaria are on shakier ground .
we only see a handful of people from there and they most definitely are n't white its definitely based on some sort of historical culture think spanish empire mixed with moorish spain but our sample size is less than ten people .
the nobility the citizens and everything in between is white all the way down .
it 's a culture that 's rooted in turkey .
the developers literally took a trip to turkey and took pictures because they wanted to accurately capture the culture of the region .
i mean you can argue that vaan is a shade of brown but only sometimes and depending on lighting .
you can also claim that maybe squeenix had too heavy of a hand in the direction and they did but more on that momentarily and forced the team to make dalmasca more marketable that is more white but that 's conjecture .
the truth is square had a prime opportunity to feature a cast that was predominantly middle eastern looking and squandered it .
given the game was made during the zenith of when people of that region were targeted unfairly i mean they still are but it was worse back then it would have been a nice change of pace .
i 'm not going to say it was maliciously racist of them .
i never chalk something up to maliciousness when incompetence or capitalism or ignorance makes more sense and in the case of this one those last two are far more likely .
fortunately we have non human races that are n't treated like wild animals .
historically in fantasy non human races are used to depict other ethnicities and its the same here .
i 'm not smart enough to parse out what cultures they represent but i am able to see that none are particularly vilified or held in high regard .
in fact the only place that seems to have a problem with the non human races is the aforementioned archaedes empire the antagonists .
they 're the only kingdom that treats the other races with contempt .
so step backward in terms of representation step forward in terms of showing that people are in fact people and treating them badly makes you a bad person .
i 'm not going to go into excruciating detail about all the major players here only instead focusing on our six playable characters since they 're the ones we see the most of .
also if i went into great detail about the antagonists we would be here all day .
unfortunately penelo is our one character who falls flat .
she has some importance in the first act then kinda drops off .
this actually isnt the writers fault one in particular had a lot written for her all of which was cut via orders from up the ladder so she gets the least development .
it 's a shame too because you can see even early on she was to share vaan 's role .
fran has a subplot in the second act that gets rushed to completion presumably due to time constraints .
a lot of exposition on viera culture got recycled into ffxiv along with most of fran 's plot so she too is sadly underdeveloped .
i will say that despite her massive amounts of fan service they dont actually call a lot of attention to it in story .
fran dresses the way she wants and no one calls attention to it or takes issue with it .
that 's kind of milquetoast nowadays but when the game came out it was actually kind of interesting that they did n't spend exorbitant amounts of time focusing on her ass .
the most controversial character because a lot of people dont understand why vaan is even in this story .
he provides a ground level view in a story that 's mostly about knights and nobility vaan is just a kid but a commoner too .
he humanizes people the cast probably would n't think about .
he gives a voice to people who are n't nobles .
sure he 's in many ways your stereotypical jrpg protagonist but i will argue without his voice the cast would feel less human .
i put these two together because their place in the story is about the same .
our leading men provide an interesting dynamic one is former noble of some sort the other a knight .
they both left the empire for their own reasons took vastly different journeys and their relationship with the women they 're attached to not romantically in a refreshing change of pace takes up significant portions of their character .
i mean i guess you could argue balthier and fran are a thing but the game leaves this ambiguous and neither one ever pines for the other .
both call into question the merits and pitfalls of the systems they are loyal to and shirk .
archaedes is definitely vile and neither seem particularly heartbroken about leaving it behind .
balthier started looking out only for himself but he when he does his roguish talking down it 's not because of the obvious reasons .
his clashes with ashe in particular are n't because she 's a woman it 's because she 's so focused on revenge it clouds her judgement .
he 's an ass but he never does anything i would consider bad .
it 's always a problem when someone supports their land right or wrong but he 's the only noble we see show concern to those beneath him on the social ladder .
he declares in act 2 that he would bear any shame '' to protect the people which is pretty heroic in the chivalry sense .
to conjecture i would guess he was brought up from the lower classes in his homeland but i cant remember if that was a thing or i just made it up .
the character most people seem to agree to be the main character of the story .
a lot of what she does and says is more typical of male protagonists in this genre .
coming from a woman it doesnt feel out of place .
her plotline of wanting revenge against a tyrannical nation never dovetails into no but imperialism is actually a good thing '' and while she decides that using weapons of mass destruction is in fact a bad thing she never stops fighting to avail her country of the empire .
but moreover something that ashe does well is that she 's never depicted as weak because she 's a woman .
her moments of weakness come from things that are n't tied to one gender .
her anger at losing her loved ones and her drive to free her people isnt tied to her gender .
but talking about ashe also leads into the main themes of the story .
the only final fantasy that 's mostly about ... politics.
final fantasy has never been shy about politics or taking stances on things that people will argue about .
final fantasy vii had a hard anti-capitalist pro-environment message x basically said religion and blind faith will end the world and xii is no different .
the primary themes of ffxii are about revenge anti-imperialism and independence .
ashe is driven by revenge vaan too though he gets over his more quickly against a system that broke her family and took her throne .
that 's not exactly a great message until you look at dalmasca as a whole .
they might be the least imperial kingdom i 've ever seen .
there 's never talk about expanding its borders only pushing back against other imperial expansion .
from what little we see in terms of world maps dalmasca has had the same borders for seemingly forever .
if there is expansion it must be very small and done without force .
but even then we are never told that ashe is a good person for being a noble .
she 's a good person because she 's pushing back against an empire .
in fact the game goes out of it 's way to show you that most nobility will do whatever it takes to retain their hold on their power .
people like ashe are a rarity not the norm .
the game often gets a lot of praise for showing its villains as complex and it does for the most part ... but it also shows that their greed and lust for more power still plant them firmly as bad people .
i guess the ultimate point i 'm making is ... if you can forgive its missteps ffxii i 'd actually a really good story about the evils of nobility imperialism and why wanting to take revenge against an empire isnt a bad thing .
i sort of lost the plot a bit and rambled .
but i think this is a game you should at least give a look .
i did n't go into gameplay or anything like that because you do n't have a free hour and i only have two thumbs .
so is this a recommendation or a tearing down of this game ?
if you 're looking for interactive teletherapy activities i have created some fun boom cards you might like to check out .

i have read that if people come water your flowers there is a much higher chance of hybrids forming .
some of my flower plots are so stubborn and it takes forever to get the colors i want .
i feel bad having my friends water 150 flowers lol ...
it 'd be awesome if groups existed of people all hoping to grow new colors etc .
we could exchange our extra flowers water on each other 's islands and even tip each other ... .
anyone know of anything like this or would you be interested in joining a group of acnh gardeners ?

there are few things as erotic to me as a freshly gaped hole .
i adore watching my handiwork slowly tighten back up my partner breathing deeply and in post orgasm bliss .
which hole i stretch makes no difference i just want to fit larger and larger things inside you until you 're a quivering mess .
do you want someone with experience to guide you through unlocking your inner size queen ?
i 'll happily be the key that opens you up irl or online .
i can do so through a dom/sub dynamic or just be an enthusiastic play partner helping you train your hole of choice .
i 'm also interested in rp'ing a scene that involves stretching either hole .
we can use fingers beer bottles hands bad dragon toys inflatable plugs or all of the above .
the instrument used is n't as important to me as the end result .
the scene does n't have to be focused entirely on stretching either .
i 'm into a wide variety of kinks and would like to incorporate anything else that you feel would help the scene or your enjoyment .
my only limits for this are scat blood gore excessive pain spanking and the like are okay and feet so go buck wild if you 're inclined to do so .
if this is something up your alley message me with what you 're looking for and other kinks you may want to add .
i 'm also down for some kinky games as well if you 're feeling competitive !
i feel like my meds are not helping me enough .
i recently had to go off of lamictal because i had a rash not the rash but my doctor wanted me completely off of it .
i just feel like i 'm experiencing something that i have n't experienced in a very long time .
i 've been sleeping a lot but i 've also had a lot of energy to go and do things .
i 've been spending a lot of money but i 've been justifying it .
i just bought a macbook pro because i needed a new laptop anyways and i bought some new clothes .
i want to cry scream crawl out of my skin but i want to get up and dance around the room at the same time .
i 'm so irritable and want to bite everyone 's heads off too !
i 've been isolating myself because i do n't want to get into any arguments with my loved ones but i 'm just so frustrated .
i contemplated calling my psychiatrist but i hate bothering him .
i have a telepsych appointment with him on friday but i feel like that 's too far away !
i also do n't know if this is n't just all due to the quarantine .
what would you do if you were in my shoes ?
i need any extra ha corsola if someone has breed any of those ?
i dont have much but i 'm sure we can work something out .

i 'm looking for some friends in new leaf never added anyone before so i 'd like to explore this part of the game .
i 've already tried various methods of eliminating it turning off freesync disabling hdcp messing with the voltageswing and preemphasis nothing .
have n't been able to find much live footage/recordings from the before today era if you have anything please send it my way !
especially want to hear little wig live its one of my faves and the closest ive found is this cover by some random japanese high school kids https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wvckimcu8rw https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wvckimcu8rw
so i 've been working on a dual 12av6 boost/preamp/overdrive circuit based off of the valvecaster circuit with some minor modifications aside from using what is essentially two halves of a 12ax7 for tubes said mods are explained further on and i do n't know why it 's doing what i 'm about to explain .
so if i plug my bass into the low gain input which bypasses the first tube or first the stage and goes to the second stage or output side it works perfectly and actually provides a nice little bit of saturation/compression/limiting .
but when i plug into the high gain input the plate of the first tube feeding the grid of the second i get this really bad farty clipped sound and it 's just half off the sinewave i know this because i 've tested it going into an oscilloscope vst plugin in my daw .
both stages use the following circuit please excuse my poorly drawn diagram it 's the best i could do unfortunately https i.imgur.com/ouesyvw.png https i.imgur.com/ouesyvw.png this is the datasheet for the 12av6 http www.r-type.org/pdfs/6av6.pdf http www.r-type.org/pdfs/6av6.pdf and this is the circuit i 'm basing this thing off of http www.hgamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pre.png http www.hgamps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pre.png the only other difference between the original vavlecaster circuit and my modded one is both halves of my modded circuit the one i drew out are identical .
so i reciently restored my pc because vr on iracing keep giving me headaches ... now it is a blast ... rock solid but suddently i found a problem that has put down my rating by a ton .
my problem is that mid race last time on the first lap of the qualy the wheel suddently disconects and reconects with thay carasteristic windows sound tututum titutin '' and starts calibrating .
no need to explain what happens on the sim ... straight into a wall if everyone els is lucky ... yesterday i took out half the grid on the start
i reinstalled rebooted prayed get mad at my luck swear and ... well that was pretty much what i did ... anyone has experienced something similar ?
i rode on the web sonething about checking the power management usb concentratora and unchecking the allow windows to shut down this device to save energy '' checkbox ... so i did it on the ts-pc and every ither usb hub ... still to test after that ... but i dunno ... what do you think ?
it is a nightmare because i really want to race ... but ... it is not fair to my rating to drop like that neither for the rest of drivers .
but the fact is that it never happens on practice ... maybe following the power management logic ... it only triggers the usb hub power saving mode when the processor and gpu are at high demand ?
i got the huge miniatures paint decanting set and started but the tutorial seemed off to me .
i used the recommended 10-15 drops of flow improver but instead of the extremely liquify consistency that was shown in the video my paint ended up more gel like .
it was definitely softer but nowhere near as thing as in the video .
did i do something wrong like shaking too little or and i supposed to add more flow medium ?
i 'm trying to get some new items for my house !
i have a p55 setup and i 'm looking for old parts that will drastically increase performance such as an over clocking motherboard or any water cooling setup that 's been tested and sitting around .
please comment if it 's something you want to get out of your closet .
i do n't know what i 'm looking at .
pretty sure i imported lr 's catalog into c1 20 for sony .
i never really understood why i even need a catalog at all ca n't c1 just reflect windows file explorer ?
here https imgur.com/a/goxdfpq is a screenshot of what i see when i navigate my computer 's folders in c1 's library module .
on the left the question mark next to the bracket in blue represents all the things i do n't understand and have never used .
on the right i have indicated my confusion over why it tells me i have 109,780 images in something called catalog collections '' and it also says i have 0 images in catalog .
i have only ever put my images from the card into a folder named for that shoot 's date and subject .
i have never simply dumped images into one huge folder .
that is to say i have a pre-existing organizational system that looks an awful lot like sessions .
one camera one windows pc no laptop no on-the-go editing no tethering no flags notes or metadata outside exif data .
i just occasionally like going through old shoots and finding overlooked stuff and re-editing other shots .
i am not interested in a sophisticated data management system .
i am more than happy with a simple folder structure just like any document on my pc .
more than half the questions on this sub are so over my head i 'm lost by the third or fourth word of the question so i am not very sophisticated a photographer .
all i know is i want c1 to reflect my hd 's folders .
i had my own system long before this program and i 'd like to keep it .
i 'm not sold on sessions either i know how to make my own sub folders with windows and i can name them whatever i want .
if i want to have 3 separate export folders i can make them .
no need to use the cookie cutter c1 folder array .
i will decide how many sub folders i need and what to name them per shoot .

i 'm looking for woman to share stories/pictures/ideas with .
shoot me a message and tell me a little about yourself .
i am watching a failed cop show called deputy and in s1e7 a doctor character literally says to this lesbian well look obviously i understand biology .
she did n't even say gender she said sex .
how can any person real or fictional say i understand biology '' and then go on to say there is more than two sexes ? ? ?
or gender which to normal folks means the same thing .
there is a lot more of this pc nonsense in this show which is why it got such horrible ratings but this is the bit that got me worked up .
it 's making america and the west in general more divisive and it is hurting younger generations .
i 'm playing at the part of the story where you travel to rhodes with dutch and he says no weapons .
i already did the train scene and brought the guy back to the sheriff .
dutch asked if i still wanted to go fishing i said no and after they left my mini map disappeared .
also i 've already closed the game and got back on but it did n't help .

the spiciest of all myamyrs has entered the fray meet cilantro !
description a true party animal cilantro is an excitable myamyr that is in constant need of attention .
whether he 's dancing with his friends or sharing his latest batch of peppers with his foes cilantro is always ready to turn up the heat !
in battle cilantro shares celebratory dishes with friends and foes alike inflicting a unique status effect spicy !
cilantro possesses a unique element that allows him to apply a new effect called spicy .
this can be applied to himself his allies and his enemies .
spicy is activated when an ability is used as that ability will consume stacks of spicy based on it being basic special or ultimate .
consuming stacks of spicy will increase hero speed but can also inflict burn !
for example if a hero has five stacks of spicy at the start of their turn
using a basic ability will consume one stack reducing stacks to four and grant the hero 10 speed up for one turn .
using a special ability will consume two stacks reducing stacks to three and grant the hero 20 speed up and burn for one turn .
using an ultimate ability will consume three stacks reducing stacks to two and grant the hero 30 speed up for 2 turns as well as burn for 2 turns .
note that ability effects are limited by the number of stacks available this means that using an ultimate ability would instead apply 20 hero speed and burn for one turn if that hero only has two stacks of spicy to consume .
after each 24 hour season of muy catliente pvp you will be placed in a league based on your success and the trophies that you earn .

i asked them on r/neoliberal r/libertarian and r/askaliberal i also tried to ask this on a couple of other subreddits like r/conservative and r/republican but they would n't let me post it .
7 more suggested we need amendments most having to do with election reform abolish electoral college or make it proportional constrain gerrymandering ensure elected officials put nation before party campaign finance limits increase number of house members institute wyoming rule that would more or less make the smallest congressional district equal in size to the smallest state eliminate senate because it is anti-democratic and term limits .
5 of the ys 5 of the ns and 2 others said something like but we ca n't because the other side will screw it up somehow. 2 of the ys 1 of the ns and 1 other essentially said but it is currently impossible to change .
5 are of the opinion that this is about the best constitution possible while 2 think the basic construction is sound so it is unnecessary to alter it .

in s1 e9 we find out malvo has been posing as a dentist for 6 months .
how do you pose as a dentist for 6 months ?
he also seems to own a very expensive looking house .
i guess he could be renting but that would mean he 's signed a lease of some sort .
he 's also engaged but okay i guess he can murder her when he needs to .
and all of that to murder a witness for 100k .
and also it seemed ridiculous that lester would insist on pushing this guy who he knows is a psychopathic killer .
i know its the new '' lester but still ridiculous .
lets put an undercover hitman who you 've murder people up against the wall and then hit him in the head just hard enough to piss him off after he has just murdered three people .
this is probably talked about a lot but i thought i 'd give my input
i played a game today where i spawned in the sightlines of the top player 9 times then in basically beside a guardian in their super twice more .
i 'm surprised that whatever decides spawn put me there instead of literally anywhere else on endless vale .
like hey i 've died three times by the right c flag so how about you put me into the open area behind a ?
nah it 'll just put me inside c instead of on the cliffside and cause me to almost instantly die .

looking to pay off loan by watering peoples flowers 😊
she was n't fired because her son is a psycho .
she was fired because she was on the same videos with her son that was saying these crazy things and laughing with him never disagreeing or criticizing anything he ever said .
thus she was fired because she was their employee on holocaust denying videos and videos that said a lot of other crazy things .
so why would you want an employee who represents your company on these videos working for you ?
it makes it look like the company also agrees with it because they are employing people who condone this behavior !
companies can fire and hire who ever they want .
why would you want to hire someone who would make your company look bad ?
so i just had an aha moment today and wanted to verify it with people before i considered it canonical .
so i have a master bare metal node and i realized that all it is is a kubelet with a set of manifests for the kubernetes control plane .
the kubelet keeps those control plane components up and running all the time .
so the architecture for a worker node and a master node is all the same the only difference is the pods that are being run .
sry i could n't put more but it would n't let me
asking for advice i ca n't find good app to suit my needs
should build training plan and adjust it based on my progress or lack of it
i should be able to choose equipment i have available at home like bosu pull-up bar but base is still bodyweight
should support landscape mode i train in front of tv so always cast my screen to appletv .
should support exporting to apple health not mandatory but nice to have since i use apple watch
freeletics 12-week training journeys no landscape mode export to apple health is really weird for every session it creates 3-4 entries some of them are 0:00 long no 3-5 sec rest between exercises so i have time to adjust my pose or run to pull-up bar etc .
overall i find sessions here weird since session consists of 3-4 sub-sessions ... . why not have it as one big session ? ?
adidas training 12-week plan no landscape mode but has standalone appletv app yes no available equipment '' setting training plan is quite intense but only 8-10 minutes long i would prefer to have slightly lighter but 20-30 min sessions .
nike training club has good landscape mode but no equipment setting ...
right now looking at fitbod and shred '' but have n't tested them yet ... maybe there are even better options ?
i can see it was designed mostly for gym clients ...
when you start a workout nothing happens just small timer appears .
no videos on the screen to follow along just place to enter reps/sets ...
i would prefer an app with real-time video guidance like other apps i mentioned above .
for some reason i ca n't login to xgp on my pc .
all attempts to sign in just make this blank pop-up https i.imgur.com/2x7ypaj.png appear which i assume is meant to be the sign-in page but nothing ever actually loads .
the same blank pop-up appears when you try to sign in when already in-game .
everything is up to date and i reinstalled the app too .
what 's weird is that i can sign in to the mobile companion app and the companion app is clearly synced to my pc because i can initiate downloads through my phone .
but the desktop app still wo n't actually sign in .
because right now i literally ca n't play any games and it 's annoying seeing as this is a service that i pay for .
i mentioned this on another post but personally i 'd say sell everything .
when the new event comes out do nothing but play event games every second you can to get the reward as quickly as possible then sell it .
sell the boss you unlock and every time you get a pack sell everything worth more than 200 stubs .
none sellable rewards will usually let you field a competitive team but if you need some help try to buy low and rent a good card then sell when his price goes up .
this is what i 've been doing and i need only the rockies and nl east to finish the collection .
plus i kept hanley ramirez at least until i get the other 70k for arenado ...
i 'm a pet who too wishes to give my master the best rimming possible .
i actually was sent this from my master who found it and knew i would 1 enjoy the embarrassment i would get from seeing the post and 2 probably seek out the answer to your question as well .
based on my experience i think what helps me most is the verbal ques and commands he gives me during .
not only is it fun to be told how to do something in that sense but it 's also genuinely helpful .
maybe making nonverbal command ques that have verbal equivalents might help ?
such as showing a palm to stop or wagging a finger to order you to change what style of licking you 're doing .
i know that i also work from a pet mindset less than a standard submissive/slave mindset so the way commands are given may be received differently .
lastly to wrap this up lick at him like a fucking puppy who 's excited to see their owner .
try moving your head with it to give it more force or the opposite move just your tongue for a gentler style of lick .
experiment with using your tongue pressed flat for broader licks i prefer doing those slowly or point your tongue outward more for more precise and smaller licks this also helps for inserting your tongue deeper .
i hope this helped and i hope other people can share their own experiences to help us both lol
ahhh my favorite type of a san diego reddit thread .
when is newsom going to open the state im going to die if i cant go to the beach
governor we 're going to try this gradually and see as soon as this friday
dropped out of college to work at the university power plant .
i make roughly 70k in central pa with good benefits so i guess it worked out .
do you think the insanely fast infrastructure on which the market operates is free to use ?
i think you 're referring to morning after pills .
you take them immediately if your condom breaks or leaks .
condoms are not a 100 guarantee so it 's normal for people to want to take extra measures to prevent unwanted pregnancy .
morning after pills you can get them prescribed at pharmacies or clinics and you must take them within 24 hours or as soon as possible for them to take effect .
what it does it 'll either delay ovulation to prevent fertilization if you have been inseminated or prevent implantation if not mistaken .
not categorized as abortion so everyone needs to take a chill pill !
also i read it 's not advisable for you to take morning after pills every time you have sex if that 's what you 're thinking !
as they 're not a 100 guarantee on prevention either .
only effective perhaps 90 and it could make your hormones wonky or worse barren if taken too often but you do your own research about this .
it 's pretty easy to dodge you hear her ult hear it coming and can plan accordingly .

i 've passed exam p fm ifm and now i 'm going to start studying for mas-i .
i used coaching actuaries for the first 3 exams and passed on my first try .
however since ca does not have their manual/adapt fully completed i was wondering what other study materials would people recommend ?
any advice for studying for this exam would be appreciated .
it 's a bit scarier now to be moving on from the fundamental exams .
they ought to mention shelton training with brock to be more ready for a guy like lashley
i think the real story is how a dog played video games and communicated with a human .
i love and hate it it 'll be more fun when the dumb sabers go ... ...
i do n't know how to react to the no because they clearly identified they do not care about laws public safety or being a decent human .
what do you say to that other than a very unproductive and adrenaline increasing f*ck you ?
i 've already checked they are all out of stock i mentioned them specifically in my description
in real world software development we can actually see what 's going on by adding a debugger or outputting something to the console .
what am i supposed to do in a scenario where i ca n't reproduce a test that he is throwing an error on but is n't happening for me locally ?
it 's really hard to decipher what 's going on if i ca n't get in there and see what 's happening .
i 'm most likely going to have to drop this class since i ca n't figure this one issue out thus blocking me from moving forward .
i 'm hoping to quit smoking as that 's mostly addiction and a drain on my money .
drugs on the other hand as someone who likes psychedelics i cant reccommend them enough .
it 's a beautiful experience and significantly less risky than most drugs including alcohol
the fact that while she was asleep having no power over her body bled through her pad ?
that an already emotional and physically painful time made worse and embarrassing left a stain on the bed ?
peroxide will take care of it but if you are n't okay with how the female body functions and the occasional stain maybe do n't date women .
what 's really depressing is that is voter approval rating does n't seem to change 35 or 45 .

i got my mini from the offer in january because i use google fi .

gon na sound weird but thinking about some ford calls .
yta situations like this make it harder for actually disabled people to get accommodations in the workplace .
when your employer finds o it and they will it plants a seed of doubt in their mind .
next time someone requires accommodations they are going to wonder in the back of their minds if this is another scam .
that might impact how that future employee gets treated .
and all because you like the sympathy you get when you carry a cane .
there 's a page called service trucks '' on facebook and it 's super helpful it 's full of older dudes that have started where you are now .
i threw my phone in the bin by mistake once
yes this i remember being so scared to tell my husband i loved him and then he said it and my awkward ass says me too '' .
i could n't understand why he was mad at me and the next night i was cooking dinner with our boys i did n't live with him yet but because we both had boys the same age we kinda dated in house and i told my son i loved him and he was like k you too '' .
i was like god that pisses me off ! ''
my then boyfriend was like yeah you 've said that before i guess i never got that until now '' .
it took me a minute but i dropped the spatula and grabbed him i kissed him and looked him in the eyes and told him i loved him and knew i was going to spend the rest of our life together .
the cutest moment no where special the kitchen of the house we still live in 16 years later .
i adore him still he is amazing you have to let them know always .
coped alright in michigan but got stuck just enough times that i sold it .
it has come to mean this to us but really capitalism just means that the capital its name sake is the driving force .
capital can have many different forms and a capitalism with a debt based currency is completely different from one with a resource based currency or an expiring currency ... its like how a dolphin is technically a mamal like us .
the opinion seems pretty clear and consistent to me .
the court found the analysis flawed because it found that the eas analyzed things other than the specific complaints about the effect on groundwater and the cumulative impact of the combined leases that were raised by the plaintiffs resulting in a failure to conduct the required analysis of those specific complaints .
many of the citations on which blm relies prove irrelevant to wildearth 's specific complaints .
a weatherman proves unhelpful if he says it 's going to be windy tomorrow when asked if it will rain .
the rest of blm 's responses prove similarly deficient as blm merely recites a list of facts about hydraulic fracturing spills without providing specific responses to wildearth 's complaints about the potential role of shallow fracturing and surface casing depth in fracturing spills .
all of these statements mirror wildearth original complaints regarding what role shallow fracturing and surface casing depth will play in spills and how will groundwater be affected .
our erstwhile weatherman proves similarly unhelpful when he says it 's going to rain after someone asks how much it will rain tomorrow .
he hits closer to the mark than he did with his windy response but not close enough.
blm provided no catalogue here and little analysis to show the combined environmental impacts .
as wildearth points out the individual eas for butte billings and hiline include no discussion of each other even though all three eas covered land sold in the same lease sale .
further the miles city lease sale contains no discussion of the environmental impacts from the other three eas.
the problems with blm 's eas largely relate to the absence of analysis rather than to a flawed analysis .
in other words the court does not fault blm for providing a faulty analysis of cumulative impacts or impacts to groundwater it largely faults blm for failing to provide any analysis.
maybe the court is right and maybe the court is wrong but the court is clearly consistent in saying that the requisite analysis did not occur .
in a more serious note although you never know whoever wins just ends the game as fighting for second place is not the most exciting thing on earth and you might as well just play another game since games are fairly quick

it may not be possible to see you but supporting you while you 'detach ' from your therapist and perhaps signpost you to a cheritable service or something else local would be my way of working .
comunity mental health groups are often funded and can provide such a valuable psychological support while you wait for fingers crossed funding for one-to-one therapy .
at least you have this space filled with really supportive people a lot of whom have experienced similar and know what you are experiencing .

at least now i have something to look forward to as i support stayhome .

can only share knowledge on the autophagy portion as that is what i 'm interested in as well .
my understanding is that autophagy is optimized at 3 days fast or longer .
dr. peter attia has been experimenting for fasting for primarily autophagy benefits and he does water only .
he 's been doing this for a couple of years and recently switched from a 7 day to a 3 day fast .
he does n't know the biomarkers that indicate that autophagy is maximized however he is tracking it and has access to do that .
valter longo has created the fasting-mimicking diet where they can supplement but still trick the body it 's fasting .
i do n't believe anyone knows when autophagy is triggered .
i 'm on a water-only fast because maybe it 's not just calories that trigger it off but chemical/organic molecule/micronutrient imbalances or balances ? .
supplementation would affect that and as such steer it from autophagy .
of course perhaps the opposite is true no calories but some micronutrients might facilitate autophagy to take place while a lack of it might cause more extreme starvation .
this study from valter longo shows that this happens for other repair mechanisms https valterlongo.com/the-fasting-mimicking-diet-as-opposed-to-the-more-traditional-water-fasting-results-in-a-decrease-in-intestinal-diseases-in-mice-and-in-systemic-inflammation-in-humans
did n't someone on reddit make the new intro or am i confusing that with something else ?
using a lower sensitivity and a bigger mouse pad to use your arm/shoulder for movement instead of the wrist can also give your wrist a break .
that a vertical mouse really helped when i developed a repetitive strain injury while doing qa work
also if you 're experiencing frequent pain do n't neglect it .
rsi pain develops after you 've already done some damage and from i 've read read some people have a difficult time managing it after ignoring it too long
how utterly generous of the us government after they genocided them to steal their land and resources..
if you look at the motherboard you 'll see a coin cell battery .
just remove it and place it back after about five minutes .
what this does is that it resets the bios settings .
all i know is that the last smoke i had was 10 pm last night and it 's 7:30 pm now and i 'm about to bite my face off and kill something but i will be strong and keep that pack at arms distance and a week from now will be able to breathe again .

did i make you angy pants by insulting your millionaire internet friend ?
how do you tall to each other in game ?
as a low level myself it 's surprising how quick you can buy many different businesses if your wise with your money .
do n't buy a card right now for a game that has n't been released especially if there is a new line is going to launch before said game will release .
next gen professional cards will be announced on the 14th and we should know pretty quickly if the arch is hpc only or if it has a gaming variant .
that said 4c/4t is now likely your absolute minimum req for most games .
6700 2080ti and it 's fine for 4k but even that is starting to have some odd issues with under optimized modern titles chimera squad being a somewhat notable example while doom eternal has no issues whatsoever
with engine which is what you 'd use on auba he has 98 dribbling with 95 agility 91 balance and the rest are 99 .
spark system lots of promo events/celebrations with daily gatcha currency+free daily rolls or roullete suptix dream summon costumes freebies etc .
they only do n't give free 10roll tickets every new game version or new event like in dl but i guess it 's because of spark system players would be able to spark every 4 months if dev give bunch of free 10roll tickets so often
i keep holding out hope he 'll get a seat somewhere anywhere .
did he say that 's what he was protesting ?
where is the other protesters then that he is counter protesting ?
just because people are protesting two different things does n't make them counter protests .
this man is protesting the reopening he never says he 's protesting against the protesters who are against reopening .
if we have a men 's rights protest and then a while later have a female rights protest does that make it a counter protest ?
https en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/counter-protest according to wikipedia a protest and a counter protest happen within proximity to each other .
this man is nowhere near another protester nor does he mention them .
i saw this right after i moved to indy took a picture and it 's now a magnet on my fridge .
honestly sick of them and this is a breath of fresh air
thank you for boosting my confidence in the id .
this first flush has largely dried out before they could grow caps worth harvesting .
but i look forward to making a few meals out of these guys .
the mycelium spread makes it look like i could have way more mushroom than i can eat .
yeah matchmaking on those activities is just a bad idea .
what would be nice as exchange is bungie moderating lfg and making e.g .
a section for beginners or so where people can post lfgs for learning groups and such .
fuck re learning a new system when i 've been playing playstation since ps1 like 18 years ago .
i 'm a controller guy through and through and dont care that there are advantages for shit .
the advantages of either system dont in my opinion alter the dynamic that shit players lose and good players win lol
i got a note posted through my door by someone down the street saying they would support reporting my next door neighbours because they seem to go in out of their house too often in the middle of hte night etc .
i just had something similar happen on sunday with some checks .
the atm just ate it and the transaction was denied .
all i did was call claims and i was on hold for more than an hour but i finally got through and told the the info on my receipt and the amount of the checks .
the way they work is once they 've gotten all the info for the claim they will issue you a credit .
i did have anxiety through the roof until i finally spoke with claims though so i advise you to not panic and just prepare for really long wait times because of covid .
i 've been seeing horror themed islands and those look cool
within extreme circumstances i do n't personally believe freedom should be absolute—this would be different if an individual/group disobeying guidelines only put themselves at risk .
unfortunately those fools claiming to be not scared are putting their neighbors and communities at risk with their choices which is particularly relevant knowing the high percentage of asymptomatic carriers .
all that said i acknowledge that our country simply is n't going to accept stricter regulations and norms like south korea etc .
i wish our government and leaders would be more consistent and urgent with recommendations for safety but we are broken in that sense .
already more lives lost than in the vietnam war—and many more to come according to projections .
they have a lot of cute ideas especially if you look up retro or pinup style photos
except zayt himself does this himself and is someone who is very blatant about bending the rules .
of course he does n't want to implicate himself but it 's cheating and i do n't care if all pros did it
i did stronglifts 5x5 when i started out which deadlifts 1.5x per week and my deadlift went from 5x 100kg to 5x 150kg in 3 months .
not gon na say you should do stronglifts or not cos lots of people do n't like it but you do n't need a deadlift program to quickly progress as a newbie
so many times over the past decade we 've heard the same thing about buccs rebuilding and ready to bust out and every time the same thing happens .
i 'll believe that shit when i see it .
i honestly think journeys end what with new worldgen and other stuff is gon na be a completely different experience
i 'm planning a hike on thursday and was able to confirm that a lot of the trails are open .
my first pick is going to be signal knob with veach gap as a backup .
were you able to find any good info or have any suggestions on hikes ?
if you want something to think about be careful on some of those descending lines .
i know it 's partly the style and splitting you 're attention on playing and singing is difficult .
but when you 're sliding through the vocal line you 're just missing the centre of the note and it 's most noticeable on the way down towards the bottom of your range just a bit sharp .
next time you go through it focus on a couple of those parts without accompanying yourself .
take it a bit slower give yourself a pause on each note til you got it and move on .
to me hearing about her again it was very clear that she is suffering from something .
the fact that people dont give her benefit of the doubt is disappointing .
worst even a minister felt have to express himself .
they do competitions with the spike feeders and people often post 75 budget builds excluding commander cost so you could probably find a good introduction to cedh and then build up from there .
fair warning though vannifar may struggle to keep up in some cedh metas .
naar mijn mening is het handiger om dan alleen de flexible spell metamagic toe te staan als extra voor de sorcerer .
anders veranderen ook een paar abilities waardoor de sorcerer een onnodige boost krijgt .
dat lijkt mij niet terecht naar de andere classes omdat de sorcerer niet mechanisch slecht in elkaar zit .
het gaat mij niet per se om meer spells te krijgen .
het gaat mij niet om extra spells te krijgen of verder enorm gebufft te worden .
i tried not to focus on it this morning i could feel it less definitely getting closer .
considering china server had 20k players in wild legend under the old rank system while i never saw anyone above 500 legend on other servers it 's safe to say their wild playerbase is 20 times the size of americas and europe combined .
what type of if are you planning on doing ?
i worked nights without much issue for about 3 years .
all of a sudden i could n't any more .
i got myself an at the time expensive fitbit with an hr monitor to see my sleep patterns .
i was sleeping 9 hours at a time and getting fewer than 30 minutes of deep sleep per night .
for a 9 hour night the average is between 80-110 minutes .
it suddenly made a ton of sense why i felt like total fucking trash all the time all my joints ached my head constantly hurt i got sick all the time etc .
my body was trying to get into deep sleep to regenerate itself and it could n't .
it took 6 months to get a transfer to day shifts and by the time i did i was having mental meltdowns over the smallest of things and was so desperate not to be alone that i 'd go out partying with friends and then just lie there on their couch pretending to sleep until morning came .
by the end not even sunlight could dispel the depressiveness .
i 've always been a massive loner and very stable mentally .
it was such a shock to me to be going through that as a result of a lack of sleep .
that thing is super sweet ... but it does have a fair bit of rust underneath .
not for the people that bought thousands of shares before the reverse split lol your brain is in the toilet
he hurts my mom and i physically and emotionally .
he also has to know everything that happens everywhere in the house .
oh did i mention that my stepdad does n't work and bought 3 boats and shit while my mom worked 2-3 jobs ?
also i literally can not talk to him without being crushed emotionally and/or physically .
he does not do drugs or alcohol so i do n't know what the fuck is wrong with him .
my mom wo n't even divorce him and i do n't know why .
this is why i carry knives around because i always feel uneasy and scared .
would you vote for hitler if he ran against donald trump ?
brooks said in an interview they recorded 60-70 songs when they made the album so there 's a lot of unreleased stuff
well sekiro and nioh are japanese games set in japan .
bloodborne however is a japanese game set in the west well a fantastical version of it at least .
so by calling got an american version of bloodborne i 'm saying it 's kind of the bloodborne thing in reverse .

i 'd like to preface this by saying that i 'm an xbox player who bought this game back during dust line .
since then i have played on and off but every time i get into the game the crippling learning curve scares me away again and again .
i know i can be good at this game .
i 've had glimmers of brilliance such as acing against a team in casual and winning a game for my team whole last alive yesterday but i 'm just ... so bad .
yesterday i talked to a high ranking player i think he was platinum and he recommended i work on my aim in terrorist hunt and play hostage and secure area instead of bomb in order to figure the game out better .
he recommended zofia ilia the new girl forgot her name and gridlock .
i played all 3 zofia has always been a favorite of mine and i like them but now i 'm torn should i practice on ops i like or play easier ops until i get better ?
i also really like caviera but i never play her because i feel like i 'm wasting her when i use her .
he rightfully pointed out that i have a reliance on trap operators here and i need to broaden my horizons .
i do n't really like anchoring and i 'm doing terribly on defense .
once again should i practice on ops i like or play easier ops ?
finally the toxicity on this game is insane sometimes .
many of the players will tk you for not posting a kill the first round i 've gotten lots of hate mail from teammates and enemies telling me to kill myself and uninstall and i 'd be lying if i did n't say it was discouraging .

i was able to squeak by with a 776 passing score .
because i know people will ask i took a bootcamp a week before the exam and really did n't do any study outside of what we were given from the bootcamp .
honestly i do n't care too much about the score because a pass is a pass .
but after the nightmare i went through even trying to take the exam i am surprised i passed at all .
i ca n't say for sure if this is a mac-related compatibility issue or something on comptia 's end but here we go
i tested the software before the exam as it suggested several days before my exam .
about 2 hours before my exam i tested everything again i noticed they updated the software and the one i was using was now out of date .
i downloaded the new software and tested it and it seemed to be working .
i closed everything not relevant to the test and clicked the take exam '' on the website closed chrome and launched the software .
for some reason the software kept kicking me back saying i had chrome open .
i looked in my dock and saw it was still open .
i closed it again and confirmed it was closed with the task manager .
it kicked me back 3 more times saying chrome was still open .
someone from customer service had confirmed with me that there was an issue launching the exam .
the exam finally seemed to be launching but then the screen was black and nothing was happening .
i waited freaking out the whole time because literally nothing was happening .
i could n't click chat and i was afraid if i left the screen it would cancel my exam .
my phone rang and someone from customer service was on the line .
i shut it completely down per his instructions i could n't do anything else the software locked me out of my menus and dock and rebooted .
after everything came back up i quit everything again relaunched the onvue software and tried to re-initialize the test .
it kept kicking me back to the desktop saying chrome was open .
i was literally sobbing at this point because i spent 5 hours this morning with crippling anxiety about the exam and my literal worst nightmare was taking place .
i kept checking my task manager and it said now that chrome was open but not responding '' and no matter what i did it would n't close .
it would n't even let me force quit it .
the guy on chat was telling me i would have to re-schedule .
i felt really bad for him honestly i did n't blame him at all but i am a mess trying to get this working .
i tried troubleshooting by opening and closing chrome myself but my computer for some reason would n't open chrome at all and task manager kept showing not responding '' .
i 'm having a literal panic attack at this point .
just as he 's telling me that customer support is working on my case and that they can issue me a voucher/retest the exam suddenly shows the welcome screen .
i 'm not celebrating but i ask him if i can start the exam .
he seemed confused but told me if the exam had loaded to go ahead and take it .
i thanked him a million times and started the exam .
i do n't want to scare any one but wanted to post my personal experience .
i do n't know what happened because after the exam ended it showed that chrome was still open but not responding .
i had to reboot my computer again after the exam .
i was planning on taking net next but i think i 'll wait for the testing centers to re-open .
i would have loved for the at-home thing to work perfectly and become an option for me but after this experience i feel like comptia has some issues to work out on their end it does n't make much sense to me that initially you have to launch the exam from the comptia website which auto-launches the software when you click the begin exam '' and then the software immediately auto-locks you out from your applications .
you literally ca n't close your browser and have the software running at the same time .
i was not in the mindset of taking an exam while doing it so i ca n't believe i pulled it off .
i feel like fh4 did a great job with buying properties but wished you could customize it more .
the description of this sub is we do n't see it a s a left right divide we see it as a top bottom divide. i personally think that biden is better than trump and you may disagree but regardless democrats clearly have a better history of supporting the poor .
republicans on the other hand passed a huge tax cut not to mention that trump is a self serving billionaire himself .
for those of you who blame the dnc for blocking bernie that is true to an extent .
however the real problem was young people not voting not whatever the dnc could have done .
all of this is to say that biden is clearly more in line with the ideology of this sub and bernie supporters .
i was a bernie supporter before he dropped out but now the choice is clear .
nearly any criticism you can think of for biden trump has done worse .
and do n't even get me started on the supreme court .
all we can do now is swallow our pride and vote for the lesser of two evils .
i have had this problem for years and sent them to nintendo to fix them but they could n't do anything .

the sorcerer is a spellcaster that starts with three random low-level spells level 3 or less .
they can not learn from books but get a choice of new spells to learn at certain level points .
their spell power is n't drawn from their intelligence but rather their xl the spellpower of a sorcerer is equal to that of a non-sorcerer character with 10 1/4 the sorcerer 's xl .
the cleric starts with one star of piety and gets to choose their god at the beginning like a warrior character would choose their weapon .
they are specifically limited to elyvilon the shining one lugonu zin qazlal beogh and nemelex xobeh .
clerics start with extra strength and skill in invocations .
druids start out as three star worshippers of fedhas madash .
they also know a random starter spell from one of the elementalist classes .
you are a spirit of nature recently given an independent existence .
you have in yourself a microcosm of the elemental forces that created you .
each three levels the game picks a random one of the four elements .
from this element it picks a random spell which you gain as an ability and use through strength rather than intelligence .
wind 60 an ability which performs a weaker version of airstrike in a beam with a range of two and costs 3 mana 40 an ability which both hastes and levitates you and costs 4 mana
water 60 an ability which allows you to expend a potion to fire a high-damage bolt for 4 mana unless you 're standing in water in which case it only requires mana 40 a water-elemental summoning ability that can only be cast on water squares for 2 mana
earth 80 awaken vines 20 create oklob plant for 6 mana
each element can only be gained once but at level 15 all mana costs are reduced by 1 and at level 18 they all function as if you had three more points of strength than you do
you can not learn spells in the ordinary way nor can you train spellcasting or conjurations .
each elemental ability is related to evocations and its own branch of elemental magic .
high elves have a small chance to permanently lose a point of strength when their health it reduced below 25 but gain exp when they miscast spells .
in addition any damage directly taken from a miscast is halved .
you were born into worship of ru and you have sacrificed all aspects of your race .
even the material of your body has been melted away as you have been gifted a body of energy by ru himself for your incessant sacrifice .
you pick at the start of the game one spell school that you can use .
you can use spells of other schools so long as they have your spell school but you can only train in that one .
you pick two stats each three levels instead of one .
you do not get the extra hand benefit until unarmed level 4 and each level in unarmed after that you can get an additional potential strike however each additional one is less likely .
you can not worship gods but you gain abilities as if you worshiped ru each two levels counting a one star .
you must choose whether you are able to train dodging or stealth at the beginning of the game .
at xl 10 you gain in addition the one that you did not pick .
using a strategy that has a 100 percent success rate in the past for me until now .
invading norway as germany i park my navy with massive air cover 1k naval bombers 1.5k fighters in danish belts and eastern north sea .
not one british ship showing with 87 local intel .
sea zone is showing i have 170 naval superiorty score against britains 33,500 naval superiority score .
practically every british and french ship was in the mid atlantic trying to deal with my other subs .
nothing i 've done has achieved more than 10 percent naval superiority .
it killed 2 of my teammates by accident and an enemy .
i thought ok that was a fluke there 's no way that can happen again '' 30 minutes later i play fuse again and use his equipment once at the beginning of the game .
it kills two teammates and i 'm banned for an hour .
so i had to wait an hour an a half to play and i have to go to bed because of work .

with extra time i 'll probably woodcut or fish or do slayer to get my combat up and pick up more charms .

i got a call from my father that my grandmother is on hospice and only has what they think is a week left tops .
it 's the first person i was really close to that 's going to die .
my gf called me to say it 's not going to work out despite us being together for about a year and a half .
the worst part is having her say i did nothing wrong and that she still cares about me and i am a nice and caring person and have a lot to give .
i live alone in a state with few to no friends away from my family and i 'm not super close with my parents or siblings anyways .
i 've always struggled socially and often so far as to impact me at work .
i 've been depressed before all this for quite a large portion of my life and unhappy with myself as a person .
not that i 'm some miserable person with a horrible life .
i have a nice apartment and job and most people would consider me lucky/successful and want what i have but i wish i could give it up to be a different happier person .
i could go on with more self pity rant but idk everything just sucks now and i do n't know how to feel better at all .
today is probably the first time in years i 've cried .

it was anime film with animation similar too digimon it was a full movie though and the main story is that everything is digitally done but there 's little digital characters and the movie starts as a family reunion i think at the mcs grandmothers house and his cousin teases him for not having a girlfriend then later he hacks into something or maybe something just goes wrong all together but a special online entity is released and i think that characters designed based on a budda or sun god idea and he takes control of everything and then things go wrong across the entire region with wifi outages and electronics bugging out then when the internet entirely makes it so the mcs grandmothers life alert thing malfunctions when she needed it at night he gets sad and then he gets serious with his family supporting him and watching him trying to take down the online entity i think i may have watched it on toonami on adult swim
i gave up online dating because of an ultimatum to myself i said i would be done if i saw one more ad stating 'my children come first . '
did n't take long ... within 5 minutes i was forced to quit for good .
just prior i was so bemused with such widespread cluelessness i took it upon myself to proactively and politely offer some unsolicited advice about not including that .
it did n't go over well at all i was backlashed harshly every time .
and here i thought i 'd be able to usurp all those offspring you suffered for and are biologically inclined to protect .
i 've read a lot of posts in social media from single mothers complaining about how undesirable they feel on the dating scene .
many not only used that opening statement they also included photos with their kids .
why are you posting kid pics on your dating profile ?
are you trying to annoy the virility out of every suitor ?
do n't you care about your child 's safety ?
well you man magnets you got us figured out .
men go crazy for ladies who immediately make it clear any man they date will be one of the least important things in their lives not just sidelined but actively and preemptively shut down .
the way to a man 's heart is making it known he wo n't factor .
i know most of you pine about losing men to other women with fewer or no kids .
if that 's the case why are so many of you acting so high-minded ?
i 'm not saying you should dissolve all pride and settle for any low life that comes along but you need to understand that kids are a lot of baggage someone else has to put up with .
a new man knows he will never be their real father probably never called dad will be caught up in the drama between you and your ex and the kids .
and then there 's the mommy brain syndrome that without you being aware of it brings out mediocre traits that girls without kids just do n't exhibit .
those kids you have are not some new guy 's fault nor are they his problem .
you should do everything you can to mitigate the damaged cause by the bad decision you made with that other guy .
yes i know you love your kids and they are little miracles but seriously if that was n't a bad decision you 'd still be together .
leave your kids out of the subject text and photos in your ad .
if the site asks if you have kids disclose that question honestly but only there .
do n't worry you will have plenty of chances to address this later .
try being your authentic adventurous self the one that shares what she 's like when she 's in love with a man or wants to be .
your life may seem boring with the kids so share what you 'd do with the time you will be setting aside for him !
if you do n't put him first when you are supposed to be enraptured in romance when will you ?
there must be a time when your man is first .
ladies with kids you are beautiful sexy fun and alluring as you want to be .
you might have to adjust your perceptions of what you want and hope .
you can win the dating game if you think about how to offset the disadvantage of having kids .
do n't assume you can date as you did before kids you are n't that person any longer .
this is n't lowering your standards its confronting reality .
hello so miranda is searching for her next island to bring her style with her !
i actually liked this character but i have not been able to search for my illusive kid cat .
anyway i would love for her to go to a great new island !
you can offer what you like but tbh just want her off .
she will be in boxes later today and be able to move to her new island .
the accounts are tied together so if your buddy cuts you off he loses access to your service automatically as well .
obviously certain subscription services would be worth more than others i.e amazon prime has many more attributes than hbo so people on the app would hassle and try to retrieve more than one subscription .
the greatest challenge would be of course making sure that people do n't cheat their way out of not paying their own monthly dues while still riding on their stranger 's services .
any tips for keeping your glasses clean and not having them fog up every time you breathe ?

i was at my lowest last year and at that moment he 's the one who 's there for me and listened .
from that point we 're become closer than ever .
basically we talk about everything support each other be there for each other adore each other and everything 's been great .
we connected and complete each other 's very well and we have a lot of similarities which we are quite surprised ourselves .
this might become my most positive-supporting relationship amongst my previous ones but he 's married .
his marriage is not at its best and it 's been like that for some times .
they had their differences and they had this void between them cus both of them do n't feel like they fill each other 's need/expectation .
told him few times to have a discussion with her .
he did there were a huge fight and ended up to nowhere .
nothing 's change so he said it 's better this way not gon na bring it up living their everyday life provide all their needs and be there for the kids .
but basically they are not having a connection anymore ...
i want to be there for him but again feel like he needs to make things right with his wife .
i have n't really been paying attention to the progression of the album but what is going on with it and is there any news about it or when it might release ?
new to the sub but i have a question !
i was wondering what the general consensus was on impala skates .
i did a search for them on this sub and the posts i see are either pretty good for a first skate at 99 bucks '' or stay away from these demon skates and devil company . ''
i do n't have any skates and have never skated before but am really interested !
my 18th birthday is in a month and i was going to ask my mom for some and though that these would be the best way to go after seeing some reviewers on youtube .

so ark continues to be a pain with xcloud and connecting to the servers .
it worked slightly better this past week only taking a couple attempts to get in but tonight another 30 minutes of trying before i finally got in .
here 's what happens and how i have to keep trying
when it goes to load the 2nd time it 'll stick on attempting to join then give a timeout error there is no error number or anything
sometimes i get in after a couple tries other times it takes over 30 min of trying to get in .
i 've submitted feedback as well and posted here before but all i got was someone asking for a screenshot of the error which gives basically no info so i did and never got another response .
this error happens on console as well if you stop using the app and it remains running in the background and go back and try to log in after not playing for an extended period of time .
this is fixed by force closing the game and starting a fresh session .
closing the game in xcloud does not seem to work the same way unfortunately .
i have a stock dell inspiron 7558 which has a intel graphics card in it .
i installed ubuntu on this machine probably 2 weeks ago and everything was dandy .
tonight i decided i wanted to try out lxqt on it to make it a little bit faster .
so i installed the package set it to default restarted and it appeared to be working .
i logged in and it came up i idlily went down to the workspace switcher thing and clicked on it and the window manager crashed all i could see was the wallpaper .
i waited for a couple minutes and decided it was n't going to work so i hard reset my computer stupid i know i can be impatient then i rebooted it .
immediately after the dell splash it appeared to hang on a black screen .
so i reset it again got the grub menu and tried recovery mode .
tried pushing e and deleting splash and and quiet still did n't work just a black screen .
tried to add nomodeset to the same line and that did n't work either .
i 'm pretty peeved that something this simple could destroy my entire system in such a weird/obfuscated way .
i even tried checking syslog and boot logs with the grub terminal and i could n't even see anything in them from these boots .
my install is probably toast i guess i 'll just install xubuntu tomorrow to keep it lightweight this time and not screw with that kind of stuff in the future .
if any of you guys have anything else i could try i 'd like to hear it otherwise i just came to whine i suppose .
i have a ps4 and read online that the ps3 version of this game was compatible .
i was standing at the window watching for the ups truck that 's how excited i was .
i put it in and find out it ca n't be read .
maybe because it 's the ultimate version with the dlcs i do n't know .
so i went on letgo and bought a ps3 just to play this game .
i use my ps4 controller which works for awhile but then i notice that l2/r2 wo n't work .
i find out online that this happens in just a few games including this one .
so i go buy a controller on letgo but it 's a 3rd party wireless one with a dongle .
the ps3 gets stuck at the connect a controller with the usb cord and press the playstation button '' screen .
i buy another 3rd party controller this time with the cord .
desperate at this point i just buy another ps3 with the oem controller and cord included .
i was looking into animal companions and noticed the ranger could get one through beast master but he has to trade out his action every round of combat for it to attack .
some of my mates think its a bunch of bs but i was wondering for others opinions .
i myself feel like you should only need to use an action or bonus action once at the beginning of combat to order him to attack because after that its just common sense that the animal should know to keep going until the fights over and for him to stop mid combat you have to order him again .
why did they call out each other 's names in the movie when they went swimming after the expedition ?
they sounded so passionate but this is before the fateful midnight encounter .
but today i did all my homework and i think i 'm ready for up coming seminar .
like opara for example and the new maguire card .
maguire is better in almost every aspect except pace so people dash him as unuseable '' .
opara is only seen as a great cb because of his pace .
his defensive stats are good too dont get me wrong and his body type .
opara would have just been seen as another normal cb
i have almost finished cs50 course and while using the ide was comfortable i have decided to set up everything on my computer so after finishing the course i can work on some own projects .
but after spending a couple of hours to get some basics done i still run into errors and issues .
i have ordered a new laptop which will hopefully arrive in 2 weeks .
so until then i would like to learn more about how to properly set up the environment that i am going to work in .
here are just a few things that i ran into
postgresql after spending some time setting it up locally it always gave an error that my password is not correct
python i had an old version of python installed 2.7 and it did not matter that i installed the latest i always ran into problems .
for example pip was always installed into the old directory .
flask installed flask and a couple of other things that i knew i would need but i ca n't start it .
in one case it says the application ca n't even import flask .
in other cases there are 5-10 lines of error .
i am not expecting troubleshooting but rather a few tips on where to start when i want to learn about setting up the environment .
for example a good guide on path environment variables virtual environments etc .
currently i have a very old macbook pro but i will work on linux and/or windows as the new macbook pros were out of my budget .
my friend streams warzone on mixer from his one s along with my other friend on a ps4 .
earlier i used to be able to hear both of them but now i 'm not able to hear my ps4 friend .
both of them say that they have n't changed any settings/hardware but something had to have changed right ?
used to be prolife now i 'm tentatively pro choice i 'm against abortion personally .
i also discourage abortion in general unless you 're raped or your life is in danger .
and if you 're young you really should be using contraceptive .
that being said outlawing abortion is extremely cruel to those that did not want to have a baby but will have their lives ruined because of a baby .
plus i think stem cell research and ivf and plan b is a good thing and if we outlawed abortion we 'd have to outlaw those too by pro-life life begins at conception so anything past this is illegal logic .
i kept thinking that the video was old as i swear i had seen some other rich guy do the exact same thing .
it 's not a huge deal as it 's made out to be if you want drugs you 'll find them .
but if you abstain it 's not like people are going to shove them down your throat .
i would suggest cowell or stevenson if you 're outdoorsy and sporty since those colleges are closest to the recreational facilities and are social i think .
this graph basically shows that confirmed cases are almost entirely a function of testing .
the line for colorado cases is basically a weighted average of the lines for county cases since these numbers are all per capita .
there will be pro sports but there probably wo n't be college
mlb is targeting july 1 and have informed teams to prepare for spring training to resume in june
earns 1 mile per 2 which itself is n't useful but you typically keep the expanded award space access xn and the mpx bonus .
you can transfer miles but it comes with a hefty fee .
it 's sometimes used creepily but it 's not inherently derogatory i believe .
no part of needing to tag '' enemies feels natural or fun !
plus while i do understand some would oppose handing out legendaries so readily as you would inevitably end up with some people who just sit there not helping ...
there 's so much rng involved with even getting anything passable let alone in trying to get anything specific that i 'd much rather the players who are contributing not have to worry about missing chances even if that means some would get away with leeching .
i see that scene in helena in my head whenever i see the meme lol .
spider-man was always my father 's favorite and i saw civil war with him and when peter parker is introduced he elbowed me really hard in the ribs and told me he 's been waiting for that his whole wife .
why not just swap the stator over to one with lights or rather .
i bet that has a stator with a lighting coil on it already .
how many wires and what color are coming out of the stator plug ?
my yx160 came with a lighting coil on it already .
i heard that this happens every couple of kits .
go to adafruit customer support cause that 's just messed up and i know you tried everything at this point .

pay attention to your schedule and order sizes i always try to aim to deliver in the first 15 minutes of the window so i have time to get back to the store for my next window take it slow and get a feel for how long shops are going to take you to complete and deliver .
after a while you should have an idea when you take an order how long it will take you to get to the store shop the order and deliver it .
there is also netorase which is the guy watching his girl get fucked consensually .
it gives you the same vibes as ntr that 's why there is no tag for it in many sites
we really enjoy playing in front of others ... we also enjoy watching others play .
there are some ls clubs where a couple can play while others watch from nearby and possibly through a window .
not trying to be an ass but once your photos are on the internet they 're probably not going to get out any time soon .
but then again there are so many random pages that keep posting pictures of girls that it 's practically impossible to take them down just be careful i guess .
do n't forget to hide your to the moon erection with your three ring binder .
so your original question you might be able to make one scp per ou and attach them to their respective ou to get the ou condition .
but to make the policy seems hard and brittle you 're either making denies or removing the full access scp .
if you use cloud formation the latest stack sets release allows you to attach to an ou and it auto applies to new or moving accounts .
so if you construct your dev role with that it vastly simplified the management for many accounts
we have hundreds of accounts use a combination of tf automation scripts cfn and scp .
i always leave scp as a last resort because it 's harder to inspect need to be in the master account and there 's no good way to make exceptions
nigga me for gl is literally a website so what the fuck
it 's a mathematical term a quantity represented by an arrow with both direction and magnitude . ''

one of my goals is to educate people about moissanite and diamonds so they can make the best informed decision for their engagement ring purchase .
there are democrats and republicans not people who vote based on who is most suitable for running the country .
for too many people they will just vote for whatever candidate their party puts forward even if it 's trump .
i 'm worried that the change to a xc2 art style is gon na affect how the characters come off and result in some tonal dissonance .
like xc2 in english was so bad you basically had to play that game in jp if you wanted to be able to take the characters even remotely seriously whereas xc1 was really good in english .
it already seems like the voices fit these models way less than in the original .
not saying they should have reused the original models because those looked dated af even in hd on dolphin but it would have been nice if they had made new ones that retained the more realistic 3d style of the originals compared to these cel-shaded anime ones .
there are many but the first ones that popped into my mind are okita jack and nero
was doterra on the list of companies recently sent letters by the ftc ?
saying they can be fined if they claim their products can fight illness ?
personally keeping this exemption in place helps to show people how absurd/non evidence-based this ban is .
i do n't think it will but it may depend on what stage in your refi process .
if you 've already done your checks it should n't effect it .
the only difference is the bottle shape the juice inside is the same .
edp will come with an atomizer spray tip the splash will come with a stopper .
pro tip a medicine dropper or glass pipette is a very practical method for splash bottle application .
one or two pipette drops is usually the same amount of juice as one atomizer spray .
oh i am sorry my bad i misread and thought you said you didnt understand .
did you initially go into ocs with any military experience ?
can you speak anything about the reserves side of being an officer ?
i have a bachelors degree and a pretty solid job .
i initially enlisted into the reserves got a 95 on the asvab and got cleared at meps last week .
while at meps the marines liasons basically told me i was silly for not going the officer route .
i was under the impression that i could n't be an officer unless i went active duty so i never contacted an oso .
today i contacted an oso and she said i have a competitive portfolio but i need to improve my fitness .
i can only do 6 pull ups 80 crunches and a 3 mile in 23 minutes right now .
but i just started training this week and i 'm hopeful i can improve .
i 'm on the fence about going to ocs or just saying fuck it and enlisting .
i was wondering if you had any advice for me ?
that 's always what i figured their relationship on stream was for the most part but there seems to be actual beef rn .
idk maybe it 's just the next arc of the arg lol
epic gunna grab one for sure thanks for the follow up !
maybe because you were born in an era where technology was n't as prevalent ?
i bet my ass you would be just as attached to technology as people today are .
now we all got ta wear beards and commit to being evil .
oh no it blew up earlier mods went nuclear started deleting everything .
they made a post which was essentially mocking everyone saying so what ?
then started replying in the post and were quickly called out on the bullshit .
they deleted that and made a second post joking to be directed where they could be paid for removing it .
one mod deleted their reddit account might be two now .
then they stopped allowing new posts and a few hours later it 's private .
whats the deal with people posting screenshots in here thinking people will recognize someone ?
post the video link or the place you got it or dont post at all noone here can find it without the link
it 's based off the myth of narcissus and echo !
if you want the rundown i can pm it to you because i do n't think many people want to see my rambling about greek myths

i 'm moving out because of work opportunity and university in the fall .
there is no end in sight to this crisis especially with people idiotically protesting stay at home orders .
you 're probably right she 'd get used to life in a city .
and i 'm able to pay for anything she needs and my roommates look forward to living with a cat .
i 'm just having a hard time deciding to bring her mostly because of the health risk especially since both my roommates and i will be in and out of the house everyday .
risk vs reward i guess though no reward comes close to risking my cats life
i would love a tchotchke version of this to calm my mind at work

just 26 days ago you posted that you 're a physical therapy student .
but still you do n't know the details about op 's injuries and should n't be giving such advice .
there are many injuries that would be worsened by this behavior .
and as you should surely know there 's different levels of activity that is acceptable based on the timeline of the injury .
not being a jerk just suggesting against giving such broad medical advice on the internet
well if we do end up going back and you ever need someone to show you around let me know ! !

i was in your same position 3 years back !
tbh i cried it all out within 2 days and jusr got on with it .
what actually helped me which i 'd never admit at the time was my brother constantly reminding about the break up .
he felt that by being blunt about it it would help me get better sooner .

my grandfather was a sheriff in new mexico at the turn of the last century .
when he retired the town gave him a glass gun a pistol i think ?
i 'm almost 60 and my mother had me in her late 40 's .
my grandfather was almost 60 when my mother was born my grandmother was considerably younger than he was .
i think there 's a chance for it to get above 2 i really doubt it will get into the 3 or 4 range with the uavs and today 's events kinda obsuring everyones vision .
this had the chance to get to 3 and 4 but i just dont see it .
honestly even if it goes above 2 i hope i catch the rise early enough to be out long before it peaks .
i thought my risk tolerance was high i learned it was not .

if he had just reported her for overstaying her visa nta .
it 's the fact that he was only moved to report her criminal activities once it became useful for him .
he only reported her when he wanted to prevent their child because it 's also her kid not just his that comes across as vindictive .
again if it came out that she overstayed her visa on its own nta .
if he had reported her when he first came to learn her visa expired nta .
waiting to report it and then using it as a tool to get some custody of the child that the two of them had together that 's vindictive and that 's what makes him an asshole .
i 'm not saying she 's innocent but we 're not being asked to judge her criminal activities just the fact that he used that to win a custody battle before trying to pursue it civilly .

my belief is there is an epidemic of bullying because the job market has been so difficult in the u.s. due to outsourcing companies shutting down more candidates applying for fewer available jobs .

nope lysergic acid diethylamide is a serotonergic psychedelic that was synthesised in a lab derived from ergot and marketed as delysid a medicine used for psychiatry and therapy as well as modeling schizophrenia for psychiatric study .

your daughter is in high school so i think you tell her the truth and make sure that she knows if anything weird or uncomfortable happens she can come to you .
since she is n't in school it 's the best time to deal with a negative reaction since she wo n't be seeing the woman for a while .
if there 's any anger or sadness she can cope in the comfort of home with her mom .
the other thing is that you should report this woman to the school or at least flag it as a concern with them if it happens again when schools are open .
she 's being extremely inappropriate by trying to maintain contact with your daughter in my opinion .
i 'm not a parent but the woman my dad had an affair with had kids at my high school and would regularly try to contact myself and my siblings and i wish anybody would have stepped in to stop her .
it definitely ca n't hurt as long as you do it right .
having lived 6 years overseas now where it takes at minimum 3 stops to get the groceries i need for a week or more the big department stores are one of the things i miss most about america .
i go separately to a butcher one part of the city produce vendor can get this more locally fruit vendor home goods local version of a super market .
if i 'm getting fish that week it 's a different area and needs to be done early so saturday morning 6am fish market trips are a thing in my house .
then there 's the stuff that is foreign or specialty that i need to go to a whole different kind of store for or order online when i can find it and plan enough in advance .
grocery shopping day literally takes almost the entire day sometimes multiple days of the week .
in the us i 'd take my list one maybe two hours if i need to do a costco trip and maybe 30 minutes to break things down and pack them away at home .
you mean the thing that everyone with an ounce of sense expected to happen is happening ?

i think there 's evidence there 's a group of rich powerful families controlling the world from behind the spotlight well at least their influence is downplayed and evidence 9/11 was an inside job etc .

i 'll leave the toilet play part to others i 'm sure there 's a lot of great things to do but it 's not my ... cup of tea ?
for longer play i 'd suggest to get the timing right .
leaving her naked for the entire time is charming in theory but eventually it 'll be as sexy as a nudist colony eg not at all .
much better to do the sexual stuff on phases and only have the humiliating parts as a constant thing .
you can still dress her up in fun ways but let 's focus on impracticality and humiliation .
having her hands tied for meals is a good one both in front of and behind her back tying one wrist to the opposite ankle can be fun tying her up for her showers is fun as well .
actually she should always be cleaned by somebody else .
simple reminders are fun such as always having to carry lube or requiring her to stay lubed up for an evening .
i 'd need to know you a little better to get some better ideas
if they are willing to support you have that conversation with them .
it 's not fair that he was taken from you or them but you can make the best of it .
you should see what options you have after that .
as for the money that needs to be a conversation as well .
if you accept and they follow through with support there is no reason they should be taking away your meager means to survive just a little long with everything going on .
if they don't.. then you have to do what is best for you .
if you are determined to make a new life without them there is no reason for you to worry about them being upset you did n't give the last of your money to them that your husband left for you .
sorry but your will be taken down do to having real life stuff in it .
the force says chief scott woods has reviewed the file and additional information — including the video circulating on social media — and directed a service investigation under the alberta police act to look into whether the officers acted appropriately within the scope of their training and lps policies and procedures .
the officers being reprimanded and the cunt who yelled get down on the ground '' constantly fired for sheer incompetence ?
hopefully because that this was handled horribly and completely inappropriate is visible to a naked eye and does n't need further investigation .

there is nothing wrong with the film did this scene it works wonderfully in the context and atmosphere they build up there .
you seem to be more interested in a 1:1 comparison with the books and base most of your ideas around that which is missing the point .
i agree to some extent with what you are saying but you take these little things and overplay them to a degree which is kind of ridiculous by any reasonable standard .
gimli 's comic relief is enough to disqualify it from being a good movie '' well no it clearly does not and basically noone agrees with you .
your ciriticism is n't unique in it 's broad parts but how you apply it is .
yeah i have seen certain parts before i even share them but the conclusions you draw are so radical and mostly based from not looking at the films on their own that it becomes fruitless .
ebert also is n't the sole authority on these things btw i am sure some critics did n't like the films as much but overall they got a ton of critical acclaim .
ofc it is important to realize that these films are blockbusters still applying standards which would make sense for some character study or small arthouse drama would be ridiculous .
there are also genuine emotional moments in these films be it frodo and sam the rohans speech the ending itself faramir 's suicide mission and how it was edited etc .
anyway i doubt we would ever agree on it your priority seems to be completely different mostly book centered

threaded barrels are evil as we all know designed by satan himself and thus make guns into baby nun murdering machines because reasons unless of course the gun was manufactured before an arbitrary date .
because as everyone knows as guns get older they mature and become less likely to jump up out of the safe and start indiscriminately killing aforementioned baby nuns .

i had the same issue when i used to practice shoutcasting most people would enjoy it and a few would hate it best i could do was apologize to those people for being obnoxious and remind them how to mute me .
as long as they 're not brandishing a specific legal term it 's perfectly legal to carry a firearm for any reason you want in most places in the us .
it 's also easy to argue the phrase the people 's right to keep and bear arms shall not infringe '' being the supreme law of the land any laws outlawing carrying firearms is itself illegal .
but even if you do n't believe that carrying firearms is n't illegal an any of the places the protests occurred .
wearing a rifle strapped to your chest with combat gear is arguably brandishing a weapon particularly when there was no actual reason for them to be there other than to scare anyone who might enforce social distance laws .
intimidation or trying to spread fear for political reasons is terrorism .
it might be different if you could prove that the individual in question was infected but that would require due process .
the constitution does not guarantee someone the right to wantonly infect people out of pigheadedness .
i 'd say we have a duty to disobey laws that are immoral or violate our rights or the rights of others .
there is literally no constitutional right that says you cam disobey laws you personally do n't like just because you do n't like them quarantine is not immoral it is ethical to attempt to achieve the best possible set of consequences of any given circumstance .
or are you arguing that nobody should have disobeyed segregation laws and runaway slaves should have been returned to their masters ?
i never said immoral laws should be upheld i said you do n't have the right to disobey a law simply because you do not agree with it .
these people were n't putting on a protest or demonstration and if they were they can do so while following social distancing guidelines though the would n't need their guns to hold a protest against social distancing rules .
no one took their right to free speech away .
the right to petition the government for a redress of their grievances .
no one has taken their right to protest away .
this supposes that you know their inner thoughts and feelings .
even if their intent was to intimidate their intended target was to intimidate the government .
that is not only allowed but the very purpose for which the 2nd amendment was drafted .
the government jailed someone for the act of trying to make some money cutting people 's hair in a free exchange of services for money .
jailed for breaking social distancing laws that would cause the curve to rise not for trying to earn a living .
this virus infects exponentially one person can be responsible for hundreds of infections people who break these laws are playing with other people 's lives not just their own .

which is fantastic however that phrase from other publishers has burned players in the past .
call me skeptical but as their esrb rating which is an enforced label does show in game purchases and they 've not explicitly said that those in game purchases are only for dlc then that leaves a whole range of other things that label could mean .
to be clear i 'd be happy if this skepticism is misplaced and i believe enough that cdpr is n't going go screw over its players that i 've pre-ordered the game .
that said when the game has yet to be released and there is n't explicit evidence that there wont be some shenanigans with purchases i do n't think that sort of caution is misplaced .
meanwhile the real fact is more people have died than did in the korean war .

in general tho you can look at lip vs mana pot best case for lip you keep dpsing and worst case you pull off dpsing and evocate for 2 ticks if you go over or double tap if lock .
mana pot provides static regen lip offers regen as well but you get that 1 extra cast at the very least .
of course in a perfect world you can blast the whole time the tank does awesome on tps/no misses or parries and you get to mana pot for full efficiency but to ever get to that perfect world safely and considerately you got ta have the lip ready .

haha i had that dilemma when selling all of mine it was n't for sampling but ive been wanting to put some.of my jams up on youtube and figured i should include all the volcas before i sell them .
eventually i just gave myself a time limit because it was stressing me out more than doing it for enjoyment .
i was still expecting to do it but they sold on the first day .
i would hazzard a guess that it 'd be pretty easy to get samples of all the volcas off the net .

i 've recently got into a pickle where i am required to pass a hair follicle and urine drug screen and got hit with the news while high on meth was my 2nd time doing it and it was just the worst timing ever bc the one time out of the blue i decide to do it i get hit with hair and urine tests .
me and my girl had to spend 500 dollars for 2 bottles of old style aloe toxin rid shampoo in order to pass the hair follicle test .
we passed we are just waiting to make sure we wo n't be required to do any more drug test but that kinda shit makes me not want to ever do meth again lol .
but you mentioned molly and personally i do love mdma but i feel sooooo much worse after a night of mdma then even 3 days of being up on meth .
with meth i do n't get hit with the terrible depression or hangover as long as i get some sleep .
guess that 's kind of a negative though because it makes it easy to do it all the time compared to mdma where i do n't want to do it but maybe once a year .

an honest discussion in my mind compares the effect of 4 more years of trump to an effective 12 years of biden and is a far more difficult decision than this post makes it out to be

he tried his best to prevent himself from sweating inside the layers of synthetic insulation he wore to protect himself from the biting wind .
he took a look at where he came from his tracks in the snow trailed on until they disappeared behind a ridge in the near distance .
the lone human took off the rucksack on his back and pulled out a map .
he took a moment to pinpoint where he was on the plastic sheet then placed it back inside the rucksack .
he pressed onward taking in the sights of the environment .
although there were no standing trees he noted fallen timber with patches of permafrost underneath where the snow did n't reach .
sitting on a fallen frozen log was a single unfamiliar flower .
its petals shivered in the wind yet it did n't blow away .
thibaud diverted from his course and approached the flower .
upon taking a closer look he saw that it had been frozen to the wood .
the presence of the flower did n't make sense to him .
it looked like permafrost and permafrost takes at least two years to form .
the man took his ice pick and extracted the flower from its perch with as much care as he could .
he managed to break it free from the ice then he placed it inside a small plastic canister in his jacket pocket .
he made a note to investigate the plant when he returned to his lab and he pressed on .
thibaud continued for another hour or so in the snow .
he passed areas that he could see were once rivers and clearings that would have been pastoral .
this land would be more vernal if he can get the terraforming device at the location he had mapped out .
perhaps he would see where the flower had come from .
the thought of the flower sent a chill through his body .
thibaud shook the line of thought from his head as he approached the foot of a peak .
he planned his expedition to rest in this area and searched for shelter .
as if the solar system knew his schedule the planet 's two suns began to set just as he had found a suitable cave .
the explorer took off his pack and sat down .
he did n't bother to take any of his other equipment off but he did make a fire from some flammable materials he had brought along from his lab .
the explorer woke up to the sounds of movement .
when he opened his eyes the first thing he saw was his fire freshly extinguished unmelted snow placed on top of it .
but he was far enough inside the cave to keep away from errant snowfall .
thibaud jumped up and looked outside the cave entrance .
one of the suns had returned shining light on a set of footprints leading out of the cave .
on the ground just outside the mouth of the cave was a bundle of flowers unfrozen and exactly the same colour as the one he had extracted from the log .
he was n't alone and he was being followed .
he did n't know what to make of this .
he had no information that there were other life forms on this planet let alone sentient life forms .
after all they did n't harm him in his sleep .
native species were n't always welcoming according to his research .
he did n't want to find out if he was in danger or not .
his destination was another hour away and he set off at a pace faster than before hoping to make the travel time shorter .
his trek led him to the top of a hill in the centre of a basin .
thibaud felt himself begin to sweat but he ignored it and unslung his rucksack .
he produced a spear-like machine from the bag and stabbed at the hilltop with it .
the frozen surface took a bit of convincing before he finally managed to pierce the ground .
the explorer put all of his strength into burying one end of the machine deeper into the ground .
when he was satisfied that it was secured he pressed a few buttons on its side .
the end of the device exposed in the air bloomed like a flower and whirring noises began to rev up .
thibaud could feel pulses of energy through the air and ground beneath him as it activated .
a meter on the device showed him that the area 's oxygen levels were getting closer to sustainable levels .
he took a few steps back from the machine and within a few moments he observed the snow melting away at a rapid pace from beneath the machine .
to his surprise flowers bloomed almost instantly as the snow receded from the location he had planted the device as if they were waiting for the snow to uncover them .
thibaud drew the canister from his pocket and took a look at the flower inside .
this flower was the same as the ones that were growing on the hill .
his fascination was interrupted by a blow to the back of his head .
thibaud lost consciousness for a brief moment gaining it back as he tumbled down the side of the hill .
dizzy he fumbled about to regain his senses while the snow continued to melt away .
in his blurry vision he could see more of the same flowers a lot more of them were growing at the bottom of the hill .
but under the floral layer was a horrific discovery .
as his vision cleared and the snow melted away .
thibaud could see what could be hundreds of thawing humanoid bodies scattered about the open areas the flowers growing on top as if they were feeding off the corpses .
from the top of the hill he heard a crashing sound .
he looked and saw a hunched four-armed figure on two sinewy legs hammering away at his terraforming device with a rock in a panicked frenzy .
it made some noises in what thibaud assumed was its form of communication .
he did n't need to know what it was saying to see that it was agitated .
the creature smashed the device one last time then bounded down the hill toward thibaud with terrifying speed .
he instinctively ran but the creature managed to pounce on him and pin him to the ground .
as it sat on top of thibaud putting pressure on his chest the creature pointed its equivalent to a human finger towards his face .
while it did so the explorer took a look at his hand where he had somehow managed to hold on to the canister .
it had broken open and pierced his glove and skin drawing blood .
dripping in saccharine malice oh my fucking god please tell me she stole that from the title of a smut romance novel
i 'm eying the imperial edition upgrade but i 'm wondering do i unlock the ability to convert equipment to the imperial style for other characters or do i have to play an imperial/craft the gear to make use of the appearances ?
i wanted to share a way to earn gift cards the legit way .
it 's called fetch rewards in the app store and you basically just scan receipts and it 's really easy to use .
i redeemed 25 amazon gift card today and you can get points and use it to redeem gift cards for xbox playstation walmart target itunes and much more !
when you sign up and use my code 73pkw you get 2,000-5,000points which is 2 5 irl .
you have to scan a receipt right after you use the code to redeem the points !

like many others i 've had a lot of time on my hands in the past month and a half .
and also like many others i 've decided to use this time to learn new skills .
i figured this was a good starting point for me because i had no coding experience whatsoever .
but as i was styling a website my motive suddenly came into question .
i realized that i do n't have a clear motive for learning to code .
i guess it started off with a vague intention to add a technical skill to my resume as i do n't have many hard skills .
and would a potential employer be impressed with a candidate who knows how to do some coding and decide to hire them based on their ability to learn a harder skill ?
i would really appreciate some advice because i would like to know if i 'm investing my time correctly .
looking for a charger available in .au that can charge/store 4 lipo 's at once .
the ones i 've seen are n't available anywhere including ebay except for crazy prices .
alternatively i could buy 3 more imax b6 clones although i 'd need to modify one of my high amp power supplies to be in the correct voltage range ...

so today i wanted to show off my beachfront facilities but doing so properly would take more than 20 pictures so today here 's part one of it .
and sorry for the late posting lost track of time .
my dock has ample storage space as well as a little office space for party management .
a little sleeping spot set up like how lulu had hers .

'about twenty thousand of them my lord ' said the captain .
the captain confused asked 'why the red cape my lord ? '
'so if i get wounded in battle the men will not see me bleed and thus they wont lose hope ' .
the battle was long but in the end the king came out victorious .
the king asked again how many enemy soldiers were advancing to their position .
'over tenthousand strong my lord ' said the captain .
'ah.. well hand me then my brown pants ' said the king
there 's five hours until we get a look at the series x gameplay within inside xbox and i 'm pretty hyped to be seeing the games of the next generation .
admittedly i 'm not expecting much to greatly interest me but the start of the hype cycle for a console is always a great ride to be on .
the new assassin 's creed and cyberpunk 2077 are definitely going to be around but what else could there be to see ?
i 'm not going to make any guesses or predictions for this one as there 's so much that could be likely to appear .
games rumoured such as a new tony hawks pro skater and those that have leaked such as that harry potter rpg .
even completely new ip that make some interesting genre combinations .
whatever we see large and small will for sure impress .
as for star wars month it ended with some more relating to the jedi knight series with my experiences of outcast and academy http home.darkrulamedia.uk/gaming/a-jedi-knight-seeing-the-light-of-the-saber and my quest to understand the lightsaber combat .
to go with that article there was a new video on jedi academy with a game of capture the flag https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gkqbtzj4n30 against bots .
then on star wars day a new battlefront video went up showing off scarif within instant action https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wlgxkgkspbi .
this marks the last content update for the game as it 's all hands on deck for the new battlefield for those at dice .
those who have worked on the game for these past two and a half years have brought the game to greatness despite the bugginess of it within places .
had the team been larger there would have been a lot more content we could have gotten .
there has been so much missed potential but hopefully the team at dice can once again work on a star wars game and bring everything they have learnt with the second to the third battlefront to make it the best it can be .
with the clock ticking until the new inside xbox starts i 'll be waiting and hoping for some great surprises some fantastic showings of what this coming generation can do and for at least one game to impress me enough that it gets added to my what i 'm waiting for list .
is there a difference if i spend the time to dig a moat and fill it with spikes or just deploy the spikes ?
i have several cree bulbs that work flawlessly with wink and alexa via wink .
i 'd like to move them over to my my echo show which claims to work with these bulbs without any other hub .
i am having no luck with alexa discovering them even a brand new one never set up on wink .
tower of god episode 6 was quite intresting to say the least i felt like this episode was mainly focused on anaak .
we got a bit more info about her past which was really interesting and her fight scene just gave me goosebumps .
and i love how they introduced these new classes or ranks '' .
it kinda reminds me of some mmo games i 'm really excited to see how will they develop this in the future .
but on scene that stood out to me is when rachel had a vision of bam and his friends leaving her maybe foreshadowing that one day bam will forget about her .
i know when you apply for the cash card you 're required to give personal info .
i also know that the cash card is distributed by sutton bank and i 've heard the name lincoln bank too .
so does cashapp open up a bank account in my name when i apply for the cash card ?
i just wanted to make a quick post about what i believe it will be like as i had a bit of an epiphany as i was scrolling through this subreddit i realised .
this is based off of a dnd thing right ?
so maybe for multiplayer it would be some sort of pseudo dnd type thing with large co-op missions that would be able to be played through with a group of friends whilst i realise this may not be the case i just felt it necessary to point out the source material was a pen and paper rpg so if they made it this way it would make some sense .
i 'd like to hear others thoughts on this and if i 'm missing something that makes me sound like a massive idiot lol
i am an infp and i 've heard that infp personality types are often diagnosed with bpd .
as we all know anything but plain old fashioned heterosexuality was quite a taboo in the older days say pre-stonewall for sake of limiting that to a time and that carried over to the pictures back then and even nowadays that might be controversial .
due to many social norms and restrictions there was barely any way to shed an outspoken homo or bisexual character in a good or let alone neutral light .
so some filmmakers and/or actors have bent and subtly outlined those norms to imply other kinds of sexuality of their characters .
the two roommates '' from rope 1948 are a famous example of this t.e .
lawrence in lawrence of arabia 1962 vienna in johnny guitar 1954 and captain renault in casablanca 1942 have some pointers towards that direction .
clever hollywood figures have always found ways to form subtle implications to respect the code while also winking the other way .
are there any subtle examples of implied sexuality pre-1970s you can think of and how or why they implied that in use of the character .
thinking 1 being absolutely useless and 10 being ground breaking .
i do not claim to have any special connection to allah .
i 've begged allah swt to be gentle with me .
i 've read countless hadith in my life and plenty of parables .
one thing you never ever want to do is to ask allah to increase you in punishment and trials .
i have made this mistake once and swore by his holy name that i felt perfect in emaan .
i wish i could remember this particular sahih hadith from our beloved rasool saws but it goes along the lines of the mercy of allah is as infinite as a believer makes it out to be and one should never seek out trials from your lord .
seek forgiveness seek gentleness and always think of your lord as merciful .
recently some particular quranic verses struck by my heart in my sleep .
subhan allah this easily could 've been a nightmare or something extremely scary .
but i 've literally begged with tears to allah to be gentle with me and to treat me like a lost child weird i know but the idea is he our lord and not a vengeful biblical god and we should n't seek him as angry but as a loving watcher and master .
i urge you all to make this dua to allah too it 'll change your life .
this dream absolutely tore my guilty soul apart but has given me a sense of peace along with gentle warning .
i ca n't explain the eerie sense of calm .
say o my servants who have transgressed against themselves by sinning do not despair of the mercy of allah .
indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful. qur'an 39:53
my mother once taught me of a name i would implore you all to remember .

although i am not banned on tgese subreddits i ca n't post on them .
i have a title a subreddit and a picture i want to post but post button stays grey .
the only reason i actually made an account to comment here was because of this building .
it is a seemingly abandoned building listed at the address above near the evergreen state college campus .
we have looked up the address and nothing comes up about the building except for the address itself .
no records of the building exist all records that we did find are about the houses next door to the building .
last summer me and my friend found seemingly bloody clothes behind the place .
admittedly we should have called the police but because we are dumb teenagers we did n't for some reason .
whenever me and my friends visit this place we all get some seriously strange vibes like someone is watching us or following us .
i do n't know if this is some sort of placebo effect but it 's such a weird off feeling that i ca n't help but be extremely curious about this place .
my friend 's older brother also broke in through a drain entrance that leads to the basement and told us the place was extremely decrepit and strange on the inside .
if you can get back to me about what it is that 'd be really cool !

i told my partner the story of how starálfur hit me like a truck when i lost my grandfather back in 2014 and then started to play it .
within the first 30 seconds our unborn child decided it was time to start dancing for us .
quite possibly the most surreal experience i 've ever had .
like i said initially this is probably going to be some meaningless information for most but i needed to express myself somehow and thought some of you might enjoy the fact that sigur rós can bring joy to even unborn childen !
does anyone know where i can find custom roms for it ?
i 'm finding that i have about 10-15 imports for files .

i installed a new cooler i think the paste went bad a corsair h60120mm liquid cooler to lower the temps and i can play longer then i could with the older cooler .
i was able to play doom eternal for a couple hours today before a freeze .
games like star wars battle front 2 freeze after 1 match .
so i was finally able the recreate the freeze that i am getting during games using prime 95 .
my cpu temps were way to high and i received a windows notification i wouldnt notice in a game saying my core temps are to high caution .
i was able to create this freeze stressing the cpu only 3 times and a fourth time doing a cpu gpu stress where the temps were higher on the cpu then the other freezes .
while i game i dont drop frames and am able to play at 144fps .
highest i noticed was 80 during read dead 2 .
i have also ran memtest for 10+hours and found no errors .
i moved to a country where finding good flour is hard i did find however some overpriced gluten powder is some specialty baking shop .
by adding a small teaspoon of the gluten powder i can make really nice elastic dough that is perfect for italian breads pizza just about everything .
this video put me on to a very powerful shampoo thats been giving me good results .
glad theres people like this on the internet tell others what has helped them clear up this troublesome condition .
obviously theres a a couple different kinds of folliculitis but i just started using truseb 2 weeks ago and im already seeing a drastic improvement on my scalp .
after i shower with the shampoo and leave it in for 15mins i put pure tea trea oil and tolnoftate antifungal cream on my bumps .
caution avoid eye contact as chlorphexidine can cause eye damage wear goggles or eye protection

had anyone seen a battery case that is discolored like this .
i have n't even started azteca yet but words can not describe how much i love this ending .
we finally get to put malistaire our first and greatest enemy to the eternal rest he desired .
we thought we had gotten rid of him in dragonspyre but despite seeming to go to the other side with sylvia his will to defeat you and the power of shadow overthrew his love for his wife once again .
it was a shock for many players fighting him in xibalba where he falls through the ground and plummets into the spiral imagine fighting exalted malistaire back at level 80 or 90 something without shadow spells where we know it would n't be the last time we saw him hopefully the same case goes for morganthe .
of course once we hit level 100 we get a challenge from malistaire for one final match .
despite the pettiness of still trying to get others to kill you for him even though he said it would be an undisturbed duel between the two of you it was still a journey worth going on to find him .
he can finally use his full power against you but as always underestimates how much you too have grown in power including in shadow magic like him .
after his third defeat he finally realizes it he ca n't win .
every time he thinks he has grown stronger he does n't realize you have also grown stronger .
he knows he 's hurting people with his own selfish desires putting people in pain by trying to continuously achieve the impossible including his wife .
finally her words make him realize this and he knows he must finally just try and spend the rest of eternity with sylvia in the afterlife in peace .
the best part is that line we will not meet again . ''
he 's come back from defeat twice but he 's finally given up .
you have succeeded in quenching the bloodthirst in his heart and put him to rest for the last time .
sure the ending cutscene is a bit ironic and loses weight once you farm him 23896546 times for gear but it 's still an emotional moment the first time .
your goal of saving the spiral is n't over yet but at least you could finally put your oldest rival to rest after giving him one last hoo-rah and let him be with his wife .
i 'm personally glad malistaire is gone for good but i expect some people to be maybe a bit disappointed we can no longer keep annihilating him lol .
hey at least he went out better than morganthe .
i 'm just starting out on lexapro after learning that nearly everyone in my family is on it their dosages range from 10mg to 30mg .
i myself have only briefly dipped my toes into the water with some wellbutrin that i discontinued using after a while .
personally lexapro is something that i 'd like to try for the long haul if i find that it works rather than just taking it for a year or two .
is it easier to deal with the side-effects at lower dosages ?
do people who do n't have a history of major major depression end up coming off it at higher dosages ?
i recently built my new pc and everything seemed to be working fine but it 's recently started acting a bit slower on startup and when running games .

when i downloaded gta from steam and tried to go into online in said that i have an altered version of the game so i logged into story mode and out of curiosity i pressed f8 and menyoo popped up .

in the u.s. and have only been ever able to get general products mainly use general mint dry portions and mini mint .
just placed my first order for some non-general snus .
got some skruf fresh mint to satisfy my mint cravings and some catch eucalyptus to try a more 'different ' snus .
catch eucalyptus seemed interesting and herbal notes like that piqued my interest.. browsing around i also saw skruf mynt seems discontinued ?
which included actual mint leaf in the portions and flavors like jakobsonns cola .
what are your favorite 'unusual ' snus 's that you would reccomend ?
every time the ring closes you and your teammates gain possession of a loot item depending on what you hold or what you need .

you are able to choose which type of box you want but the items inside are random .
you and your team also will not take any form of damage for twenty second with a 3 meter radius .
enemies in this radius will also take on the same burning effect you take from thermites .

i think doing something new will always be uncomfortable .
i do n't think there is a way to completely mitigate that feeling before starting .
if you really want to start you perhaps unfortunately will need to commit to feeling a little awkward at first .
the good news is if you do get into it your skills will grow naturally .
when i started i tried to hide in the back of the room .
over the years though i 've done performances competitions and battles which i never thought possible .
if you are in a school setting that is a great place to look into classes and programs .
every scene i have been to always welcomes new people .
if you have a friend to take with you that can help .
even if you go alone to a class i suspect they will be extremely welcoming and a lot partner dance classes like latin will rotate you through partners to practice with anyways .
it may just feel awkward but if you commit to it you will grow over time .

when the pt came out a lot of older fans disliked them because of how drastically different they were .
not in a 'we want a rehash ' kind of way but more because the very shiny flashy cgi world just did not feel like star wars to them .
i know that the shiny flashy world is intentional and makes sense because it 's the height of the republic but that does n't change the fact that people did n't like it .
the movies also felt lacking in personality and emotion especially when compared to the ot .
this was largely down to lucas ' poor directing and dialogue .
for years the consensus was that the prequels were at least not very good movies or even terrible movies .
i remember when i was growing up most people i knew disliked them as well as most people online .
this has drastically changed in recent years and i think its for 2 reasons
people have learned to appreciate things the prequels have that the sequels do not .
the prequels have original ideas and creativity world-building and a good overarching story .
the sequels story is all over the place at times and mostly just borrows from old movies .
2 younger fans who have grown up entirely knowing the prequels are now having a voice on the internet .
many of these fans never knew a time where only the original trilogy existed so they ca n't really understand why people were so toxic towards the pt at first .
many things that to younger fans are just part of star wars now were received badly by the previous generation .
whilst this younger generation is entering the fandom the older fans who are more hostile to the pt are leaving .
many of them are getting old and do n't really care as much anymore .
some are likely just bored of complaining about them online or have been driven away from star wars entirely .
alternatively many other older fans have just made peace with the prequels and accepted them for what they are despite their flaws .

you can also try and put it into the factory reset mode and there might be settings in that menu .
stereotypically they also eat a lot of fish which i assume includes other stuff than fatty salmon as well .
maybe they 're just at 22.7 or something and finland/sweden/denmark are 22.3 or whatever .
it does n't have to be a big difference .
also im not sure what you mean by the cable running alongside could you elaborate ?
i was in such a hurry to complain that i tripped on my lips
it 's basically the same as it is sports climbing without the harness because you have the pool underneath you .
that said i still upvote it as it is such an unique way of presenting climbing competitions as most people is n't aware of even if they know about climbing .
i mean ... did you leave a game and not go back to it ?
i 've had a game where it just did n't let me go back into it and i gained 1 abandonment and an elo loss .
imo it 'll be the same as it is now .
gives me a chance to see if i like it not as if i 've got much to do at the moment lockdown lol
my wife and i have friends that moved around the same time as us .
we both were making quite a bit off the sale of our first homes since we both bought in 2011 when the house market was still down .
but they pulled 30,000 out of the value of their home to do renovations that were n't truly necessary and went from 20 equity in their new home to 10 bare minimum allowed by the bank and forced to pay 175/month in pmi plus financing 280k .
we rolled 115k into our new mortgage and financed 217k no pmi and qualified for a much lower rate .
are there things we want to do to the house ?
bathrooms need remodeling kitchen needed remodeling the list goes on .
i 'll remodel when i have the cash saved for it .
all of that was the difference between our 1517 mortgage and their 2150 mortgage for houses of the same size and value .
when we talked about the renovations they asked how much cash we have on hand since we mentioned my financing it which they effectively did by pulling value out of their house and we told them and they were blown away at how we were able to have 50k in cash .
but this is also the same couple blown away at how we have 280k saved for retirement already at 31 when they have less than 10k .
of course i come here and read about people retiring with 2mil at 31 and feel inadequate ha !
but unfortunately it comes into play with the cousins hate .
to not mention it and deny it would be kidding ourselves .
it 's pretty obvious based on the landscape of today 's crazy world .
saw a side of them i never wanted to see .
the characters in rent are now dead within 7 weeks .

there is definitely a non-zero number of colonists who had slavery as their top priority but i do n't think it 's fair to say what anyone is thinking .
communication was so slow and unreliable everything is gossip and 100x more inaccurate than today .
it works for me after a reboot but i 'm sure there is a better solution
if birth unit ever tried that with me in addition to using me as her punching bag i would have replied get bent ! ''
i am actually stunned how marvel sold so little .
it 's being sold for 20€ along with daemon x here
the example is not quite correct since it does n't show the graphic settings used .
so it may be just an attempt to call denuvo bad '' with false info .
people have done much more extensive testing and from what i recall it depends what cpu you are using .
this is a version of origins that has removed denuvo and i think it was 2 years later not just bypassed as is the norm and as far as i know is the only game that crackers ever managed to achieve it .
the results were more into the conclusion that the difference in fps can only be felt with cpus that are 4c/4t or older .
i just wanted to say that i had to read the comments to work out what the question was .
this is one of the most bizarre things i have ever heard of !
reading is an activity that goes on in my own little head .
it has never occurred to me nor have i ever seen anyone being insecure '' about their reading habits .
the comments here are reinforcing my opinion that facebook and goodreads are a waste of time and i am very glad that i do not participate in either !

i know people on bicycles who do more per day than i do when i 'm in my car .
but the thing is they have been rotting in a shoe box for about 2 and a half weeks .
i do n't have anyone i 'm close to so it 'd be dishonest to say anyone loves me .
apart from the violence which is a really big problem and the biggest reason why i personally hate visiting rio or são paulo because they 're really bad on crime in general brazil is actually pretty cool and believe it or not car accidents are n't really that bad in brazil .
however tbf it probably has to do with the facts that
1 roads are awful almost everywhere so you ca n't really go crazy fast and
2 there are low speed limits and road cameras everywhere that 'll fine you on hundreds of dollars for going above the speed limit .
so yeah i guess my point is that maybe it 's not so bad ?
he 's 100 legit purchased pdm fragrances from him last week
yeah well call me old fashioned but i personally believe that 11.4 people per year killed by guns in a school is too many but you guys just luv ya gunz .
taking schools out of the equation your nations obsessions with being allowed to own guns purely because some old scripture says you can is astonishing .
at what point will you finally fill your quota of preventable deaths ?

the arc reactor used in that fight was the shitty one made in the cave so it had already powered something big for some of its 15 minutes and it was sitting in the counter producing light so it was giving off energy then too
i 'm so mad right now omg the nerve .
i will reimburse you for the cost and the postage and send you a goodie box filled with disguises .

having more than 60 fps means that your monitor can display the latest most up to date frames .
i feel like you 're just trying to prove my points at this point .
i do n't love my mother but she never loved me .
i do n't know what love is in the absence of empathy .
she never really bonded to me or felt empathy for other people in general .
it would be best if we just never saw each other again and so far so good for four years .
do you have people in your life you love ?
if you have the capacity to love and feel and have closes friends that 's what 's matters .
you only owe your mother whatever you decide you owe her
as a non-religious person i often see religious people either completely disregarding this as a hoax mainly because their religious beliefs are tied to their political affiliation .
yikes i ca n't even imagine living in that state of being .
they mix crazy unfounded conspiracy theories in with their religious beliefs to come up with stuff that is n't even remotely true just so that it all makes sense in their head .
yeah there probably have been and still are a whole bunch of asymptomatic/unconfirmed cases because of our lacklustre testing .
she went to take a shower it had been 30 minutes ... 1 hour .
i called for her and she did n't respond so i assumed she was just taking a long shower and could n't hear me .
at the two hour mark i knocked on the door and no reply .
i got really worried that she may have hurt herself .
i found a pin and file and busted open the door .
makes you wonder how other teams are passing these tests when they do n't have a main character who can use talk-no-jutsu .
too add more probably just shitty story boarding and writing ?
from chapter 2/3 i had issues with the writing .
owner willingly sells off mom and separates her from her 3 children to the person who killed the husband .
suddenly owner has a change of heart and decides to not sell off daughters after the son got sent to prison ?
only explanation is the owner wanted to diddle the sisters himself .
even prison when the king let everyone of his soldiers die to test the kid ?
the king then thanked the kid for protecting his people and then obliterated his people with magic .
i still like it but someone has to slap the shit out of the author so he starts making some fucking sense .
in terms of semi-grotesque imagery that lasts for more than a few seconds i ca n't think of anything outside of something with a unique style that might creep some children out like courage the cowardly dog .
though there have been plenty of inappropriate or dark themes in other children 's content .
disney especially in their older days with the drunk scene in dumbo or the children being transformed and enslaved in pinocchio .
also while i 've never seen it i 've heard rocko 's modern life had tons of adult storylines and that show was aimed at kids as well as college students .
and let 's not even go into family-friendly '' sitcoms .
i was able to activate and use the pod .
ca n't tell you why the pod is n't communicating i think there is no switch or control on it to disable the pod after releasing the cannula protection .
i work at a company that has some level of vertical integration .
we save the scraps and send them back to be reground and made back into more base material for our products though after it goes through a certain process involving heat the material is altered in a way that we ca n't reuse it .
we sell those scraps to another industry that the material is fine for .
but we 're still burning through reams and reams of paper a day printing out orders that could and should be computerized .
we even compact our cardboard and send it out for recycling for whatever that 's worth but not a single bin in sight for paper .
you can see how tight that formation is when the warthog on the left has to aileron roll to avoid wings .
brie larson is pretty crap and also her character i do n't like captain marvel at all even in the animated series she is so shit and crappy .
but with that the story however captain marvel provides some of the very interesting story out there even tho i hate her without that character you 'll be missing some very crucial storyline .
yeah and i also love that you get to see the world beyond narnia .
another reason i really like voyage of the dawn treader .
also what a dope name for a boat the dawn treader .
the magician 's nephew is probably a close second for me of my favorites in that series .
i missed all the allegory and metaphors from christianity though .
i was raised an atheist and just enjoyed the good stories so i feel like i 've missed a whole dimension of the series .
you 're wrong and if you think you 're right you should educate yourself so you know you 're wrong
thank you so much id like to share but since were in quarantine me and my boyfriend havent seen each other for more than 2 months or so and to top it off he is also depressed and it has been worsening over the quarantine since he has so many time to himself .
we 've always been a happy couple and we never fight but for the past few weeks the distance physically and him emotionally detaching himself gets really difficult and question myself if its worth it because i would like to at least feel like it is worth it .
then i realized a stagnant or monotonous relationship wouldnt really be fun or at least grow as much if we didnt get to know each other more .
so thank you for this nobody really asked for my opinion on this but i had to let this out 3333
i wish i could time travel and swap places with people .
i 'd go back to 2008 swap places with glock and ram lewis into a wall to give massa the title .
waco siege was when the atf tried to raid a religous community in a huge ass compound in waco .
cause suspicion of child exploitation sexual abuse possession of illegal firearms
a firefight broke out between the feds the branch davidians .
unable to make any progress or breach the building the atf had to comply with a ceasefire .
fbi took over sieged the davidians for over 60 days .
a week before the final raid david koresh offered to surrender if he could finish writing his manuscript for 1 week .
negotiations continued but the fbi wanted a raid bcuz it 'd weaken the fbi 's image if they just accepted a surrender .
raid was basically pumping cs tear gas into the compound with the help of tanks engineers .
the davidians refused to evacuate a fire broke out from the flammable tear gas .
so all the 80 men women children that refused to leave died from the burning sensation of tear gas or the literal burning sensation of tear gas .
they gave jurickson profar a better 5 star than manny machado last week lol

i do n't know if you watch parks and rec but your comment made me think of that one episode where ron swanson would n't let a little girl join his scout group because it was for boys only .
so leslie makes another scout group called the pawnee goddesses that did way more fun things than ron 's group yet when a little boy asked if he could switch groups and be a pawnee goddess instead leslie told him the group was for girls only .
luckily the girls called her out for perpetuating the very thing she was initially fighting against the groups all started mingling and everyone was happy .
it 's late i 'm tired i 'm rambling but you had a great comment and i wanted you to know it remind me of a great episode of a great show haha .

using an arris router that i 'm assuming we got from wow but may be an older modem my wife brought with her from texas .

i 've been running the game with bots on both my wired gaming desktop computer as well as my wife 's gaming laptop that is using our wi-fi signal .

i 've updated the wi-fi beacons because one originally was n't working but that did n't do anything .

i think you are purposefully understandimg my statement wrong ...
look if the pet picks up every currency even the lowtier shit nobody picks up then its at a point where it is practicly generating currency for you .
so you just dont clear every map faster than others you even pick up shit you would never touch to safe time its generating more currency for an individual .
the inflation will also hit pretty hard bots who farm 24/7 currency will zoom throught maps even faster and more efficient with more currency .
they would abuse that thing on a whole different level .
also who the fuck cares if people have more currency ?
stuff gets a bit more expensive and thats it .
while the marketprices will increase for everyone but only a relative small amount of players will have said pickpet and even those would be no matches for the currency bots who will enjoy a heavy upgrade in their farming routine .
the prices would absolutely skyrocket in a ratio where alot of players will experience heavy disadvantages .
and as long as ggg is n't actually increasing drop rates it does n't change anything .
as i said an individual will have more currency in the end because you as an individual wont pick up certain currency items this transitions into the market shit gets more expensive .
currency bots will greatly benefit from it and those are typically the entities that hurt the market you will just give them more power by being able to farm way more maps in their 24/7 farm routine .
the faded sections are just the bed being higher making the extrusion thin enough to see through and the dark is lower so it is opaque .

it 's the kind of job you can get on perfectly well not knowing any but i think it makes a difference .
for example it definitely helps knowing why a particular bearing should have 2-8 tenths interference rather than just to stop it falling off .
knowing a bit of theory about pipework can point you in the right direction to finding failures and the like .
the theory we do is a bit different from the canadian system no idea about the american way .
we essentially do a year of an engineering degree from what i 've seen the canadian theory seems a lot more directly related to the job .

this meant that i had a rep of knowing everything about anything among my peers so one day my friend came crashing in
hey u/baneken is 't true that girls have 3 holes down tere ? ''
well ummm yes because i 'll show you on the book here ... ''
no no i do n't want that is there a 3 holes or not ? ''
thanks man '' and he rushed back out i still wonder 30 years later what was all that about .

to all the other responses to this comment the thread seems to be about guardian weapons that are analogous to specific enemy weapons not just weapons inspired by the enemy races .
my wife often cums while giving me head too .

this is why even with piv orgasms they always feel as though it starts in your head and travels down your spine .
you can drag them to the place in your inventory that represent the money you are carrying outside of bags .
there is a limit you can carry outside of bags so anything else will remain in a bag .
paying a loan at the abd depositing money at the abd and shopping at the various stores will use the money from the bags you are carrying .
i know that girls then put it on their instagram and snapchat story 's
in that case nothing is sexually alluring with that logic .
breast arent sexual objects but they are 100 sexually alluring .
i promise you im not just talking out of my ass here .
the entirree point of human female breasts being large at all times is to attract a mate because it shows that they are sexually mature .
it has nothing to do with milk storage it has nothing to do with survival tactics and it has nothing to do with helping their young in any way .
human female breasts are very exposed and in front of you so it would make sense for it to be a way of indicating sexual maturity .
unlike for example dogs or cats or something along that line where their breasts are on there hidden stomach 's so theres no reason for them to be an indication of sexual maturity which is why they only grow when they get pregnant .

oh trust me the renderdragon engine has greatly improved the capabilities for bedrock shaders .

again they 're all just in testing but like i said the potential for much better shaders is much closer for bedrock .
got ranked iron 1 because i lost 4 out of the 5 placement games .
2 of them had leavers and just plagued by people who do n't know what they 're doing .
im currently bronze 3 but played against 3 golds and still top fragged .
the blueprints are usually hidden in dungeons and caves .
they are way better than the stuff you find on corpses and in regular chests .
there are 5 different types each one caters to different playstyle .
and try to make as much gold as possible makes the game a tad bit easier .
gems and gem dust are pretty easy to come by in dungeons .
runes and glyphs sell for a really great price sell those extra ones .
also exchange any unusable currency you get you will be surprised on how much it 's worth .
city merchants usually have better prices than village or wandering merchants .
there are some unique merchants who will give you the best price in the whole game .
sandisk cruzer force 16gb usb 2.0 is what i got .

so for an average person it takes like a few hours to become a true veteran if they start with mga ?
the first dozen or so chapters are pretty good so for like an hour you think its the shit .
but in the same day you will also know its complete shit .
now mga was my second novel i tried after btth being my first and i couldnt stand it already after the first ruin/tomb .
it was worse at that point than btth after the mc entered the central plains about 1000 chapters in .
all the signs for it being complete trash is shown already in the first 100 chapters so cant fathom how people keep up with it .
dont know if those who took longer to realise it is shit are less experienced readers over all and just havent seen much good writing in their life and dont know there is better out there much better .
like btth turns really bad in the second half but the first half is quite alright even without hyped new genre goggles '' .
not a master piece or anything but its an interesting new world and the mc isnt a total shit head from the beginning worse than most young masters you encounter in the genre so you can at least give it a chance and see where it takes you .
in mga the mc becomes a bully in record time and only reason i can see why people like it is if they feel powerless in real life and use it as a sort of self insert and want to feel how it is to go from nobody to a person with power to abuse .
i dont mind powerful or even cold mcs but i at least want there to be some good qualities to a character i am reading about .
i can even like arrogant characters if they have earned the right to be it as long as they arent always being an ass .
mga mc is the person i want to see killed and humiliated in every novel i read
i guess ill be using either one and not both right ?
preferably the ascendancy i suppose because its on hit .
apparently engels sent a letter to marx in 1869 mocking rival socialist jean baptista von schweitzer refused to defend him when he was arrested for homosexuality and mocked him over it in private .
however a number of people https joanofmark.blogspot.com/2012/01/marx-engels-schweitzer-and-false.html ? m=1 call this into question https www.quora.com/was-karl-marx-homophobic however a number of other people https www.quora.com/did-marx-and-engels-have-anything-to-say-about-homosexuality defend the claim including wikipedia which has other non-web sources .
it 's very true that both marx and engels did not discuss homosexuality very much if at all in public however if you believe in the claims made then they criticised it a lot in private engels apparently compared it to ancient greek pederasty and engels was more disapproving of it than marx .
overall i do n't know enough to come up with a conclusive answer especially considering it 's hard to take quora activists bloggers with much more than a pinch of salt especially considering a lot of the defendants on this case are rather staunch socialists or even communists and scouring wikipedia for sources you ca n't access is n't exactly the best pastime .
there 's heavy debate on it and i 'd rather let you explore the topic and try and give a definitive answer other than the fact that marx did not seem to care much about it and engels was more vocal on his views about it whatever they may be .
better than me or any of my friends can do hands down .

i had an epiphany of appreciating and accepting vulnerability .
it is like after we finally accept that we are flawed and vulnerable we can then grow and become better people .
and i get bogged down with feeling guilty and inadequate .
but i realised that being human this is bound to happen .
once i accepted that this is part of me it is easier to change and focus on growth .
previously i was focused on being angry at myself for being lazy for thinking i am not worthy enough for feeling inadequate .
how do you deal with vulnerability fears and inadequacy ?
i 'm not using the world inadequate '' because i believe we are all adequate in our own ways .
i do n't understand this part of the finale .
the quinns have always been about self-preservation of their own line .
the mom loves forty and coddles him unlike her cold bitchy treatment of love .
why would mrs. quinn or her husband pay to have the cops kill forty in order to protect love ?
joe is a nobody with no family fortunes of his own and was just merely love 's love interest .
this scene and joe 's narration about its justification in the finale made no sense to me .
it honestly took me out in an otherwise solid season .

measures 84 through 87 for me are frustratingly simple and maddeningly out of my grasp .

so the boss my party is chasing kidnapped a good npc friend of the party .
hes been torturing her for weeks trying to find the prison of the real big boss to release him .
party doesnt know that just that he took their friend .
so they chased him to the abyss and at the end of the last session walked in the front door of his hell prison .
i need to make a fun 5 room dungeon that ends with a long satisfying difficult boss fight .
part of the 5 room dungeon will include the escape from hell which will i think be pretty tough .
they didnt plan for a way out just tortured an imp for a way in .
i could really use some legendary actions lair actions maybe some room interaction for bonuses or minuses maybe even things that happen after a few rounds or when the boss hits hp percentages .
they have been tracking this guy down for like 5 or 6 sessions so i want this to be a legit experience for them .
obviously there is a lot of factors to this but just an estimation .
a couple of weeks ago my left knee started to hurt during and after runs .
like a light twinge which always got more and more hurtful because i was an idiot and did n't properly pause .
after it got too bad i stopped running for a couple of weeks .
he told me that my left leg is shorter than my right leg and that insoles should fix it .
he also told me my shoes do n't fit to being an overpronator is that how you say when your feet tend to go inwardly when running ?
well i bought this shoe https truemotion.run/en https truemotion.run/en .
i got hyped in the shop because the seller told me even though i am an overpronator this shoe works so different that it 's totally fine .
well yesterday i did my very first and extreme careful run after the break and with the new insoles in the shoes .
and after only about 2 km my knee started to slightly hurt again .
this time i immediately stopped but still i am a bit hopeless and unsure how to proceed .
i know that your suggestions can not replace the sports physician .
still especially regarding shoes and injuries i hoped that some of you might have some experiences .
background marathon training for october did about 40-50 km weekly between 5/min and 6/min before the injury .

so i 'm going to be getting a leopard gecko soon and i want to have live plants in the tank with him .
i plan on using eco earth for the substrate and i know all you really need for your gecko is a heating pad but if i want live plants will i need one a uv light for the tank ?
or can i put it in a room with lots of natural light and that 'll do the trick ?
if i need one what 's the best one for leopard geckos ?
also i know with eco earth you need to mist it once or twice a week but if you have plants in it do you need to mist it more often ?

and while it 's very fun to level up and try new classes it 's still a pain to catch up with the legendary cloak .
5-6 weeks of grinding dailies and spamming horrific visions until we reach level 15 and even start to catch up ?
i think that 's way to much and a huge turn off when thinking about creating new characters .
let us get a upgraded cloak right after the intro quest so we can start playing mythic plus and raids .
i read these a lot back when i was a pre-teen but at one point i just stopped for some reason may have been that i was banned from the library who 's to say and now i 'm back in it baby !
when i heard the books where available for free download i just had to get them .
the plan is to go through all of the books including the ones i already read just to refresh my memory of the lore but i feel like i can remember how they went pretty well .
every here and there just scrolling through the reddit i see a word or a remark back to a particular event in the books and/or the overall lore that i 'd forgotten but as soon as i 'm reminded it all comes flooding back .
the first book i read was the attack '' purely because i thought it had the coolest cover the one with the tiger and then i was like okay cool !
probably should have read from the first book but good thing they had that exposition intro in there otherwise i would have been completely lost . ''
then i started back at the beginning and impatiently waited for ax to show up .
anyone else out there who started reading them based on which had the most appealing cover to them ?
i bought a couple of massage balls lately and i was wondering it 'd anyone has tried using them on there chest between the ribs with any success .

i 've bought multiple mice since i got my pc deathadder wired g-pro and a mm710 to just name a few .
i always find myself coming back to the logitech g403 because i love the shape and size just not the weight .
i just recently ordered a glorious model d off amazon but had to send it back because the side buttons were busted i liked the shape but it was a tiny bit smaller then the g403 .
i have been looking at the glorious model d g-wolves skoll and xtrfy m4 to name a few .
what mouse weighing around 70g or less would be the closest to a g403 in size and shape ?
should i just order another model d or would there be a better option for what i 'm looking for ?

i was able to use it with the first versions of windows 10 and still no problems .
at some point there was an win update and the tablet stopped to function .
i 've tried to roll back the windows built versions but it did n't work as it used to .
finally i had to reformat the computer re-installed everything and now the tablet is working but keep making jitters .
it takes 2-3 times of removing and approaching the pen from the screen for it to work .
i 've tried contacting the company but never got an answer from them .
is anyone able to provide some type of solution ?

and they have to put them into what they believe is the correct order .
they usually discuss these in groups and they have to be able to justify why they put them in that specific order .
you give them 10 minutes to discuss while you go around and check in with the groups .
at the end you review the correct order with them and you can make it competitive if you want .
the kids have always enjoyed this activity and this could easily be adapted to any grade and to an online set-up with a little creativity like a shared doc or google hangouts .
of course you would explain how this activity would look in a face-to-face setting .

i lived in mira mesa 11 years or so ago and the couple times i went there it seemed pretty sparse .
i have been eating spicy food since i was a kid .
never once got the hiccups until one day after living in this land of very little spice for a few years and only getting properly spicy things if i made them at home .
i ate some fresh hot sauce my friend from trinidad made lots of scorpion peppers .
my tolerance obviously was down but i took a little teaspoon full to try anyway it was delicious but i immediately started hiccuping i was so thrown off guard and utterly confused my body betrayed me in a funny way .
let 's just say the next morning was n't such a pleasant experience either .
weirdly i 've had that sauce many times since and never that bad of a reaction .
there not the easiest to find but i 've been to places where they served pop tarts one at time in a pop tart package .

with laurel road they quoted me 1.62 plus 1m libor .
so it did n't really matter when i refinanced .
the rate only changes once a month but libor changes every business day .
the best fixed rate i was getting offered was 5.10 .
the variable rate i picked has always been much less than that .
and now it 's looking like it will soon be below 2 .
yes my loan could raise to as much as 9 per the contract but i 've already paid off half my balance .
so the risk of a rising rate is not a major concern for me .
i 've been focusing on paying off my car loan since it is a higher rate .
once i pay that off i 'm going to throw more money at my variable private loan .

i 'd love to restore them is your guy at golf gargage able to do that with heavily used clubs ?

sometimes you just work well with someone else sure but then you become reliant on them .

that means that you may develop some gaping holes in your gameplay from a lack of needing to fix them .
man i do n't normally like digging into nit-picky details but this is just one more example of the lack of attention to detail that made the show great .

here 's another question how accurate are most 3d printers to print out such minis ?
could you make the nozzle the width of a hair ?
my best friend at the time hit me in the head with a golf club .
everything has been business as usual except with a mask on .
i have n't had a shipper/receiver without a restroom yet aside from the one or two that didnt have one before all this .
the only place that has taken my temp was a thermo king before setting up my new inverter .
yeah of course it 's not literally haha islam go boom in the game overwatch but when he yells allahu akbar as he 's using an explosive ability in game he 's deliberately evoking the common and harmful stereotype of muslims as terrorists which is pretty fucking racist/islamophobic
it was a kids tv show back in the day .
i emailed my chair first actually funny enough and she told me to file a grade appeal officially .
me and my boyfriend just got into an arguement about this because he thinks it 's unnecessary and it sounds like i 'm schmoozing up and complaining to the higher ups to get this grade .
he 's saying that its her class and if i failed her standards i failed her standards basically and that no one will care or take my side so it 's a waste of time
i hope this encourages people to join their ranks tbh .
i can ping the server_ip but ca n't connect to 5000 port .
op check out r/pettyrevenge if you 're feeling inspired .
people like these need a taste of their own medicine .
now i have no clue how xbox gamesharing works but if there is a primary account thing for xbox then that is prob your problem .
it could be something else but for playstation you have to make the new account you got your primary though settings .

this is probably a little off-topic but i would ask how committed you are to 5e as a system ?
i have n't soloed 5e very much but i have played quite a bit with my regular group and i tend to agree with those who say that 5e combat is n't that great .
fights often feel like a grind of attrition where opposing sides whale on each other until one side 's hitpoints/spell slots give out .
if you 're playing a melee character strategic decision making is usually limited to find most dangerous opponent keep attacking until it goes down proceed to next target . ''
if you 're playing a spell-caster you have a few more options but still not a lot .
add that to the book-keeping of managing a large fight it 's no wonder its sometimes not fun .
have you considered adapting your 5e material to another system ?
from what i remember the solo adventurer 's toolbox could pretty easily be adapted to any fantasy game .

depends on the region northern germans tend to be really direct and honest southern germans are more friendly and try to sugarcoat it .
i 'm guessing most business people rather deal with southern germans .

i 'm not holding my breath for any elden ring news at xbox events .
according to the summer game fest website june is for ea/cyberpunk/steam and july is only showing first party games .
if elden ring was going to show up at an xbox event today would have been the day .
i think it will probably show up at some other event this summer gamescom at the very latest .
i would like to point out that white slaves are also a historical thing .
as in that slavery was commonplace everywhere before 1833 when the british abolished it .
slave actually originates from slavic since many of the slaves in europe were slavs .
not to mention that serfdom was n't a huge leap from slavery for a lot of people think people in charlemagne 's time could vote ?
slavery has sadly enough been part of almost all cultures before the age of enlightenment made us realize infringing of an individual 's liberty was wrong except for prisons and conscription i guess .
claiming slavery as a black only historical thing is simply not accurate .
and i in no way want to downplay the horrible and so very recent past of black slavery in the us but it 's very us focussed to take offense at the idea of 'white slaves ' .
this is why i only buy movies on there if they cost somewhere around 5 to 8 .
it 's only a few bucks more than renting it would cost .
and if i like it then good for me i 'll get to watch it whenever i want .
hi i have a f r fully grown frost dragon in interested but can i switch the fly and ride potions for another legends ?
this thread is chok full of great suggestions thank you !
i think they 'd try to build it next league they 're already pretty done with this league .

i found one of him in my bits box so i 'm adding him to the ranks .

tbh the way romney said that i immediately picture romney in his office having one pile of binders that say good candidates i actually want to pick '' and another pile of binders labeled women in case i need to pick a token woman for something '' .

you know what happened actually i forgot the step about installing the drivers via device manager .

just so we 're clear the glynn county da who the dad worked for recused herself without taking action .
the state ag then reassigned the case to the da in the district over who like a jackass did not recuse himself despite having a family member in the glynn county da 's office and offered an opinion unsupported by case law on why he believed the murderers were innocent .
after the family protested his involvement the case was moved to the da who has it now who has thankfully pressed charges. this is wrong the gbi sought a warrant independent of the da after pressure from the governor .

i did n't say white identity does n't exist .
i said it 's not central to any politics .
if someone was pushing their farm bonafides over and over yeah that would be identity politics .
note how little traction he actually got and the little he did get is because the other guy was identity politics 101 .
if convalescent plasma therapy works is n't that a pretty good indicator that the antibodies generated during infection will work to fight off a subsequent exposure ?

i do n't know how i 'm getting any water in the house when the two red levers have been switched off for months .
i do n't know what that giant cylinder is and there 's no identifying information i can find besides marlo.
i do n't understand any of this and i 'm close to losing my mind so i 'm desperately hoping that someone can point me in the right direction on any of this in case it 's not obvious it 's my first time in a house i 'm renting so any significant changes are out of the question
also my water softener does n't seem to be doing anything but i care less about that than fixing the leak getting non-sulfuric bathing water again
i dont get why people want awakening then eza at the same time .

went to france for xmas my mum had the worst flu she ever had .
i would n't be surprised if she had it .
for me drowning darkness is the easiest but if you do n't have tevarius it is much harder .
the other one i do n't have much trouble with is elaina 's rift the one with cursed xenon and estia .
i used a rainbow team for the first 3 stages then a mono dark for xenon estia and elainas nuke at the end .
because using an emoji of a face sticking his tongue out and his eyes closed totally makes you look like a mature smart person .
you have the ability to speak the most expressive of all the languages on earth .
you have access to the wildest and most diverse vocabulary and you can convey many nuances and emotion in your writing yet you are going to limit your self to this 😜 ?
you are going to limit yourself to using the most shallow and generic form of communication used only by those who who are too stupid or immature to speak actual english ?
then you 're going to wonder why people do n't take you seriously ?
i actually did get that far and thought it was ましてや but they seem to have the same meaning .
now i do n't know if it 's a mistake on the person who made that article of if those two are usually used interchangeably .
sure as long as you concede that they are n't even close to eachother in terms of overall quality lmao
can i like add you in the chat ? ?
i actually do think amazon will probably start getting p700,1000,1200 's if volume stays like this .
which at that point i would think they would go towards usps and fedex drivers and tell them if they had a better rate or could match would they be a part of em .
which then i would think same as you we would be fucked .
i can definitely see the team being undermanned soon more of us with more load .
soon having to join other companies to be stable and have a good job and somewhat same pay as well .
really makes you think how much longer before we 're on the same boat as usps .
will we cave into walmart to survive or will we go to amazon .
and now they 're trying to work something out with my boss to see if we would take majority of their boxes .
not sure if anyone has done 400 stops but if i do i 'll definitely post that lol
bisexual people drug users it was not just gay people .
although when one could develop into full blown aids depended on a persons immune system .
the long end of the spectrum that aids could hide in the system before full blown developed was 10 years so the early 90s was a tsunami of people dying .
so that a senator would be raping in this time frame .
that tara shared the story with people when most would have kept silent to not be thought does she have aids ?
that people she knew then are stepping forward now .
it brings tears to my eyes because of the courage .
malarkey 's face when he heard about the line for the second run says it all .
they got a passing reference in the orderlies part .
honestly i 'm surprised how fast it shipped since other things i ordered in april took 3 weeks .

there 's an apocryphal story that the french meme epee team one year almost forfeited a team bout because the on deck fencer and the alternate were taking a smoke break .
people are having mixed experiences with the playstore stage 1a version i guess ... it is problematic for some and runs just fine for others .
i myself personally had no problems with that like you mentioned and it has always run smoothly .
and i have n't even done any specific step like disabling google play etc .
so i really wo n't be able to guess what might the problem be in your case but it definitely might not be a universal one like the problems in the case of stage 1b version..that one really sucks..and for everyone i bet .
maybe the problem you had at a particular time might have been server/region specific as was the case initially for some people here but as far as i know that was mostly early on when ce edition was being rolled out .
hopefully you may find a fix somewhere else in the subreddit or from someone who have had similar problem and fixed that somehow .
why not drop a mail to vg support itself ?

the character grew on me after reading the manga which—although it follows a separate plot line from the anime—fleshes out his backstory a bit more .

and you 're on the highway ca n't stop to smack the mf ...
the only purpose those bastards have is to be well bloodsucking assholes .
you 're just ignore clear examples where the match or segment was n't bad
lol apparently you decide if matches and segments is good .
apparently if other people think they are shit they are wrong '' you 're so full of yourself you think your opinions on pro wrestling is right or wrong .
it 's all subjective there is no right or wrong .
i hope to not be rude but it is n't the best reason to do that ...
people including me only ships them since a lot of og fans grew up with naruto .
the mistake in this reasoning is that boruto '' is not naruto part 3 it does n't have to treat the so-called og fans '' with anything since it focuses mostly on the newer characters for newer fans and the old ones revolve indeed around the new generation for the 99 of the time .
we all knew if sasuke was a girl then fuck every ship its all about narusasu .
this is just a stupidly wrong assumption ehhh narusasu was the most possible deal but bigotry anti-gay said no ! ! ! ! ''
the fact that there is a sketch featuring hinata with naruto on the background and wearing an uzumaki necklace and said sketch is older than the manga itself ... and kishimoto himself stated that he planned naruhina from the very start and another thing in favour of this is the fact that sasuke was not in his very first drafts unlike hinata an assistant convinced him to create a rival ...
theres lots of more reasons but it leads back to this main reason i mentioned .
then said reasons are not the best ones because if they lead back to a symbolism that is outside of the characters in question it means that it actually treats the characters as interchangeable functions not their own characters .

of course i am not trying to guilt trip or blame you .
i was looking forward to another fruit basket crossover there are not enough .
even classic skins in mortal kombat komplete edition did n't had their mask .
that 's the reason why they take education seriously there .
the first set of authors are fairly known and popular with the possible exception of gardner .
you ca n't go wrong with any of them pick one pratchett or adams are probably the easiest starting points and you 'll be almost guaranteed to enjoy them .
the rest of the suggestions are either a bit more obscure sir thomas the hesitatant the gurkha and the lord of tuesday but still great fun reads and deserve to be more popular or they are books that may not exactly fit the humour '' category but they are still funny and worthwhile books to check out spellsinger jonathon strange and mr norrel .
and the malazan comment is because malazan is a series that fits any recommendation .
and i genuinely believe the tehol and bugg a duo in the malazan series are the funniest characters ever .
and it has other hilarious characters also kruppe iskaral pust ... .
but it 's most definitely not a funny '' series .
it 's dark and complex and sooooo long and definitely not for newbies to fantasy .
but recommending it is a bit of a meme here .
i read the amazing maurice and his educated rodents which is also by him a couple of months back and it was fantastic and if you 're a younger reader that makes a great introduction to his style also .

creating an error is not the same as explicitly acknowledging it .
it took just over 3 months between chapter 2 and chapter 7 coming out .
it 's completely possible and looking at everything else rather obvious that they wrote chapter 2 wrote all the other chapters then wrote what they remembered of how chapter 2 ended in order to start chapter 7 .
it 's not impossible that the artists either themselves forgot what they drew or shocking plot twist are different artists for the different chapters which can happen when there 's 6 of them so the error would n't register for them either .
or karkat bringing up his act of moraillegance with gamz which obviously did n't happen .
it 's not actually all that obviously to the point where a lot of people completely forgot that it should n't have happened anymore when reading .
the shoosh-pap scene is iconic and the scene where they point out that it did n't actually happen post-retcon does n't exist actually it 's only something you have to infer .
the writers easily could have forgotten about that which makes sense when you consider how bad the writing is .
there 's no such thing as griefing though that 's kind of the whole thing y'know ... with pirates and all .

i do n't know what jerks decided to downvote you .
i wo n't be able to take advantage of whatever you make because i 'm about to delete reddit but i do have one idea .
you could make a site with a database of how consistent hand traps see play in what formats .
this could help predict what hand traps will be used in certain formats and thus dictates the playability of certain decks .
something i 've noticed from a recent binge on old and rogue strategies is that lots of those decks ca n't play because certain hand traps obliterate them .
but right now nibiru is n't as effective due to adamancipator being resilient and it does n't do anything in eldlich so decks that lose outright to nibiru have a better chance at rogue success .
on the other hand dark ruler no more is highly used right now which cancels other decks out .
you can kinda do this with yugioh top deck but that 's more broad .
the site could also be used to predict what hand traps to use when .

you 've dehumanized the opposite sides of the ‘conflict ' by comparing them to hitler etc .

when jesus sacrificed himself he did it for everyone basically god sacrificed himself to forgive everyone 's sins including our past present and future sin so long as we ask and accept jesus .
it 's like turning on cheat mode in a video game not we dont have to sacrifice things animals because jesus already did .
basically god decided to stop being a douchebag see anything in the old testament for reference for eve eating a goddamned literally hehe fruit and hacked up some convoluted plan to kill part of himself to forgive us our sins that he 's been super harshly punishing people for since the beginning of the human race .
i 'll make it a more open question then has johnny ever even been implied to have gone after an underage girl ?
i have looked through civicminded321 's posting history and found 1 n-words of which 1 were hard-rs .
i 'm gon na hit you i mean it !
so i get the measurements and then put them in and then put how many hz ?
yeah i do n't think it needs to be below 35hz
i saw the trailer and just assumed it was will smith playing will smith with some needless aggro racial stuff thrown in .
that being said gemini man was legitimately good and sold me back on him as an actor .
if the cat has rabies you start to develop rabies like symptoms and do absolutely nothing to get medical attention this disease is easily curable then after several weeks theoretically yes .
when a friend of mine told me about his bipolar issues and i went hey i do that but i dont have it at least i do n't think i do . ''
country is doing right now is protection their economy .
that 's why we hate outsiders because yall treated us like shit once you decided to live here
around the same age is ideal i prefer them to be 1-3 years younger i 'm 36 but really age is n't much of a factor if we have good physical chemistry and a strong mental connection .
if younger they have to be old enough to be a true adult financially independent and not still asking their parents help for everything and if older they have to feel young enough that i do n't feel like i 'm dating an aunt or uncle .
so it 's not really an age and more a mindset .
i 've had people in their 40s feel '' younger than me and people in their 20s feel '' older .
i see super trying to be the bren 's player of the week .
my birthday is on tuesday and i 'm scared that the people i care about dearly will forget or wo n't care to wish me a happy birthday .
at this point i should probably prepare for it because people do n't care .
if you do n't like the video in 2 minutes your family will be killed .
so start hitting that like button ! ! ! !
tried many different cables and even different fans still the same .
i also used to have them plugged separately into the gpu as there are 2 4-pin headers but it still did n't work .
not really but the more i think about this idea the less i know what it would look like .
imagine mixing the focuses from hoi4 with eu4 ideas and missions and it would be something like that

would it be worth it to buy games on the quest store or use virtual desktop to play it on my pc ?
also if i buy a game on the quest store for example beat saber will i be able to play it on the rift store ?
once i did the blue match-4 double crit all but one cascaded so it did n't turn out too bad .
i used to like abbey sharp and watch her videos a lot but recently i 'm starting to think she 's a hypocrite ?
she 's very judgmental when reviewing peoples ' what i eat in a day videos for example she 's pretty accusatory and implies that people have eds/disordered eating patterns a lot yet in her own wieiad videos there is n't a single junk food in sight .
i know she 's battled orthorexia in the past and from her social media/videos i suspect that she may still be holding onto that and projecting her insecurities around food onto other people .

pudge is leaving today and i 'm looking for him to go to a good home .
really looking for a ironwood dresser diy or star fragments .
willing to take nmts or bells if that 's all people have .
a few of you helped me out earlier in thinking about how to fairly use a screener questionnaire .
i would love to get your insights on a question about duration .
some guidance i read elsewhere suggested i should set the duration field for the hit to be generously long so people can complete the task in case they get interrupted or need a bathroom break or something like that .
let 's say the structure of my survey is that i 've got about a 4-minute screener that if passed segues directly to about a 20 minute survey .
so i 've set my duration at 60 minutes .
the rate of pay is xx for the 4-minute screener with a bonus of about 5x that for the full survey .
but now my survey shows as xx for a survey with duration 60 minutes which is too low .
the title of the survey flags it as a brief screener taking about 4 minutes .
in your opinion is the title sufficient to draw people in despite the overly long duration ?
the full description survey link instructions click to expand i think describes the two-part payment schedule .
i 'm just worried people wo n't even get that far .
i think both shows are fantastic and are both great parts for the avatar-verse and for whatever is next for it .
but why do people hate on the legend of korra ?
i 'm not saying it 's better than avatar the last airbender but i am saying it 's a great addition to the avatar universe .
hell korra could even be argued as more important than aang .
she stopped amon from stealing other peoples bending all across the world if he kept going .
kept the world from darkness for 10,000 years she brought back the air nation from almost complete extinction with the help of tenzin and jinora .
and my god this show had some of my favorite antagonist in tv show/movie history .
zaheer made me wondered if he was right all along even after book 3 .
and amon before we knew who he really was made me really think too .
imagine being a non bender in a world with benders .
i 'm glade they addressed this in the show .
however one thing i can complain about the show was they did n't address it much later on .
amon did take it way to far but he had so many followers because he had great points .
i wish they made book 2 more about how korra would make it better for the non-benders of republic city .
team avatar in the legend of korra was n't the best either .
they were likable characters in just not as interesting .
mako and bolin lost there parents but other than that not to much .
asami was pretty good in book 1 but after that she was sort of just there .
the ones i probably liked the most were tenzin and lin and you could argue they were never a part of team avatar .
all 4 bad guys made her change so much as a character .
hey i 'm looking to buy a gaming pc and i 'm looking for recommendations .
for pve playing with your friends that are on pc/xbox/stadia/ps4 would be amazing .
pvp could have an opt-out of cross play function to make sure you dont get stomped buy some random with mouse and keyboard .
with more and more games becoming cross-platform and sony and microsoft are allowing more and more cross platform play should bungie make the leap aswell ?

is the national park service price gouging visitors to yosemite national park by charging 35 per vehicle ?
there are long traffic jams into the entrance of yosemite .
since they last for hours i estimate the amount of traffic to be several times that compared to a community college 30,000 cars which is 100,000 cars daily .
over a year they 'll earn 1.278375 billion dollars .
there 's no way maintenance and staff costs of the park are anywhere near that .
according to math this is why 35 is extortionate .
so they seem to be profiting over a billion dollars annually .
does it go straight into the pockets of the park management ?
i 'm making a german cream cheese buttercream and i 've never worked with an actual vanilla bean lol .
i 'm planning on steeping the vanilla bean in the milk for 24 hours so after it reaches a boil do i keep it out or put it in the fridge ?
the recipes i 've read just mention turning the stove off and steeping for as long as possible but the idea of milk being out for that long is off putting unless it 's okay to ?
i do n't like being forced to use weapons that i do n't like but i do it for the daily mission credits .

i do thank codm for creating two game mode options to do the gold rush event .
if it was just br i would have written that event off entirely .

today i hit legend https prnt.sc/sdfz34 with a deck many people might think is just a meme tempo priest .
now the only list you can find on hsreplay is actually bad i can confirm .
my list however has been refined and has performed !
although i do n't use a stat tracker or anything i can promise you that i hit legend this season at over a 70 win rate .
i lost 3 games to dh in total on my climb to legend while playing against them in over 33 of my games .
this deck is so good against dh that when i queued into one i could hardly contain my excitement .
below is a picture of the deck and the deck code .
the deck is simple enough to play just curve out and buff your stuff .
while very good versus dh the deck can struggle against mage and rogue .
the trick to beating mage is to push quickly once they make it to later turns you have no hope .
beating rogue is really more on their draw than yours flick is insanely powerful versus this deck but with an injured tolvir into psychopomp opener you may be able to get enough early pressure to win .
the hard carry of the deck is of course sethekk veilweaver .
when mulliganing this card is a keep 100 of the time .
the only other cards i would 100 keep are any of the 3 one-drops holy smite and 1 power word shield .
if you have imprisoned humonculus on 1 you should keep dragonmaw overseer otherwise that card is never a keep .
if you have the coin i 've found it is often correct to keep dark prophecy or if you have injured tolvir you keep psychopomp .
anyone who is facing a lot of dh should try this deck out .
i 'm pretty sure it 's even better than egg warrior is in the match up .
if you have any questions about the deck feel free to ask me .
ok y'all i am wanting to completely redesign my island and have some questions about time traveling please do n't yell at me !
i have 300 hours of playing time and i do n't wan na lose everything i have earned by just starting over .

i am trying to use 2 monitors with my laptop using a vga splitter into a vga to dvi adapter intoa docking station .
they both will not detect at the same time .
if both are plugged in only one of them shows but if i unplug the one that is showing the one that was previously not showing will then show .
and vice versa as i 've switched which monitor was plugged into which plus of the splitter around and tested the same thing so there is nothing wrong with the dvi splitter itself .
this also confirms that all cords are plugged in completely as well .
i 've tried unplugging them and shutting down the computer replugging etc .
i 've read and tried every forum i could find and none of the solutions worked for me including disabling the intel display driver and all of my drivers were already updated .
just to be clear my display will not detect a 3rd monitor .
i 've read numerous forums where the 3rd monitor is detected but not displaying that is not my issue .
i have both monitors plugged in correctly but only one at a time will detect in my display settings .
if i unplug one of them it will then immediately detect the other one but not both at the same time .
they both individually detect and display fine no matter which cord of the splitter i plug them into .

i absolutely love the look of the court cards of my bicycle warrior horse deck https bicyclecards.com/product/bicycle-warrior-horse-playing-cards .
but there 's one big problem with this deck however .
the cards have borderless backs with dark colours black and brown going all the way to the edges .
over time with shuffling dark-coloured ink seems to wear off from the edges of the card backs and make its way onto the edges of the card faces .
as a result the faces of the cards have dirty lines and spots all the way along the edges .
it looks like dirt and grime but i 'm positive it 's from the ink of the card backs because the edges of the borderless backs do show signs of going lighter in colour as the ink wears off .
this does n't seem to happen with the black ink but only with the brown ink .
it certainly makes the faces look very ugly and gross .
has anyone else experienced anything like this whether with this particular deck or any other deck ?
the only other deck i 've really noticed this with is the bicycle gold deck https www.buyworthy.com.au/products/gold-elite-playing-cards-luxury-premium-collection-series-edition-deck-brand-new .
this also has borderless backs with a similar dark brown coloured ink on the edges which wears and makes its way onto the faces .
so i wonder if perhaps there 's just a particular dark brown coloured ink this is an issue with in bicycle decks ?
we got a great deal on the place because there 's an completely unfinished basement and i assumed it would be relatively easy to do so myself .

first up i love all you guys and this community has really been a real blessing to find .
anyway i got diagnosed with combined adhd last month and i 've been awaiting tests so i can get medicated .
my job without getting to specific can involve looking after large groups of children .
i think my adhd really helps me with this sort of thing because it allows me to often be pretty silly and eccentric which can really help entertain kids .
my bosses however recon however that i should n't go down the medication route because i might lose my spark '' .
they 're good friends and have my best interests at heart but i do n't know if they actually know what they 're talking about .
just wondering how the medication affects you guys and if it will affect that part of my job ?

i played the first chapter of the remake the first reactor that you bomb and oh my god what a mess .
so basically the english script which follows the english voices is not a translation of the japanese original script but instead an entirely new script which has no resemblance to the original japanese script .
i played with japanese voices and english subtitles and holy hell what a mess .
square has never been this bad at localizing a script in their entire history as a company .
i know enough japanese to understand most of it but not enough to play with japanese voices and japanese text .
but because i know enough japanese to understand what they 're saying i immediately noticed a huge disconnect between the subtitles which follow the english script and not the japanese dialogue being spoken .
basically the english script is its own entire entity that has nothing to do with the original japanese script .
more than 70 of the lines are changed entirely for the english script and for seemingly no reason .
it 's one thing if certain lines ca n't be translated from japanese to english due to lines not making sense when translated that would be fine and good if they just took liberties for lines like those but almost the entirety of the script is essentially adlibbed with no reference to the japanese script .
it 's like they wrote the two scripts separately without comparing them .
the english script feels like they just watched the video and made up on the spot what to say .
because 70 of the entire script is changed i ca n't even enjoy the remake as a game because i know full well that the subtitles are not what they are saying by any means .
for one thing cloud is a fucking asshole in the english script whereas in the japanese script he 's mostly polite to the other characters .
square went as far as changing cloud 's personality with a new script and that 's just bonkers .
one example that stuck out was that cloud said gakkari saseru na which means do n't disappoint me and the english script threw it away and wrote i should have asked for more money. another thing when viewing the trailers when he encounters sephiroth the 3 lines that sephiroth says in japanese are different from the english trailer and the line that comes after is drastically different .
after sephiroth provokes cloud cloud says do n't toy with me in japanese but in english they change it to have him full on shouting you bastard ! it 's absolutely absurd and ruins the tone of the game and the characters .
there 's a lot more i could write but you can see for yourself if you play even 5 minutes of chapter 1 on remake with japanese voices and english subtitles .
i was actually mad by the time i finished chapter 1 because the translation if you can call it that was so poor and it 's turned me off to the game entirely to the point i do n't even want to play it anymore .
now this would n't be a problem if one were to play with english voices because you ca n't hear a difference since the english voices match the english script but for anyone that want to play with japanese voices it 's simply a major disservice to everyone .
the script is literally its own entity and not a translation at all and it makes me so upset .
you can play in english and enjoy that version but it 's not at all accurate to the canon script and that is fucked .
this should not be happening in 2020 which is a time jrpgs should be thriving and perfectly translated .
is there somewhere i can write to square of america to request they add an additional english subtitle track that is an actual translation and not a nonsense script ?
i really need them to fix this because this is absolutely unacceptable .
when your game makes you feel like you 're missing the majority of the dialogue because the subtitles do n't reflect what is spoken you have a fucking broken game .
the game would be at least a 9/10 if they had even a half decent translation but they did n't even try to translate the game and instead just wrote whatever words were in their head at the time .
i really want to submit a ticket to square of america but i do n't know where and how to do it .
i 'm 27f pansexual my first boyfriend 29m abusive relationship ended a year ago .
i fell in love with a pretty woman at work on january she is lesbian 22 we flirted a lot and kissed eventually i confessed my love and tried to take her out to dates but when it got serious she told me she was still in love with her ex a couple of days later they were a thing again .
i had sex with my first boyfriend but it was either borderline rape or rape .
never had sex with a girl but i know it 's something i would want to do if a start a relationship with a girl .
i feel like i do n't know what 's a real healthy relationship .
and now there is this guy 29m l met sometime ago he is bi .
he said that once quarantine is over he would like to take me out on a date i told him about my past experiences he seemed very supportive when it comes to my abusive relationship but when the conversation switched to my experience with girls he was kind of sacarstic .
e.i are you dominant or more submissive when dating girls ?
oh.. sorry what do you think you would be ? ''
then he told me about his sexual encounters with guys and how they are different from straight relationships .
maybe i 'm reading between the lines things that are not there but i 'm not sure what king of red flags i should be looking for .

i have a hp pavilion power 580-023w and i decided to move everything into a new case the cougar mx330 i did this so i could fit my new 2060 .
this ended up with me just replacing almost everything except the motherboard cpu and stock cpu cooler .
the motherboard that is comes with is a odense2-k ipm17-002 i was able to mount everything fine and plug everything in place .
the problem i 'm having is whenever i click to power on everything runs fine the fans are spinning and the rgb is on everything is fine then after a moment has passed it shuts off completely .
i 've tried unplugging and re plugging everything in i 've done the no gpu and one stick of ram and i do n't seem to get what the issue is .
stock psu 330w ordered a new one yet to arrive it 's evga 500w 80 white psu
i 've looked up a lot of reddit posts and looked at software manuels and troubleshooting guides but i seriously do n't know what the issue is .
i think it could be the psu not giving enough power to everything though on the other hand it could be the motherboard being from an ho prebuilt i do n't know if it likes being outside of it 's original housing .

i 'm single and bi and always wanted a threesome .
i met a guy on tinder who indicated in his profile that he 's part of a group of sex friends who have threesomes and moresomes together and we matched .
we 're now fwbs and i 've had a threesome with him and one of the other friends f but we found out we 're particularly compatible so we flirt with girls on tinder or other apps together and also in bars and that has lead to one more threesome and a foursome .
we tried looking for guys but most men who are single and interested in this are ... they suck .
he told me in his experience he 's had to kick men out after inviting them because they were trying to enact porn scenarios with no consideration for the women or they were blatantly disregarding consent .
there is one other guy who is part of the group with his wife but he has a demanding career and they recently had a baby we were trying to organize something with them but then covid happened .
i 'm sure you can find really great guys out there but most of them are part of a couple that also have threesomes and partners do n't always play separately .
or you need to find someone with a bit of prior experience or a person you already know that you trust .
at least that 's how i would try to do it if i were you .
being in a threesome is amazing but many men think they are just going to get pampered by two thirsty chicks .
that 's very far from the truth when women are attracted to each other and not performing sapphic love for the man or a camera .
i made a post about my best threesome i recommend you go in my post history and find it .
what helped me with my fwb at the beginning was also having sex 1 on 1 to see how respectful he was in a scenario that i knew and in which i would n't have hesitated to say no or stop things if i did n't like him .
he 's the kind of man who loves to give pleasure and he 's ok with being on the sidelines at some points during the threesome .

honestly i was kinda hoping god bind goku would be on there because i wanted to get him .
he 's several months old at this point so no harm in adding him .
which only leads me to believe that he 's gon na show up on one of the anniversary banners as a featured fighter .
so a lower octane rating than honda spec for it is fine ?
i tried that just now and it 's easier .
i 'm sorry that you 're dealing with this .
i joined this subreddit because i was dumped and that too was my first relationship .

important that she looks black is closer to what i mean but i also mean what i said .
important for black people that when we are represented it 's not exclusively by the whitest black person available .
i 'm not saying either the whitest black person available is n't black either .
what i am saying is that the selection is about what is valued and often what is valued is a white aesthetic .
that progress is in acknowledging that black is beautiful not beautiful in the extent to which it can approximate a different ideal black by itself is beautiful .
the best outcome is not getting charged by a maniac with a knife .

here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in lgpe and sw/sh
most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public .
also note that for your trade to count for flair every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed .
since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person .

i have not really had any problems being this way but i 'm not going to be surprised at all if something bad does happen due to it .
it 's entirely my fault and other people have to stop acting like it is n't bad for them .
you will potentially suffer consequences eventually in your life if you do not fix what you know will cause it so be prepared for it and do n't bother being upset or surprised when it happens if you wont prevent it .
i played around in retroarch 's dolphin core where you can scale the game 1 pixel at a time i still could n't find a horizontal resolution that has no shimmering even in 640 there 's shimmering which led me to believe that the game originally was like that even on the wii .
i actually have the mega man games on my wii i did n't notice any shimmering when trying them on a crt but i guess it could be hard to notice with all that interlaced flickering going on .
i think i might try hooking up the wii to an lcd television to see if there actually is any shimmering in the original games .
i just fired up retroarch on my computer and tried mega man 9 in 2560 horizontal resolution you can clearly see that every other line is thinner i think i also tried 256 on my crt when trying to find the correct resolution although they should look the same since it 's just 10x the resolution right ?
gradius looked fine too but one time i noticed a power-up that looked kinda fuzzy maybe what you described happened there .
i wonder why that sort of thing happens should n't downscaling the game to half resolution just leave out every other line ?
lastly i just noticed i have n't been using paragraphs like you sorry about that !

actually the original narrator was either grievously injured in a motorcycle accident or got some kind of disease i 'm about 75 sure if was the motorcycle thing but i remember king donated most of the sales of the later audio books in the series to the original narrator healthcare as he was basically unable to care for himself anymore after what happened and then i believe he did indeed actually pass away .
not positive though but pretty sure that 's how it went .

that 's proly because of the enhanced artifact mods .
i know we had enhanced bow loader last season and enhanced auto rifle this season .
i 'm pretty sure there was enhanced fusion loader as part of undying artifact .
so the game might think you already unlocked those so they wo n't drop again .
since most other enhanced loader perks were already in the loot pool when armor 2.0 launched they did n't get hit with the bug .

i experienced someone stonewall me after accusing me of manipulation and lying .
while i sought to understand the situation and make sense of the end of our relationship he continued to tell me i was manipulating to reinstate the relationship .
the stonewalling occurred after i suggested that he get over himself that my queries were about moving forward and moving on not reinstating us .
i now know a lot of back story to things that happened in our relationship because he wrote about it all over reddit and i feel he manipulated me constantly .
he had wanted to be close friends in the end but refused to let me ask about a certain topic .
the stonewalling in the end was still about him being the one in control .
so he had checked out and in the end it has been good that i am cut off .
where i accidentally added him on an app a little later he did n't just block me he hurled abuse at me then stonewalled again .

qol request i am enjoying cassia but one thing i feel her aa build needs is little indicators under her health bar showing when her charged strike attack will proc .
for some reason the visual/sound queue are very delayed maybe not happening until her 2nd attack hits the target ?
so i often find myself unsure of when i will have the proc ready without stopping my aa for a second .
it makes it feel quite clumsy in that sense .
likewise although samuro 's ui has that large indicator in the bottom left of the screen i often do n't want to be taking my eyes off of the action during a fight to check my critical strike count .
could both heroes get the same ui treatment as raynor 's trait ?
cassia with little lightning bolts and samuro with swords .
feedback also and i have seen it 's been said often i feel cassia 's avoidance loss is too punishing .
if the enemy team lacks any reliable cc she can be a joy to play and a bit exhausting because she just keeps moving .
but once the enemy has a single cc that locks her in place for even just a fraction of a second she can be too easily punished .
i hope the team looks at her trait and comes up with a way to make it a little less punishing and tedious .
i also find myself often not wanting to mount up when i do n't take plate of the whale because i do n't want to lose my avoidance .
that kind of decision just does n't feel very good .
ellie sighs and throws herself down on the couch at the back of the tour bus .
it had been almost three months on the road already and the long drives and long days before shows is starting to grate on her she cant really complain too much though she had n't even really expected half of the reception she had got .
originally booked just for the local leg of a tour she had n't in her wildest dreams expect to be booked as the primary support act for the rest of it so the 3 nights turned into 6 months and her small gigs in england has become a complete tour of the usa nearly 90 dates .
but it was her big break it was a way to crack america and so she could n't turn it down .
so she left behind her family her day job and her relationship and gambled everything on this adventure .
as the miles fly by the other hangers on that shared her bus had started to turn in the warmup act of a threepiece group occupying there little corner as well as some of the roadies .
after all ellie was never going to have such a large bus to herself she was n't the star .
stretching and groaning she heads for her own bunk .
pulling off her hoody and laying down in her leggings and sports bra she just tries to relax and close her eyes hopefully when she wakes they would be at the next place the next show and a new chapter of the adventure .
i decided to re-write my first ever prompt from a year ago and try to turn it into something more cohesive and a little more fun .
the basic premise is the same though a singer on tour .
i left the type of singer as well as ellies looks intentionally vague is she an rnb artist ?
let me know what you want her to be and also how this would affect her look hood chick ?
plenty of scope for you to play pretty much whoever you want so get creative .
the premise of her being a support act also gives plenty of scope to turn this into a celeb rp .
ellie will never be someone else but if you want to play the headliner of the tour just tell me who .
i want some story as well as kink and smut in this so do n't think this is just about getting laid .
only message on reddit pms please and i only rp there .
the biggest names in indian cricket could muster only 263,000 votes .
the votes for one of the semi-finals is an extreme outlier something fishy there !
went to sleep about 4 hours ago and woke up 1 hour ago because of the pain .
i looked it up since i have no other way of confirming what exactly is the source of pain .
also i have some odd mass near my hip feels like a bean/tube but only on the left side .
i̇ have n't had period last/this month yet but it 's always been unpredictable .
i live abroad and can not see a doc for another 2-3 months until i go home .
does this sound like a huge emergency or can i wait until i have more symptoms or when pain does not go away ?
i remember this one part were the guy finally figured out he had a strand of hair that was limiting him from his true potential .
mine is the white cape because it glows super bright and has this nice color reflect effect depending on where you are .
is it something that you would n't find if you were with anyone other than your current so ?
i 'm trying to understand if the likes ever outweigh the dislikes in a relationship .
apart from the lucky ones does everyone else just decide to settle or what ?
because from personal experience relationships just seem like too much work .
anyway just trying to figure some things out looking forward to your responses
i would love awards but i 'm pretty sure this subreddit is dead now and nobody is going to give me an award
is it normal to hear/feel a pulsing while tripping ?
i did and it seemed to be directly tied to the intensity of what i was feeling and the mood of it .
if it was n't just me is there a name for this ?
i 'm starting to see an end to my story coming up .
covid has ruined my senior year and all of the milestones and i feel so ungrateful for even being sad about it but i ca n't help it .
beyond that my mom started drinking again last year after 6 years sober and it continues to this day .
i spent my childhood dealing with her alcoholism and i thought it was finally over .
i ca n't deal with it again i just ca n't .
i 've become addicted to smoking cigarettes and weed as an escape and i can already feel myself becoming like my mom .
also i have bipolar disorder and my meds just do n't seem to be working anymore and i failed english this year despite my intelligence because i just ca n't get myself to do any work outside of school whatsoever so i may not even graduate high school .
to top it off my cat died two nights ago .
i had him for 13 years and the loss could n't have come at a worse time .
i know i 'm basically throwing myself a pity party but i just need to put all of the hurt somewhere other than in my head .
i 'm sick of bad news and bad things coming every single day .
i have n't had a day without something bad happening in what feels like forever .
i already have a method in place and the materials i need but i just ca n't bring myself to do it .
my siblings and i are extremely close and my parents and them would never recover .
i fear my death could lead my twin brother and older sister to suicide as well as due to our fucked up family they 're both also mentally unstable .
there 's so much more making life seem terrible that i ca n't think to articulate right now but it 's enough to make me think i need to go .
college may be remote for my very first year and the debt i know it will cause just does n't seem worth it .
i honestly just do n't know what to do .
i want to give up but i ca n't .
i swear i 'm a 20 year old dude and i do n't think i ever found a single one of these memes funny .
not cause it 's offensive '' it 's just dumb .
found out the hard way that the stg is quite expensive to maintain as opposed to smgs and lmgs .

official los 17.1 build gapps magisk have been installed a few weeks ago and everything works fine but i need to update my device firmware a zip file .
note i was updating the firmware via twrp with los 16.0 .
planned procedure to update the firmware of my device oneplus 3t with los recovery ... without having to perform a factory reset
2 click apply update then apply from adb then adb sideload the latest los build zip and the firmware zip in sequence .
ps i would like to thank the great work of the los team carried out day after day despite the current pandemic !
hello r/buildapc i have been looking to update/upgrade some parts of my pc but really do n't know where to start .
the big question is what kind of ssd would work for my build and should i look into getting a new graphics card .
the pc is used for basic web browsing and gaming .
i 'm looking to run a smooth 60 fps at 1920 x 1080 with most games set at high or better if possible .
from what i know a ssd will help with game launches and computer boot up which would be a great benefit for me .
budget is not a huge issue but i 'm looking to keep it under 500 us for more than 1 part .
this is overall a pretty old build that was not originally built by me or a peak performer since inception in 2015 .
i 've had trouble finding reviews of the parts that i have to see how they fair in the current market so if a grand overhaul is recommended i will definitely consider it .
i do n't know what 's been going on with arams lately but i have been getting really unbalanced teams trolls and just very new players that do n't have much grasp of league in general .
i 'll begrudgingly be the tank pick game after game and peel my teammates .
and even then i usually have a good score .
i usually do really well if i get an assassin but it seems like people are playing a lot worse now than they used to and i ca n't really carry them anymore .
i do n't know if it started with the changes they made to all of the champions or maybe something about season 10 is bringing lots of extremely casual players this is me putting it nicely in now or maybe the quarantine but it 's been very frustrating lately .
this is my main game mode and my favorite to play but my teammates just have n't been making it fun for me lately .
to be fair to espn the time limit and language barrier probably made it difficult to prepare a lot of that not to mention they 're just taking the game feed from another network .
to be not fair after all these years what the fuck was i expecting
i loved that group of shows degrassi south of nowhere instant star ... when i was a teenager and want to go and reexplore all of them .

have been to kona and enjoyed their coffee immensely .
i imagine this might be an issue of distance and volatility but is it possible for someone on the west coast usa to order light roasted 100 kona coffee ?
why would there need to be 100 different species of sea slug or around 20 different species of elephant but there 's only 1 homosapien ?
something interesting i found out is the aardvark is the only species in the order tubulidentata .
so what is the similarity between humans and aardvarks ?

it 's not like i dont find people sexually attractive or have fantasies about people .
but i recently got a girlfriend and i 'm not sure about sex or making out .
i like a little kiss when we meet or holding hands when we want and cuddling is great .
but sex and make out sessions is just a bit too much .
sex every now and then is great but everyday is far too much .
i 'm just not that interested in it anymore .
i dont think it 's all its cracked up to be .
i guess what i 'm asking is the best way to say that to her .
i would n't say i 'm i 'm asexual but i think you would know a good way to say this to her .
i 'm looking to upgrade my peripherals specifically my desk ikea ekbacken with two alex drawers my monitors two samsung u28e590d and my speakers pebble speakers from amazon
right now i know i want to upgrade to a 8 ' karlby veneer 'desktop ' i want to add a pixio px7 144hz monitor with a triple monitor mount .
i 'm stuck on the speakers though i 'm in between the audioengine p4s and the audioengine a2 should i be going for the bluetooth/wireless or the wired version ?
i 'm trying to remember a comic i read when i was younger probably 90s era .
the comic i 'm looking for was an anti hero like punisher et al but specifically he would break the backs and paralyze the criminals that he fought .
perhaps it was n't a marvel comic but i figured this would be a good place to ask .
i 'm posting here because i have a number of questions about gender identity .
i understand these questions may be difficult to answers because gender is n't viewed the same by everyone and all people have different experiences but if you can please try to help me understand .
firstly i wanted to ask is it necessary to have dysphoria to be transgender ?
i 've always viewed gender dysphoria as a mental disorder akin to depression anxiety or discomfort caused by being ones birth gender .
i do n't mean to use mental disorder here to discount anybody 's experience as i 'm not saying you are crazy or anything but i 've always viewed this to be true .
i 've always viewed dysphoria and being transgender as being synonymous but some claim they are not necessarily .
if they are n't synonymous why would someone want to transition ?
what would make someone who likes to dress and act as the opposite sex different from a cross dresser ?
why is fully identifying as the opposite sex necessary for someone who does n't experience dysphoria ?
it 's all very confusing to me in all honesty .
i apologize if anything i said came off as offensive i genuinely want to learn .
i have friends who have gone through phases where they experienced dysphoria but after a few years they said the feelings went away so they never really transitioned .
also if anybody in here is a fan of hardcore or metal music seeyouspacecowboy is a great band with a mtf trans vocalist .
can someone please explain how costco works in regards to payment ?
the instacart debit card is a master card and costco only takes visa .

1 a record label launches a new record for an artist and it sells 1m copies and goes platinum how do they get that 1m figure where does it come from ?
2 disney launch the new avengers 26 thanos returns again it 's monday after opening weekend and disney say takings were 200,000,000 so where does that come from ?
3 sony launch the ps4 ultimate pro pro edition after 1 month it 's sold 1m copies .
now i can only assume that 1m is because that 's what sony have sold to all of their distributors worldwide but obviously many of those 1m could be sitting in the stock rooms of those distributors .
so although sony have sold 1m units there is n't actually 1m units in the hands of consumers ... ?
my bf really likes femdom and wants to do anal a lot but every time we begin he finds he has stingy pain .
we use lots of lube and even with a single finger he feels this pain .
him and i are not into pain on his part so i never force him through it but i would really like to during our upcoming milking session reward him with some anal fucking .
i want so desperately to believe that things will be good for me in the future .
i want to be positive and see the best in things .
but i do n't know how to because all i have ever known is suffering .
multiple childhood traumas so i 've had panic attack disorder since i was about 6 severe anorexia that almost killed me i was inpatient for four months and i 'm much better now but i continue to battle it daily a pretty severe autoimmune disease i have to take low dose chemo to manage and i just found out i have herpes most likely from when i was r*ped a year and a half ago .
how am i not supposed to feel like the hits are just going to keep coming ?
i 'm on meds and i see a therapist and i exercise regularly and eat healthy .
probably could meditate more or try to find hobbies but frankly nothing interests me at all .
how do you find reason to look forward to life when it feels like life has always just been suffering ?
just wanted to thank everyone on here who has supported and viewed the stream you 're all wonderful i stream every monday wednesday and friday so feel free to come stop in

i bought a refurbished macbook pro from a reputable reseller about 7 months ago and it 's worked absolutely perfectly until about a week ago .
since then about every other day i 'll be working away without running much just firefox and mail and suddenly i 'll hear a very quiet faint high-pitched whine coming from the macbook pro .
at that point although i can still move the pointer around the various parts of the ui start freezing .
so for instance if i move the pointer to the dock the dock will appear and then freeze .
i 'll then try to navigate a web browser window or move it around and i ca n't in fact nothing at all works except the mouse pointer .
i then have to hard reset by turning it off and on with the power button and everything seems fine .
however the same thing just happened a half hour ago and when i rebooted it worked for another minute or two then did the same thing it 's never happened twice so fast before .
i then rebooted a again and this time it 's been working fine so far .
last time i rebooted i did a diagnostic by pressing the d '' key when rebooting the diagnostic found nothing wrong .
google has surprisingly not revealed a lot to me in terms of what this might be .
i have tried system restoring to two different points in time and did not work .
i do n't have my windows software to do a system reset or any of the other options .
this all started with my mouse pointer randomly being slowed down without any reason .
restarted my computer and now i 'm here and unable to boot up .
i used to use this super good wig store ages ago and i need help finding it again !
im gon na provide the best description i can .
it was really unique because you could customise the wig before you bought it .
you could choose the length and colour of the wig and wether it had pigtails that could clip on .
im so sorry that its vague but i really hope someone knows the site !

hey guys anyone got the managerial accounting 5th edition printed book for acct 2020 ?
a small local grocer was reselling 5lb bags of ardent mills h r that they 'd gotten from their wholesaler .
their website says they mill to 9–13 protein content which seems extraordinarily vague .
does this flour really vary that much from batch to batch ?
in which case how does a typical batch sold in the san francisco bay area behave ?
with the corona going on we are moving mainly to online classes meaning i need a good computer .

if anyone has any recommendations or advice that would be helpful .
i got the dell xps 15 a few years back for school but picked it mainly because it had decent specs for gaming .
at first it was quite reliable for games such as overwatch pubg csgo etc but recently has struggled to get more than 20 fps on csgo or even minecraft .
i notice significant tearing when playing fps games and the laptop has become slower in general .
i understand that the laptop only has one storage drive on the laptop so could that be getting slower as i fill up the storage therefore leading to performance issues ?
sadly he is nothing that he can use to back this claim .
the article is about the claim he made against china .

yeah i know it 's another dimension and it 's easy to just assume the laws of physics are different but i 'm not really satisfied with that answer considering gordon can survive there without a helmet no less and the vortigaunts do n't seem to have any trouble living on earth in hl2 .
i wonder if anyone has legit non-handwave serious theories about how xen works .
why do the islands float but there 's a clear direction of gravity ?
one of the original skyboxes appears to have a sun that appears to be reflected over the horizon . ''
breen gives that short speech in hl2 worlds stretched thin across the membrane where dimensions intersect '' .
could xen be a planet somehow stretched '' in higher dimensions ?
one simpler theory that just occurred to me the air islands and gravity were all held together by the nihilanth and it all collapsed after he died .
a place for members of r/painfree to chat with each other
i saw a really dry-yet-interesting talk from a british architect .
the gist was that los angeles is one of the worst cities in the world for living space satisfaction way below much senser cities .
apparently design here is based much more on return on investment than making places people want to live .
it 's we we have these shitty apartments with kitchens that are good for nothing and balconies that are too small for a chair .
if you cook a lot then you rent a place with a better kitchen etc .
but we generally have a price point and just get one of a few bad layouts that pop up in a neighborhood with the least scary commute .
it 's not really a choice it 's a math problem .
but there are cities waaay more dense than la where almost everyone has rooftop balconies more parking and unique units .
seems like better zoning laws and tax incentives to build better units can make it happen .
i really wish we had better living spaces for the masses in this city .
correct but a market for routing payments can force the fee down .
nodes attempting to charge above market rate will be ignored and routed around .
you said that it 's within the players control if the game crashes and then you talked about your pc .
you did n't say that it 's only for pc .
also that would mean that all the other consoles are badly setup .
well maybe you are right i mean having too much friends in paladins is known for bugging and also crashing your game so maybe you should just have no friends and you would have no problem 😀 .
you logic is still retarded if your game crashes you are not allowed to play against players basically punishing the player even tho the game already does that by simply not working ?
man you are one of those pc masterrace guys right ?
i watch both shows and i enjoy them both .
people like to shit on friends because yea so there are better sitcoms out there .
but why ca n't i enjoy my mediocre shows without people shoving the office parks and recs down my throat .
ownhammer is definitely one of the brand names i hear most often .
so far i 've gotten by on just free irs although i did buy acoustic irs from 3 sigma audio and they worked decently at the time but i 've upgraded my audio interface since then so i want to try it again and see what kind of difference it makes .

the cdc said that because of the circulation on planes airborne viruses don't spread easily .

i do n't like akash banerjee but he was kind of right about this one .
their point is that they think that putting tagore 's words in today 's context is ridiculous as modi is nothing like the british rule .
tbh i do n't think modi 's rule is comparable to british rule but still if we read tagore 's works it is n't entirely about british rule but about authoritarianism and ideas .
tagore 's words if taken as ideas work for any time or context .
you know you can go to your settings and change that right ?
you 're whinging about something entirely in your control .
if you let classical mechanics hit you you deserved it
horrendous amount of work to see if each reviewer is both discerning few fives and plenty of threes and lower and has the same taste as you .

my dad told me the flu kills way more people every year than covid. i told him that it 's been less than 5 months .
i agree but there were a few dark seasons in the middle where the producers were pushing the reality show twists hard and the cooking suffered significantly .
the 9th season texas had the chefs skiing shooting ingredients with a rifle and chopping ingredients out of an ice block in the finale .
thankfully they toned down the twists and the later seasons have had a better focus on cooking .

it literally says 300,000 buddhists and 1,500 monastaries were destroyed by a single hindu king in kashmir .
and then it gives even more evidence of genocides committed by other hindu rulers

and there was like a 10 year old in my class who was way better at it than me .

oh i already have a ps4 so i could get nioh 2 now if i wanted .
i just was n't sure if i should submit to my impulses and get it now or wait until a pc port .
i 've always gone with playstation and pc gaming combined that way i never miss out on those sweet playstation exclusives and i get to play my favorite games on pc at the same time .
i was able to fix it with a mod thanks for the reply though
mostly based on my experience with the game and with the general idea of the psychological effect it has on people .
mood is a big word with lots of shades in it..
the thing is why should i share my mood ?
and most important how many of my friend would really need to know about my mood ?
and we definitely shipped out some jews to germany at some point .

i kinda had the same thing but reversed was attracted to men only and came out as bi shortly after coming out as trans and getting t but i think it had way more to do with being more confident and comfortable with my body .

the story writing has gotten significantly better over the years imo .
the older story content is awkwardly paced in comparison to newer chapters .

you absolutely can not have your mass higher than your available tonnage it makes you entirely too slow .
there really is no exception to this as your ability to move quickly outweighs the value of any armor .
you 're putting too much on this build while it sits on the worst wheels in the game .
at least get some 6x medium wheels on there instead which have higher tonnage to boot .
you might wan na snag some apc steering wheels on the market because they 're much cheaper than other wheel but boast pretty good durability while keeping your power score low .
i recommend the hot red engine it does n't require energy and has it super useful up to end game .
the hardcore engine is fine as well start with that .
do n't mix a fixed cannon with a turret cannon pick one and build accordingly .
if you use the judges you can use them with the growl without a genny and still have one energy left for an engine .
if you insist on using fuel do n't mount the crappy 5 fuel drum as it 's too much of a liability and will get you killed fast due to your flimsy blue ammo crates .
use the blue fuel 10 fuel instead as it has almost triple the durability of the crappy fuel drum .
however i love brave foolish players who go for the 15 fuel when they pop like a zit after getting hit by a cannon blast .

do you think that sort of government action is over reach and a violation of human rights ?
because there is do doubt it is more effective at fighting the virus .
so why do you get to say whatever particular level of government action you support is necessary and correct and anyone who supports anything less than that it essentially evil ?

this post is not a meme/shitpost so has been removed .
it 's why their hair goes radically gray so fast .
rather than leave you with this i 've something of a disappear guide i 've thought of over the years that i 'd recommend you take some tips from .
hopefully this practical advise will serve to enable your escape better than simple get out '' posts ever could .
birth certificate social security card passport drivers licenses everything .
any keepsakes you want to take you also need to bring with you in one fell swoop .
you will also need to pack changes of clothes and at least a set of clothes you could interview in .
2 if you have a car of your own you could use this as a new abode for temporary shelter until you 've found a shelter to take you in .
churches community centers there 's lots of places that could at least point you to more resources .
if you only have a regular old school backpack i recommend using old plastic grocery bags to protect things that ca n't get wet used to do some bike commuting and this proved very helpful .
if you have to hoof it i 'm sure that videos showing how to train hop are available if you 're desperate .
alternatively if you 've got some better public transport in your area you should avail yourself of it .
3 your electronics and online accounts are all compromised ! ! !
this happened to me had to nuke a lot of my previous online profile .
factory reset your phone format your laptop/desktop and use a cyber cafe coffee shop wifi etc .
tie your accounts to these new e-mails delete the old e-mail and maximize your privacy settings .
if he 's got access to them or knows about them consider deleting the accounts and starting fresh .
if the accounts are public and ca n't make him unable to see them cough reddit cough i 'd recommend nuking them and starting fresh .
4 if you have accounts that are yours that he 's also on you need to drain them before he does .
this should probably be the first thing you do .
5 tell local pd that you 're doing this completely voluntarily .
the reason for this is so they understand not to bother you with well-being checks .
6 if your documents are somewhere where you ca n't get them without him helping you i think they are technically your property and you could ask for police assistance to convince him to return what is yours .
7 call every women 's shelter church mosque community center and any other place where you think charitable people are who can help you would be .
there are resources and they could pay off for you .
8 call friends of yours too who may be sympathetic to your plight and able to offer a place to crash for a few nights .
9 if you 're healthy enough for it and it does n't bother you consider military service if all else fails .
i 'm lucky in that i never had to do so but it may prove an option .
10 use your head keep calm act with lightning speed and most importantly of all
well if either of them have tested positive they probably would 've worn one or they probably would n't have shown up .

in its current state it is ineffective and does n't work .
a little over half of all eligible social security recipients receive at least 50 of their annual income from their social security .
about 30 receive at least 90 of their income from the program .
to put that another way social security provides the majority income for about 23 million americans with another 22 million receiving but not relying on the program .
another 16 million receive benefits from disability or survivor benefits of which over 2/3rds count social security as their primary income .
to say that a program that keeps nearly 1/6th of the country out of poverty 'does n't work ' or is 'ineffective ' is patently absurd .
could the program be better absolutely but to claim it does n't work is nonsense .
it also is a huge burden on our government as it takes up like a good chunk of our mandatory spending .
when not fucked with these taxes cover the majority of the program without issue .
simply removing the cap on income over 200,000 would make the program solvent until 2095 and likely longer given that the program only ever estimates out to 75 years in advance .
it takes up a good chunk of manditory spending but since it brings in the majority of its own income it is a fairly neutral program .
i think that if we privatized it we could help workers get a better return and help cut back the governments spending which could help us cut some taxes like capital gains or income taxes .
slashing social security to cut capital gains taxes is evil .
the whole point of social security is that it is social security .
the goal of the program is n't to chase higher returns it is to provide a minimum social safety net .
putting the money into the roulette wheel that is wall street is gambling with the future of our workers .
to say that is a bad bet is an understatement .
if we had low cost funds for average workers to invest in.. it could give companies a huge market that is untapped and could give workers much better returns then they deserve .
if anyone else has other viewpoints feel free to comment !
if none of my other arguments convinced you i 'll try with the funny one since i 'm guessing you 're a capitalist at heart .
under the most recent republican plan to privatize social security proposed by paul ryan the us government would have ended up the single largest shareholder in the us stock market .
each year we pay about 1 trillion in social security taxes .
if this money was invested year after year for the purposes of retirement income we 'd have tens of trillions floating around in the stock market .
given that the total value of the stock market sat at 30 trillion last year ...
i mean fine by me full communism now government owns the means of production by owning the stock market and all .
jokes aside having this enormous pool of money floating around would severely fuck up our financial system .
a big part of the problem in 2008 was that we had a lot of money looking for a profitable way to invest .
if we suddenly add several trillion dollars into that search it is going to screw up incentives something fierce .

nta ... . she is doing this on purpose.. she actually knows its coming and is n't willing to do the mature and sanitary thing and use some form of sanitary device ?
come on.. pads are nothing like what they use to be in the 50s there are pads tampons period under the cup thingy there are so many options for women to use these days its completely a bs move to refuse to do anything about it .
i find this extremely rude and disrespectful of her to keep doing this to you and i do not blame you at all for being annoyed and not wanting it to happen again its not good for the sheets or the mattress either .
i just keep picturing it in my head and its so disgusting .. and i 'm a female thats been having periods for a long ass time i hate waking up to a possible leak or bleed through or even a surprise period start.. but to actively engage in knowing its going to happen and being okay with blood everywhere including all over your partner ?
you are n't being misogynistic unreasonable or the ah here .
i ca n't imagine ever wanting to compromise that .
honestly i feel like this would be a deal breaker if she did n't start acting more respectfully and maturely about her periods .
if shes willing to do that or allow that to happen to your bed.. what about the couch ?
periods are n't fun.. but they are our reality and responsibility accidents are one thing.. purposefully letting it happen ?
i had an older model of the k2 vo2 and i liked them but eventually after five years they were worn out .
therefore i bought the new version with the one sided frame last year .
within a month i had the screw on the back wheel rip apart .
losing your rear wheel including stop block while going downhill in a group of people during a city skate event is terrifying .
it takes some real effort to resist the instinct to put your weight into a non-existent wheel and brake .
somehow i managed to not murder any other skaters or myself in the process .
when i brought the skates back to the store i was informed about the recall that existed at the time and they replaced the screw with a stronger one .
i asked why they only replaced that one and was told the one at the back takes the most force so only that one needs to be replaced .
that sounds like negligence on the part of the store as u/rollerblading_mod pointed out the store should have replaced all of the axles or sent your skates to k2 to have them do it or just exchanged your original skates for the upgraded/non-faulty version .
today one of the front wheels came off again with the screw literally ripping apart .
i check the website again and would n't you know these murder-frames are still the current model apparently ?
it 's not like i do anything wild on these things .
k2 is an american company based in seattle wa usa .
between general liability and the legendarily lawsuit-happy aspect of us culture k2 gains nothing and stands to lose too much to continue selling a faulty design .
as such the current that is post-recall vo2 s skates would feature frames axles that solved the problem that forced the recall of the earlier models .
in fact ricardo lino recently posted a review https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pynlnjsx_2s of the trio s 100 including some jumps and stair-bashing .
he notes that the axles on the trio s 100 are 8mm axles instead of the 6mm axles used on most k2 skates .
and now i get to figure out how to obtain new skates in my size during the coronaclysm .
yeah ... unfortunately the recent and sudden surge in popularity of inline skating means that a lot of the shops are out of stock until manufacturing can catch-up to match the demand .
most of the bigger and better-known vendors would have been cleaned-out with regard to the more-popular models and sizes .
however you may be able to find some of the smaller and lesser-known shops and they may still have a selection of certain models and/or sizes .
im actually uploading the video to show what actually happened since some people think it was planned .
i have to agree i do n't see him beating connor now either .
justin 's left hand lit him up connor would do the same thing .
god this was hard to watch justin brutalized tony and i still ca n't believe it .
i keep telling myself i 'm going to leave because of the cold weather but i just hit my 30s and i 'm still here with no plans of moving any time soon .
the number of amazing places you can go hiking camping or even just golfing including oak hill locust hill and many more is absolutely amazing .
i mean i just moved a few miles and now i 'm in trail town usa '' not a bad thing to be known for in my book !
if they ask tell them you ran 40 miles then if they say what ?

this guy needs to accept that the game rules are either followed or that any chamges need to be discussed and agreed on as a group .
he ca n't expect to changw the rules every five seconds because he can '' .
especially if he is n't arguing the legitimacy of his chamges when he 's a player using those same features while he 's out of the dm role .
if he wo n't allow for that he should n't be in that role .
leave him on the curb and stick with the other sms dmsin your rotation .
that allows you to use skills only used when surrounded without a baton pass .
y'all can have khabib vs tony once gaethje wins the belt

she probably will be too embarrassed to snoop again .
on a serious note does she have self esteem issues ?

i 'd have a serious conversation on what this is n't right but there may be some issues outside of your relationship driving her and she 'll need to deal with those .
every animal in the world has what is called a fight or flight '' response to danger or stressful situations .
your fight or flight response is becoming active during times of anger which means for whatever reason your brain is telling you that if you do n't do or say something at that moment your life could be in danger .
you also probably get an adrenaline rush from it .
i bet that once everything is calmed down that you see yourself shaking or at least you did the first few times that this happened .
that shaking is the adrenaline leaving your nervous system .
the best you can do without therapy for now is try to consciously switch to flight instead of fight mode .
which means just walk away when you get angry things may go unresolved at that point but at least you wo n't be beating on someone .
i 'm saying that they 're criticizing them for it .

look back at the history and be honest please !
look at what happened after the murder of cesar .
the senators thought that they were saving the republic and that they would be celebrated for killing an obvious tyrant .
but ... .. the average roman loved cesar he was popular had brought glory and riches to the republic and most did n't see him as a tyrant .
so cassius and brutus along with their fellow co-conspirators had to flee rome and they plunged the republic into a civil war and ensured the permanent destruction of the republic .
so i think with the growing unpopularity of the jedi it would have been seen as a coup .
with the numerous senators of palpatine 's side the people probably would have rioted against the order .

hey guys not too sure where to post this .
but i am currently on furlough from my job and the company is n't keeping us as updated as expected .
we are getting the 80 from the government and 10 from the company of the mean amount of hours during the past 4 weeks before lockdown .
we were then told we had to take a week of annual leave during the furlough scheme all on the same week .
of course we where happy to be getting a bit of extra money as holiday pay for most is higher than average pay .
until they mentioned we would only be getting 80 of our holiday pay .
i know the guidelines do not mention a company only paying 80 of annual leave as it is up to the company not the government .
i had booked another weeks leave before covid-19 starting in a week in may .
if that is taken off me will i only get 80 of my holiday pay ?
if so i only have 2 weeks holiday left hopefully at full pay whereas others in the business will have 3 weeks of full holiday pay .
is there any guidelines to stop this from happening ?
i didnt realize how essential they were on builds until i saw they used them so i tried them myself and its so much easier to stay on target .
the m13 isnt so bad in this department though .
makes a huge difference on guns like the m4 however .
first i 've heard of the 1 arrest means hundreds more argument

i know what you mean and that 's what i mean simp is an aggressive player even when he snipes so i think that the mobility would be on his side
i think his reason for using the hdr is just to try it out and see how it feels and so he can make the final decision of what he 'll use
you do n't have overpowered arena champs like rotos siphi arbiter tormin hegemon .
if you at gold3-4 than no reason to bother much .
you can just work on better gear wait for better champions just for fun replacing one or two of them fu-shan gala foli zargala tayrel are ok champs too .
been really enjoying the random interaction with twitch viewers .
comes with a charger unused headphones and original box .
i had it for about two years so i is not perfect by all means .
there are no cracks and only one tiny scrape shown in the pictures .
there are also light scratches in the front which you do n't see .
the two cases it comes with are minimalistic but definitely prevent damage incase of a drop .
first one is a blue spigen and the other is a apple leather case with some wear on it .
i prefer it to be worn i think it looks extremely nice and you will too !
battery health is 82-83 forgot which one because i reset it .
any question let me know and please comment before a pm !
i got my first banjo a couple of weeks ago with the goal of learning to play bluegrass banjo during quarantine and i love it so far !
only real issue to date is finding picks that work for me .
i bought a cheap plastic set to start with but they were too big and also felt clunky .
i 've now got some adjustable metal finger picks on the way but am not sure what to do for a thumb pick .
the plastic thumb picks i have are too big they 're basically usable but loose enough that they sometimes shift when i play and cause me to miss more notes .
i hear i can resize them by dipping them in hot water but that seems like a great way to melt the picks burn my fingers and end up worse off than i am now .
i 'd rather just buy picks that fit but i do n't know how the sizing works and my state is on lockdown so i ca n't test anything out in person .
anybody have advice on thumb picks i can order online that work well and are small and/or easily adjustable ?
i 'm a woman with thin fingers but not like an outlier in terms of hand size .
is there a point at which characters actually feel like talents/gear make them more powerful ?
since mobs scale to your level killing a level 77 feels no different than killing a level 20 did other than numbers are inflated .
nothing makes me feel any stronger than i did back when i started .
is there a point where that 's no longer the case ?
hello after figuring out that my cars stock electrical is n't enough to run 2 amps i 'm looking to upgrade my battery i 've ordered the big 3 kit now i 'm looking into better battery 's what would y'all suggest in terms of a battery
skar lp-750.1dv2 wired at 2 ohms it does around 600w rms and id say like ... 1100-1300w max power
crunch px-1000.4 running my door speakers each channel will be wired at 4 ohms with 75w rms each channel with max power advertised around 125w per channel
looking for a battery that will be able to keep up i do n't play my systems for long maybe like 2-4 hours longest but that also involves me turning it down to talk or turning it down to hear my navigation .
i am a 2 hand melee build and prefer bolstering but could do ss armor if it 's possible .

except that later in the series the aiel make it clear that they only care about the car'a'carn and care nothing for wetlander prophecies about the dragon .
my headset audio is no longer playing game audio .
it has previously and i 'm not sure why it is n't anymore .
does anyone have an idea of what the issue may be ?
some band spilled the beans on facebook and then some skaters have been talking about it .
hey i need some help saving my game i know this game is permadeath but i want to log out and come back to my run .
so this has occurred to me a lot over the years but this is the first time i was at my computer .
has anyone noticed that the average person in the marine corps is a lance corporal while the average soldier is a specialist .
so most marines are getting e-3 pay while most army people are getting e-4 pay .
is this accurate or is there something i do n't know ?
i purchased a lamy 2k medium nib from goulet in december of 2018 .
doing the math that means it 's been just under 18 complete months in my collection .
the filler knob rotates but you can feel the internal threads failing to engage the plunger and you can see the plunger no longer moves .
i have several twsbi 's so i 'm familiar with the basics of how a filler mechanism works .
that being said the lamy 2k is not designed or intended to be user serviceable .
i have to say i 'm more than a little disappointed .
lamy has such a good reputation and the 2k has a massive following of fans here and elsewhere .
it was my first gold nib pen and my first pen over 100 .
considering i have twsbi 's not to mention pilots and jinhaos that cost a fraction of the price are older and continue to work flawlessly i 'm pretty down on this .
i carry it in my shirt pocket at work and it sits on my nightstand at home .
the pen gets flushed with water between every filling .
it has never been dropped or jarred and i have never tightened the filler knob beyond its limit .
considering this treatment and the relatively short life i have to imagine this is a manufacturing defect .
lamy has a warranty https www.lamy.com/en/warranty that claims a 2 year window where they will do repair at no charge .
i purchased this pen from an authorized retailer less than two years ago treated it well and it no longer functions .
i think it should qualify for them to do repairs .
has anyone ever dealt with lamy for warranty work ?
i ask primarily to evaluate if going through the warranty claim worth my time .
if lamy is n't willing to bend over backwards to make this right on their dime i 'll probably just post this for sale as parts on ebay or penswap .
i 'm sure someone out there wants a spare lamy 2k nib cap and section at a bargain basement price .
if the warranty process is honest and quick i 'll consider keeping it but my faith in the company is pretty low right now .
the company is asking the workers for donations to help cover the cost .
i used to work for the same company so right now i 'm torn as to whether or not they 're scamming the workers or if they were scammed by the cleaners .
also due to the nature of the job it involves health care almost nobody goes directly to the main office and it does n't look as though they 're making people leave the other locations while they 're being cleaned with this special chemical.
is there an endless combat challenge map which only has regular unarmed thugs ?

does the name sound similar to your old name ?
the day that cycle 12 premiered tyra had a toga party '' on her talk show since the c12 casting episode was at caesar 's palace keeping with the theme and her audience was filled with girls 5'7 and under .
i remember when i first read the casting call for cycle 13 way back in the day and when i saw that i thought it was a typo and so this was when tyra confirmed it on her talk show .
i thought cycle 13 would be terrible but surpisingly it ended up becoming one of my favorite cycles .
she also had angelea show up and talked with her for a bit for those who might not remember she was a semi-finalist in c12 and she had some sorority girls play a trivia game against sam joslyn analeigh and bre .
the show is pretty cringy but still worth checking out .
can anybody shed light on whether these have decent bass after eqing in the app ?
we all know that john must have gotten his ability from his mother since his dad is a cripple .
their ability is to copy and amp up other peoples powers and use it as their own .
now what if john 's mom had joined ember and they somehow found a way to isolate that same power and put it into syringes and when they inject themselves with it their own ability becomes amped up ?
its just a theory of course and we 'll be waiting for uru to continue the series to find out more .
i am proud to have owned a 2013 xterra pro-4x and have a retractable trunk cover and fabric liner for someone in the seattle/snoho county area who needs it .
i really do n't want to throw it away and know they are n't that expensive ... it just hurts me in my planet .
if no one in the area claims it i can also ship it somewhere if it is n't crazy .
may someone please take the intro from tommy 's youtube rank intro but instead of i just got the youtube rank he says i just killed a woman .
but it was something that i adapted to you know .
it was just an accident when i was a kid .
sometimes it felt a lot more than that a lot scarier .
doctors told me there was a chance i could see but that it was near impossible about as likely as ‘winning the lottery thirteen times over ' .
the scariest part was that i could always tell when it was darker .
when my lights were turned off i would scream as a child and beg for the monsters to stop watching me .
my mother would always say the same thing there 's nothing out there no ones coming for you.
as i got older things changed my family did n't know how to look after someone who not only was blind but had post traumatic stress with psychotic symptoms .
the walls smelled of smoke and rot corroded through to the wood .
what most people do n't know is that braille is n't in the shapes of letters it 's different actually .
which meant i could never know what the strange shapes on the walls were when i put my hands past them .
sadly the caressing of a wall was as close as i could get to a conversation .
good morning remember to take your pills keep your mouths zipped and your eyes peeled ladies and gentleman
read aloud the woman on the other side of the intercom from a script
i started my days by playing chess they happened to be the only hospital i 've known to own a chess board and pieces that had braille helpings on them .
i had a long game going with a guy i called jim i never knew his name but he had a smell i would recognise he never spoke but every day when i moved my piece by the next morning a countermove had been made .
after the first few months i was able to recognise smells of the different rooms .
what was really strange was that in each and every room i could smell something eerily close to rotten eggs .
a strange establishment but none the less the routine helped .
i did n't realise how much until one morning i woke up and right in front of me on the rusty cart sat my pills .
stunned by this i jumped up knocking the pills to the floor .
as i ran to exit my room and opened the door i looked down and seen the horrifying nurses with their mouths stitched close and eyelids removed .
they moved in a robotic fashion dropping their pills off then exiting that 's when i looked to the walls and realised what was indented by scrapings and scratches .

i 'm recently trying to incorporate herbs into my daily practice but it 's really hard since i do n't have my own garden yet to grow said herbs .
i wo n't get my own greenhouse until this september i asked for a greenhouse for my birthday and until then i ca n't really do any gardening or take in plantss because my family might get suspicious .
i also ca n't buy herbs from local gardeners or farmers near me because of the quarantine .
would store bought herbs grocery stores maybe be sufficient while i wait out the quarantine ?
i was playing a game with friends and a nsfw topic came up .
i being the sex repulsed ace i am felt a bit upset .
i had already had a bit of a rotten night .
i asked them to stop several times and explained why .
i just i feel like being ace does n't matter to others and that people kept crossing my boundaries .
i just wish that the game did n't turn out like it did .
i wish it did n't bother me or that i could fake it till i make it .
i dunno what else but i just feel like that being me being ace gets in the way and i hate it

is it allowed to sell brands like nike gucci ferrari ... as virtual items .
for example i offer those brands on my websites as kinda game and when people buy it they will own virtual ferrari ?
is there difference if they buy it for real money vs for some virtual currency ?
can someone tell me if my understanding of how a program is executed by a cpu is correct ?
please write down how you 'd describe the process so i can get a new perspective .
when a program is written it is first compiled into machine code which consists of sets of instructions for the cpu which are stored in the ram .
the cpu goes through each ram address one by one to execute each command getting adding and storing values from other addresses etc .
after reading this far i feel like v14 a bit rushed in many parts some section almost like a draft outline from the usual maruyama .
theres potential to make the volume in to 2 books like holy kingdom arc but i dont know the vibe of v14 feels like the author rushed it and only fleshed out certain parts of the chapters..
the philip section feels overly long and verbose compared to other sections..
the azuth part seems fleshed out both the combat and the meeting with bluerose
if the rumors are true that mariyama got bored with the series i wont mind having him create outline for overlord next novels and have other ln writer flesh out the story in his style .
after all this is not the first time wn or ln writer hit the wall and need editors to help finish
on behalf of the council of magic i chancellor paraph am pleased to provisionally offer you a studentship at the academy of lyrithna the most prestigious institute of magical education in the world .
please accept my personal congratulations for this outstanding achievement .
in offering you a position at the academy the council of magic has demonstrated its firm belief that you are among the magical exemplary a belief the academy hopes has not been misplaced .
since its inauguration in 1792 the academy of lyrithna and its influence on the magical community has remained a closely guarded secret .
the opening of this most secret letter has released an inviolable and ever-binding malediction upon you magician if you speak a word about the academy to anyone other than those aware of its existence you shall meet a most unfortunate end .
in light of this forthcoming opportunity your demise for naivety would be considered a tragedy .
i look forward to officially welcoming you to the academy alongside the other extraordinary magicians chosen by the council of magic this fall .
honoured magician please respond with a seal of acceptance or rejection within a single lunar cycle .
failure to respond to this letter will result in cancellation of your offer with utmost haste and immediate loss of all memories regarding the academy .
i am hoping to restart this rp with a little incentive from a previous alumnus of lyrithna .
the main premise of this story is that each player in the rp will be creating a young magician between the ages of 18 to 24 approximately 5 10 players will be accepted who will be attending the academy of lyrithna after graduating from their respective schools .
the academy is a top secret institute founded to support young magicians and foster the development of their sorcery .
very few people know of lyrithna 's existence even the location of the academy is confidential .
the academy is a guaranteed ticket to success for any one lucky enough to get a foot inside the door and graduates are often found occupying high-ranking positions in the magical community .
there have been whispers in the circus the body in charge of governing the global magical community that the academy has been compromised that the students are in danger .
the academy and the council of magic have been quick to quash any worries but some people are still suspicious .
the only question is ... will you accept the academy 's invitation ?
please feel free to ask any questions that you might have !
this role play will be written as a group in prose using google docs .
to practice with magic variables i 'm trying to create a shortcut that will tell me what percentage of earth 's population is infected with covid19 .

there has got to be a less clunky way to do this !
bought seven cheap feeder comets from a local place to add to my 750 gal pond last week .
pond was inherited and well established mostly lilies and hornwort .
i 've added other misc plants like elodea but they 're minor players .
no other inhabitants they perished in the six month gap between the old owners moving out and us moving in .
anyways acclimated the comets to temps and sent them off on their way and have n't seen them since .
i assume they 're still alive and l think i know where they 're hiding but am leaving them be .
i 've tried feeding them small amounts of food a couple times a day .
as far as i can tell they have n't eaten any of it so i 've just been skimming it out a few hours after feedings .
i bought them mostly for the purpose of keeping my bug population in check .
i was just tossing them feed because i did n't want to make their dietary change too abrupt .
i just also do n't want to add a bunch of food if all it 's going to do is feed the algae .
i 'd love for them to come out and say hey eventually but ca n't really force that .
i 'm fairly confident they have n't been picked off by a predator .
i did a 90 at least water change 5 weeks ago they have proper aeration all levels check out water temps have been hovering around 70. ph has been 8.0ish but steady .
added pond salt before adding and water has been treated .
🤷 i seriously have no clue if they still exist .
only thing i 've noticed is the larvae putzing around the slow spots seem to be less of a thing .
this is a decently long read and i feel like i started to ramble at a certain point ... apologies ahead of time .
pretty sure i 'm on day 6-7 do n't really remember and i had probably the worst experience i 've ever had in my life .
everything was normal until i was watching some weird show on adult swim that started giving me these weird vibes .
i do n't know how to describe it other than i just felt like i should n't be watching it .
i switched to some mindless comedy stuff and the feeling went away .
about 15 mins later i decided to go to bed .
let my dog out to go to the bathroom brushed my teeth and as soon as i laid down in bed boom .
like i was kind of being constricted in my own body is probably the only way i could describe it .
my cat jumped up on the bed like she does every night for a few mins of pets and cuddles and i did n't want to even touch her which really started to freak me the hell out .
i jumped out of bed and just started walking around my apartment which made my gf get up and ask if i was ok. told her no i felt weird but not sure what 's going on .
i 'd had panic/anxiety attacks before but this felt ... different .
i felt like i did n't really want to be in my body or that i was n't in my body or something i really do n't know .
i eventually described it to her as i felt like what i 'd imagine it would feel like to lose your grip on reality .
i was somewhat familiar with the idea of depersonalization which i figured it was but did n't want to actually say it bc it terrified me .
i seriously thought this is it i 'm going insane .
i 'm gon na have to check into a hospital for awhile or something which terrified me even more .
eventually my gf and i sat with me on the couch while we watched tv and talked .
my dog came out after a few more mins and even petting her did n't help which freaked me out even more .
after talking about for a bit i calmed down enough to look up symptoms of a panic attack .
sure enough i saw depersonalization was a somewhat common symptom of panic attacks which helped me calm down even more .
i 'm typing this as she 's asleep on the couch next to me and i want to go to bed but i 'm also kinda scared it 's going to happen again .
i know it likely wo n't at least not tonight but it was scary enough to keep me up .
i kinda feel like i 'm rambling at this point but my brain is still kinda foggy as i 'm coming down from all of this .
after searching depersonalization on here and seeing all the posts i wanted to make my own .
i 'm hoping based on some of the posts i 've seen here that it will go away but i 'm wondering if anyone has had this continue on indefinitely .
i do n't like using medication but if this is something i have to deal with for the rest of my life i do n't see another way to deal with it .
i can handle the anxiety attacks i 've had before but this ... this was another level of mind fuck i was not prepared for .
i 'll tell ya what after all of my previous failed attempts to quit this is definitely the thing that will make me never go back again .
please someone let me know if there 's anything i can do to minimize the chances of this happening .
idk if it 's just me but like 10 min ago i was just trippen about myself .
iguess you can say i 'm the type to put labels on shit like oh the cool friend the skater the smoker etc shit like that .
and idk but i 've always been the type of person that anywhere and with whoever i just have the same thought stfu and stop acting like someone you 're not just so that people like you .
tbfh idk what kind of person i am just bc i can act like someone who i 'm not .
i really do n't know who i truly am .
i 'm always stuck in my thoughts w the same shit .
i know they should n't be any labels on anything but i was raised in such a fucked up family and my mindset it pretty fucked up .
sometimes i wan na go tru ego death so my ego and fucken die bc man i truly do hate myself so much .
i always thought that my negative thoughts went away but they where always still there .
it kills me to say but i really just wan na be dead and stop suffering the same old shit .
i 've been dealing w this shit since i was little .
i always wanted to become someone i will never become and i still go tru it .
i 've done acid once and i thought i changed after two weeks but it has been a year but idk .
i have a super famicom that i bought recently and i 'd like to know the chance of it being a 1chip .
i know the easiest way to know is to open it up but i dont have those tools .
i have the serial number and have found that there are many sfcs with serial numbers close to mine that are 1chips .
i hate when somebody posts a pic of their hunt and they get spammed with ewww you do n't deserve to live '' .
same when somebody posts the big fish they 've just caught .
hunting and fishing is something essential people have been doing it since humanity .
the freshly packed meat you see on the supermarket the animals have died in worse ways to get that meat you just do n't see the process .
so people stop being bitchy when someone posts a pic of their hunt/caught fish .
is there a way to simulate a keypress of a media key using presskey ?
appendix a does n't list a scancode/keyname for these keys .
i want to play as a celeb who is very kinky behind closed doors but in public appears very moderate and vanilla with a personality to make you think doggy is the kinkiest thing she does .
but then she has a serious wardrobe malfunction/slip up and now everyone knows her secrets .
so instead of continuing to try hide she leans into it making her fucked up kinks part of her public image using her social media power to make that a popular thing to do .
my biggest kinks include extreme insertions watersports public play forced/public orgasms squirting anal and more .
my only limits are scat gore feet and vomit .
other than that i 'm open to pretty much anything .
if this interests you send me a message and let me know who you 'd like me to play as for this .
i would love to see that as that would give the new game a different feel .
it 's like all the past ones from fnaf have a style of some '80s game .
i like it but i do n't l o v e

the halving event itself and the weeks or months around it may be ‘priced in ' by those who currently know about it ... but new retail investors buying btc several months from now during a bull run can not be priced in .
you 're right but forcing things a lot really ... almost every story ends with the hero returning home so every story has a backtracking story from the way your putting it .
the complaint about dmc4 is how you literally play the same levels again and not about the narrative returning to where it started .
it 's even the same bosses in the same arena .
in most cases when this happens devs try to do it in a clever way so it 's not so obvious ... basically they wan na reuse assets to create more game content but not in a way that makes it too repetitive hence why you face bosses 3x in dmc1 and even 4x if nightmare swallows you but each times it 's in a different location and the boss changes slightly with more moves etc .
problem with dmc4 is that it was rushed so it 's literally the same thing twice ... you 're beating the game twice in 1 playthru .
i have n't done a s+s hawke but s+s in 2 in general is very powerful but not the most exciting .

if a house was on fire and you could see the owner face down on the floor inside could you force entry without their consent to save them or do they burn ?
if you literally physically can not force that barrier without an invite then the answer to where the blood is going is magic .
if you could breech the door put a camera in your bedroom you may be sleepwalking and doing something with the old blood .

i 'm firmly of the opinion that a question like how are you '' should not be rhetorical .
they 've been by far the most valuable part of my training journey .
i hang my gymnastic rings from a pull-up bar and i use my suspension trainers at the top of a doorway .

you can get a lot of mileage from that 36lbs bell though .

the solution would be to just give out a remote raid pass each day and spawn more t1-t3s .

do you have a bank or a credit union ?
most dealerships will use cudl credit union direct lending .
some of the newer dealerships will have special financing or 0 percent for a period of time .
it does n't hurt to have an idea of what percentages are available around .
what makes you think that post is n't from haitch himself ?

we knew each other for 15 years before we got together .
i did n't know what i wanted it took me years to figure that out and when i did i found him .
he 's the sweetest guy i have ever met .
i never wanted to get married my parents marriage failed one of my siblings is married and they are swingers so they completely took away what a marriage actually means or maybe what a marriage means to me but either way i married him cause we both wanted the same things in life and i could n't see me without him .
long story longer in the 15 years we 've known each other he never asked me out he did n't think he was worthy of me and back then i knew i would have broken his heart because i did n't know what i wanted .
if i could go back in time i would tell myself go for that guy sure he 's shy but he 's sweet and loving and would do anything for you .
some people are worth waiting for as tom petty says the waiting is the hardest part .
david looked like morpheus on the way to find neo .
you can add the same template again and it would still be true
it 's true center production has gone down but your statistics do n't back it up correctly .
the league was racist as hell and so was voting .
russell was once left off the all-nba 1st team and they did n't bother to vote a center in .
also the league was smaller team wise then so russell in theory would have better odds of making an all-star team and that makes deandre 's all-star selection more impressive actually .
having owned two d1s and helped my sister through her d1 ownership that 's very optimistic of you .
you need to assume it 'll need more than oil changes as time goes on .
after running a lap with tsukuyomi you are able to know the exact cards that are going to turn up .

in college my friend worked at the lgs and i would drop by when he was working to talk and we had a guy who claimed to have a massive collection of obscure c r guns as in 100 guns that he clearly did n't own .
he was talking about how the 45-70 is the pinnacle of ballistics .
lower hair with the beard would probably be the best combo i think .
i mean it is a sign language why make one if you already have another ?
idk which came first but you 'd still use from one and another
the first cd set i ever bought for myself was mellon collie and the infinite sadness by the smashing pumpkins when i was about 12 .
i listened to that album so much that the cd player i had at the time 's laser went out and i had to get a new one .
i 've listened to a lot of different music in many genres since then but for some reason that album could take me to other worlds when i listened to it .
the rage ennui adoration and frustration of an early teen were perfectly captured .
i might not have understood some of the phrases and words but i definitely understood the emotion .
i still hold many albums i listen to today to the standard of the one that started me down the rabbit hole .
but this is roughly analogous to saying that it was the man being punched in the head who decided that being punched was actually a bad thing when he decided to try and evade the punches .
only if you think that being a stay at home mom is analogous to being punched in the head .
which it clearly is n't because lots of women still choose that role .
from the other side lots of men are miserable at their shitty jobs that women are n't lining up to take over .
that 's not even counting the even worse industrial revolution era jobs men did like factory work with zero safety measures coal mining ...
it 's not oppression of either gender it 's each person taking on a share of the burden of life .
my point is that it 's a feminist perspective that gender-based division of labor is deliberate oppression of women .
there 's nothing bad or shameful about either traditional role .
nobody is devaluing it except the feminists who say you 're not a complete woman if you do n't also have a career .
in fact women 's happiness has been on a steady decline since they entered the job market .
because jobs outside the home are n't fun either .
feminists always want the high paying jobs and more women ceos .
that 's not a realistic view of the world .
most men are n't ceos and we do n't go to work for our amusement .
the gender lifespan gap exists in large part because men die at work .
particularly where those roles were totally divorced from any real difference between men and women .
traditional gender roles are very much based on real differences between men and women .
gender roles and gender dimorphism are everywhere in nature especially among mammals .
does n't mean you 're stuck in your assigned gender role .
but they do exist for both historical and biological reasons .
if you let individuals make their free and informed choice most of them will settle into something typical of their gender role .
feminism used to be about freedom of choice too .
i looked at google and it said the early signs of pregnancy and it said constipation gassiness and flatulence and her description matched it so i was concerned and i was like oh shit if she finds out im gon na die and be buried the same day

sky is a great game and all but it steals the spotlight far too much from the other games .
honestly the subreddit should just be renamed to have the game in its name .
at least with dx that 's now taken the spotlight .
i love sky and all but i really wan na see discussion and love for the other games too .
i 'd love to be able to play a consistent little cut with my irons but ca n't seem to shake my draw .

anytime i get on a horse it flys all across the map with me on it .
i also played the first three originally on ps3 and knight on ps4 .
since then i 've built a pc and have replayed them on there .
it was a lot better than playing the return to arkham versions because of the higher framerates and it retained the original ambiance that the remaster sacrificed .
still i have a lot of childhood memories playing them on ps3 .
i hope you enjoy them as much as many of us in the community have
the last few years my mom was like that too .
i 'm glad i was able to provide that for you

you 've already dropped your assessed price by 10 k. within minutes .
alright boys let 's get these bombs loaded onto the drones .
it has more to do with the fact that most of the shepherds are orphans because of vards .
for thousands of years vards remained very secluded on their island chain south of the continent .
then about a century ago they began an aggressive push to colonize the continent .
enslaving and killing most of the populations they conquer .
most of the coast along the southern and eastern side of the continent is now under their control .
word from traders have even said that the far off continents to the east and west have seen attacks from vards .
the sad reality is we are not improving this has been going on for ages ! !

you do n't have the concept of genocide without him and you dont have the crime without the convention .
i also think that being gifted is n't something you 'have ' just like you do n't 'have ' your height or race .
intelligence just varies naturally and at different thresholds of test scores we give it different names .
i think it 's probably the negatives that we are viewing inappropriately .
i was n't borderline depressed in elementary school because i was so smart it was because our education system is n't build for the variance in intelligence that exists and the adults around me were n't properly educated about what a child like me needed among other things .
so i should n't curse my diagnosis for it .
if on pc i can take you along to some raids .
fat32 can support up to 2tb but you can only format up to a 32gb partition to it using the built in windows format tool .
that 's a backwards compatibility thing that microsoft still on even on windows 10 .
you have to use something like guiformat to format larger partitions .
yes i appreciate the effort and attitude behind this post but the executions is certainly flawed .

gaining leg muscles will increase capacity for them to move you faster during sprints but only to a certain point .
additionally adding whatever weight to your body will possibly slow you down .
but unless you want to excel in sprinting there is nothing to worry about .
you still can be very fast with a lot of musculature .
besides just looking at sprinters they certainly are n't small .

things like silver arrows should have to be purchased and manage but it 's so pointless to have regular arrows have a cost and limit .
they are so cheap that the only time you wo n't have them is when you happen to forget to bring them .
not to mention most ranged bad guys carry them so you probably would n't even need to buy them in the first place .
i think your idea of having a quiver is good but make that quiver never run out of normal arrows .
that way it still adds weight and makes sense . ''
as far as dos2 goes you can put your arrows on your hot bar then stick them in a backpack if you want to keep your inventory clean .
to be fair cyber stein was n't especially good even with it .
dark world ftk is still fairly consistent with it and thankfully they hit de-syncro which was cyber stein but better when coupled with fortune lady water .

not going to defend valorant at all but there is a reason after 20 years of map design and development that the maps cs has and had are extremely popular .

es6 is likely about 4 or 5 years away i would be surprised/disappointed in everyone including myself if bs is n't done in that timeframe .

i 'm not asking why he did n't heal padme i 'm talking about his turn to the dark side he only joins the dark side because he thinks that it is the only way to learn how to heal if there was a way to heal without turning to the dark side he would have helped windu kill palpatine

the issue is that the mortality rate of the black death was extremely high with a lower population .
my point was that with how interconnected our world is the body count would be enormous even with low death rates .
the virus is n't the dangerous part of the outbreak .
any other disease reaching this far this fast would be dozens of times worse the scenario i put out was one where ever human on earth got the disease and were untreated .
my point was that the virus had the potential to be worse than those outbreaks if ignored .
the ridiculous number of conditions that would need to be met for that scenario makes that scenario litteraly impossible is anybody anywhere had half a brain .
my other point is that for this virus to have the same death count of the black death one that killed roughly 40 of the world population covid-19 would need to infect 7,800,000,000 people and be untreated .
even the black death did n't have that high of infection rates .
also nothing in my post mentioned that i was american you half wit .

it depends very heavily on what brand of powersupply .
obviously 500w of name brand high quality supply is worth 650w of el cheapo thermaltake for example .
also a good quality supply can be run up to within 20 or 30 watts of it 's maximum rating under load and still keep all the rails within specification where as a lower quality unit will often deviate enough from rail voltages to cause instability well below the rating .
a 2070 super is rated at 215w a 3600x or 3700x at 65w more .
even allowing 100w for everything else which would be unlikely you would still have a margin with a once again decent psu .
so i took steps to get my waves out more about half a year ago but am only starting to get serious about it about a week ago .
i co-wash about every 3 days with shea moisture curl and shine condition applying gradually to thoroughly get my hair .
only recently starting to finger curl it lightly with conditioner on not sure if it works yet .
want to look into anything worth trying to fully enhance the waves/curls i have the potential of having .
you know i 'm such crap at the game that i wo n't even do a timed one .
i e got probably 30-ish hours in maybe but i wo n't do one and it 's probably costing me but right now i do n't even much care .
i almost sound like i 'm self-promoting myself i 'm not .
but what i do is have a theme every week and tell all my friends who are from reddit when i was in the friend chain thing .
this week is rainbow week just me getting rid of some stuff that is in color order does that make sense ?
i wish i found more people who did this because i find friends who sell the same thing over and over ... nobody really needs it anymore !
this is so not apropos but seeing tobias ' d*ck in s1 did absolutely nothing for me .
i liked how you kept a consistent theme with the spikes platforms and sawblades .
i do however agree with the others that it would n't hurt to spice things up with some decoration !
just throwing a semi solid in every once in a while or adding a ceiling to a section can do wonders for a level 's visuals .
as for platforming you could add height to the ground to make players climb platforms up while dodging sawblades .
you could add floating or falling platforms to mix up where the player lands .
as the level stands it has a consistent theme and some fun jumps but a little variety might help boost this level 's success !
overall it was still a fun level to play through

this is the first real relationship i have ever had and i 've been dating my girlfriend for around 6 months now .
i 've been super happy with this relationship and i seriously think i 'm in a dream yes i know corny lol .
without dragging on this post i found out that she has had past relationships with both men and women and it kind of threw me in a loop .
for some context i found this out a month into a our relationship and while i like to think i do n't care about her past and try to focus on the here and now type thing there are times the fact that she 's dated other women always goes through my head and makes me uncomfortable and worried .
i 've actually talked to her about how i feel and it feels great to get it off my chest but i always keep on getting little episodes of either jealousy or just general anxiety .
i know this is mainly a me problem and i 'm trying to work on it because i know i love this girl it 's just hard sometimes because it helps when i talk to her about how i feel but i do n't always want to bring it up to her because i feel as if she 'll get frustrated or even mad at the fact that i ca n't get over it .
what are ya thoughts do i just need to work this out myself and basically get over myself ?

we used to play on publicly hosted servers one of which had a huge number of workshop items which really enriched the experience .

i 've seen and downloaded the sourcebook for rebels and some pdfs that people have developed .
are y'all aware of anything that takes season 7 of clone wars the latest from the films or keeping up with the comics ?
i 'm not exactly sure what has actually changed in the source materials that would need updating but i 'm curious about ongoing developments in my fave star wars rpg .
my question is for recruiters and those seeking jobs .
what 's been your favorite candidate or recruiter experience ?
so when farming metal should you max the loot slider or save the frags for 1 zone or something ?
i listened to them when i was around 9 years old once .
now i do n't remember anything but the fact that they had this one song that was a real banger that 9yo me liked .
there was like a group of friends in the front of the cover .
you could see the ground bellow it was green .
in the left there was a skinny elf dude with a bow a guy with a sword slicing a purple humanoid monster in the right at the back left there was this dude that looked like blanca from street fighter and a dude with boxing gloves punching some monster with a gun at the back left ?
i think there was a flying eyeball monster at the far left ?
and i think there was a bigass tree in the distance ?
i first saw them from youtube and i forgot everything about them except the album cover .
i have a fresh libreelec kodi image installed on a rpi4 .
i watched one show on seren than it stopped finding sources .
i have cleared the cache reinstalled a4kscrapers and finally did a complete reimage of the drive to librelec and reinstalled only seren addon .
i have my real debrid account enabled and still can not find any sources .
my vpn is connecting to a low traffic node and my connection is fast .
is anyone else having an issue with this addon or source pack ?
any ideas i am not doing to get it to work ?
i have also switched my real debrid from cdn to cloudflare .
a place for members of r/commenttogetkarma to chat with each other
it 's genuinely a blur but i remember it being a story in passing and it unsettled me .
there was something scary about the cow maybe possessed or something ?
i truly ca n't remember i just know it scared me .
i randomly came across it last season and i loved getting a fresh behind the scenes look about songwriters and how the process actually happens .
its also different from just singing competitions and shows a great perspective for singers/songwriters who want to get into the music industry .
im just trying to sell some stuff at nooks but it 's 1am est so mine is closed .
my sibling likes to have all these crazy adventures mountain biking rock climbing backcountry snowboarding crazy camping trips where you have to canoe for hours to get to the location ect ect they always have interesting stories and photos to share .
i feel like ashamed that my life seems boring compared to them .
i like to paint read and make crafts and go to local events and music shows .
sometimes i feel lame and like i should try to do more interesting stuff like my sibling .
but i just have no desire for those high risk type of activities plus i 'm not really very athletic of a person .
i like to go on a hike here and there maybe rent a paddleboard or kayak once a year or go camping at a campground .
but i 'm just not that kind of adventurous risk taking person .
i kind of wish i was but i 'm just not .
i would rather just walk around in a forest and look at all the beautiful plants and trees and just be one with nature .
or sit on the beach and watch the sunset .
i guess this was just me venting my feelings more than anything else .
i was on tiktok and heard a lot about this and researched it for like 3 hours .
so i took my boyfriend who thought it was dumb nonsense .
i on the other hand set the intent to find art and was looking for some kind of sign for myself or maybe something about my future because i have been feeling a little lost lately .
the first was 3 minutes away down a road i take frequently to the grocery store but it had me turn somewhere i 've always been curious about .
we ended up in a fancy housing area and i found some sidewalk chalk art that made me think about my intention .
the second place was also right next to our house .
we went down this street which ended up being a long road of some beautifully unique houses .
the destination was someone 's house so we did n't get to go but i also saw a rabbit which i think is significant to randonauts ?
lastly our 3rd trip took us to the outskirts of our town where we went down another really long country road with big beautiful homes .
i also saw a mural someone painted on their barn .
more art this last location had me a little creeped out .
although the houses around us were beautiful i felt/feel creeped out thinking about the final destination .
i was n't able to make it to the exact coordinates because i had to walk and somehow get over an electric fence .
later i google mapped the area and it was a government field office .
not sure what i was suppose to take from this adventure but i had fun and definitely want to go again .
what i mean about late bloomer '' is those who started playing the games very late .
most people have started playing pokemon since childhood but that was n't the case for me .
back then my only exposure to pokemon was the anime and my parents were very strict with our expenses so i never got a gameboy or ds .
at first i really do n't get the appeal of the games found it boring at first mainly because i was mostly playing racing games gta at the time .
it was only in high school where i started to take interest after seeing my classmates playing the gba games in an emulator on their phones .
i decided to give it a shot and downloaded an emulator .
i picked emerald as my first game because it 's the generation i 'm most familiar with thanks to the anime .
i picked mudkip as my starter and the rest was history .
i started to understand the appeal these games had .
and now i 'm proud to say i 'm a pokemon fan .
i 'm really curious to see if there are any others that also started late on pokemon games .

song of the storyteller full round/3 ap on first turn major action/2 ap per target on consecutive turns
reed is able to focus his semblance through his voice empowering his words with strengthening effects .
when channeling his semblance reed 's silver aura mists around him like clouds .
golden bar lines with notes on them manifest around him his words traveling to where he focuses his semblance .
as he channels his semblance it grows stronger enhancing his allies .
on the first turn reed focuses his song on semblance/2 allies giving them presence/2 to attacks .
on the third turn reed 's semblance grows stronger his words resounding with his audience hardening their spirits adding presence/2 to defense .
on the fifth turn reed 's words gain a healing effect healing allies for presence/3 at the end of each turn .
he is slimmer than most not to say he is n't strong .
years of farm work and training created a lean figure and years of practice on various instruments make his forearms unproportionally large but not significantly .
he has a small face with shaggy medium length brown hair with black and grey spots in it .
his large blue eyes have an undeniable sadness deep in them but it seems comfortable and accepted .
round glasses sit on an upturned nose giving him a youthful appearance .
reed 's outfit is rather simple with minor details showing personality .
basic brown leather work boots stained with mud and dirt from his time in the fields rest on his feet with a pair of tan high waisted pants tucking into the ends of the boots .
two shiny brass buttons sit on both sides of the waistband a pair of brown suspenders holding his pants up .
a green stone sitting in a brass wire wrapping hangs from a chain next to a red cylindrically shaped flower .
a simple gold ring sits on his left hand a silver with a typically shaped flower sits on the ring finger of his right hand next to a black ring with a white stone the size of a dime on it .
reed 's voice is his truly defining feature the easiest way to describe it is that of a prophet .
there is a musiciality and lightness to it even when speaking to someone and an electrifying passion that carries his words as if they are willing themselves to be heard .
it 's pitched a little higher than you would expect but is not child-like in any way instead full of maturity and experience .
when singing his voice is extraordinary having a depth and fluidity that can only be described as having multiple voices that are able to harmonize with each other .
eurydice is reed 's guitar that was given to him as a child and he has been playing for most of his life .
the instrument is like a limb to him he is entirely familiar with it and knows exactly the noise that the guitar will make no matter where he touches it .
the instrument is a wooden acoustic guitar with a white wood grain finish giving it an elegance .
he usually carries it with him all the time a simple brown leather strap keeping the instrument slung over his shoulder comfortably .
when modifying the weapon with his grandparents reed chose not give his weapon a melee form instead trusting in his semblance and musical ability to defend himself .
reed grew up in the town of piera a small farming settlement in the southern central section of sanus .
from the moment he was born music was a part of his life .
his mother lyra sang him songs nightly lulling him into a deep sleep and often beyond .
music was a part of the soul of this family and was always present in their humble home whether an off-hand tune whistled lyra whistled as she worked around the house her parent 's favorite music playing from the stereo or her father callous playing the guitar after dinner while lyra sang .
it did n't take long for reed to develop his own voice and join in creating a music of his own .
despite the noises starting as gurgles and gargles there was a certain musicality of reed 's voice that made the nonsense sound oddly beautiful .
lyra had a deep knowledge of music and understood it as a language the same way she understood the language that she spoke and read .
it had also been a part of her life from a very early point and she grew up the same way that reed would grow up .
it started on piano at five and quickly developed into expertise picking up the guitar along the way quickly mastering it .
had two things been different in lyra 's life she would have been a professional musician changing the world with her messages .
her family was not poor but they lived in piera which was not close to vale so they were n't rich .
she just did n't have the ability to put her music into the world and get noticed but the other thing was that she really did n't care about being famous .
it was n't that she did n't want people to hear her music but there was a certain authenticity that she had t and the way her smile captured a crowd could n't translate to a recorded format and that was fine with her .
her musical skill developed the way that she wanted it to and she explored letting her own abstract style guide her to other instruments and sounds .
her audience never extended beyond the town and the occasional traveler but everyone who watched her perform would agree that there was something that made her better than the rest .
reed 's father callous grew up in very different circumstances from lyra .
his parents were both successful hunters that had survived the years and decided to start a family .
callous was the only child the couple would have and his parents devoted everything to him .
he was their world and nothing would come before him however they were aware of the dangers of the world and would train their son to be able to survive regardless of whether or not he would choose to be a hunter .
callous idolized his parents and wanted to be so much like them but he found that his natural calling was n't with a blade or a gun but a pencil .
unlike his parents callous had an incredible grasp of language .
even from a young age callous wrote poetry short stories and sections of novels that would never get finished .
he decided that rather than continue his parent 's legacy of defending the world from the grimm he would travel the world and tell the stories of those on the world 's edges .
he travelled around remnant collecting stories from all different cultures and groups and compiled them into his first non-fiction work stories of the people one remnant .
this compilation received international acclaim and skyrocketed his reputation at the age of 26 .
after writing several more novels and poetry books callous set off to create a sequel to his breakthrough story set .
in his travels he found the small town of piera and quickly fell in love with lyra .
after finishing his travels and collecting stories he retired back to piera to marry lyra and have reed music becoming an integral part of his life .
piera was one of those towns where everyone knew each other and people rarely came and went .
families had deep roots in the town that went back generations and there was a sense of community that brought the town together .
one of these families was the perennial family who lived several houses away the florists of the settlement responsible for growing their flowers .
their daughter hyacinth and reed were born around the same time and became instant friends .
their families were already close and the two became inseparable as soon as they could walk .
by the time reed was seven his voice started to change .
his already beautiful voice started to have this otherworldly quality to it when he would sing .
lost legends told of a gift from the gods blessing someone with a voice beautiful enough to will the earth to move or the trees to grow fruit .
the gift was a relic from the days stories were committed to memory and recited in sung verse however as the ancient tradition lost its significance so did the power of the storyteller .
reed a product of a master musician and an ingenious author had the means and the ability to continue the storyteller legacy .
its power was exponentially smaller than those before him only allowing him to help flowers grow or make the sun shine feel a little stronger .
reed would sing to the birds and they would sing back or the wheat harvest would grow a little taller as he sang to them throughout the season or those listening to him would suddenly feel stronger or more empowered .
with this lyra had decided that it was finally time to pass her legacy on as well .
she gifted him the guitar that she picked up during her life and learned to play knowing that he would carry it on and create more music with it and spread music to others .
as they grew older their friendship began to change .
reed would notice the way hyacinth 's smile curled up on one side and not the other she would notice the way reed 's hair would fall just over his eyes and the way his fingers moved across the guitar .
it would only ever be a quick look their eyes darting away in an attempt to avoid notice .
at 13 they would hold hands for the first time they went on their first date at 14 kissed for the first time at 15 and their friendship started to turn into love for each other .
at 17 reed 's seemingly perfect life was changed forever .
hyacinth as well as a few other members of the village were sick and the medicine that they had available was n't working .
very quickly it was determined that this disease would be fatal if not treated and there was n't much time .
willing to risk everything for his love reed volunteered to travel to vale to get medicine and come back although time was short and the sick 's condition was getting worse day-by-day .
reed left the next morning with his guitar a pack and a horse desperate to make it back in time to save hyacinth .
towards the end of his first day reed stopped in the slightly larger town of colchis where he met a hunter named argo who was also travelling to vale .
after explaining the situation to argo they decided to travel together .
over the next week argo would explain that he believed that the primary mission of hunters should not be to fight off the grimm but to work towards uniting the peoples of remnant and facilitate true world peace .
the combating of grimm was a part of society and necessary but ultimately argo thought that it was a distraction from bringing the people together and that as a hunter he chose to travel across the continents from town to town helping people on the individual and community level .
upon reaching vale reed explained the situation and with confirmation from argo reed was given the needed medicine and a speedy ride back to piera in a bullhead .
arriving back at the village reed found hyacinth alive but very very sick .
her body was starting to fail her and while the medicine might help she had been fighting to live until reed returned so that she could see him one last time .
hyacinth passed away that night reed staying by her side until the next morning .
with his heart eternally broken reed struggled with pretty much everything .
he had lost the thing he held most important and did n't know what to do with his life .
it took time but reed eventually thought back to his time with argo .
the ideals and messages had resonated with the boy and still having found no new purpose he spoke with his father about the world of huntsman and huntresses and what his training was like as a child .
speaking directly to callous 's parents reed became more open to the idea of becoming a huntsman with argo 's peaceful and community focused ideals guiding him through his training .
unlike callous combat school was something that reed wanted to specialize in even though combat was n't his focus .
working with his grandparents he modified his mother 's guitar into a weapon that could turn his music into a weapon allowing him to actually fight with it .
training with his grandparents reed quickly discovered he was not as proficient with a spear as he was with music and struggled to make strides that would allow him to apply to beacon when he turned 18 .
despite feeling unprepared he applied anyways and was turned down .
not letting this defeat crush him he thought of hyacinth and pushed on training harder the next year .
seeing significant strides and gains not only in his combat but also aura and semblance reed once again applied to beacon .
using his new skills and knowledge reed was accepted into the program as a huntsman .
looking forward to his training reed hungers to bring good into the world and help people beyond the threat of the grimm seeking to bring humanity and faunus together as one race without conflict .
sadness is the primary emotion that drives reed although not in a negative way .
it is something that he has lived with and accepted his love for hyacinth allowing him to motivate him to make the world better and to help others because it 's what he knows she would want him to do .
the memory of hyacinth is a part of his everyday life having taken articles of her clothing and her jewelry and worked them into his own wardrobe .
reed 's motivation as a huntsman comes from his brief time with argo traveling to vale .
as a huntsman reed does not want to be on the front lines fighting grimm and does not seek the fame and fortune that comes with the name of huntsman .
instead reed strives to create a difference on a small scale hoping to bring the world together through meaningful action .
inspired by his father and argo reed hopes to travel the continents as a huntsman helping communities and facilitate peace .
in his everyday life reed seeks to make the best of every moment possible .
having first-hand knowledge of how short life can be he strives to make those around him hopeful and happy through his performances .
despite only being 19 reed carries himself with a maturity and focus that comes from having his priorities clear and knowing exactly what he wants .

i 'm such a lucky man to get teamed up with you .
heyo i 'm looking for someone to vc and play survival or creative and just chill !
i 'm not sure how long i 'll play because it 's currently 1:00 in the morning here..
i use discord and i 'm 16 and a girl !
message me or comment with a little about yourself and what you 're into
so to start i 'm a virgin male and i 'm definitely not gay .
i 've only ever found women attractive and although i do n't have a problem with other people doing it i 'm frankly disgusted by the prospect of having sex with another male .
but nearly each time i 've done psychedelics they 've fucked with my head about sexuality .
my first time on lsd the lighting was pretty bad and i remember hallucinating that one of my friends was giving a blowjob to another one .
i might 've been in a thoughtloop and been hallucinating that for 30 minutes to an hour without saying anything .
i remember he was talking about neurons but the word neuron evoked imagery of penises in my head .
after a while though i broke out of it and the comedown was great and i was chillin with the boys talking about interesting shit .
second acid trip i 'm with a female friend of mine .
we 're just friends and have been for a while and the lack of attraction is mutual .
this trip overall is pretty good but i regularly feel like there 's a language subtext or subliminal conversation that is going on between us that is implicitly sexual the prospect of this gave me a bit of anxiety .
anyways we meet up with some other friends afterwards on the comedown and they mention as a joke that we had sex because we 're doing drugs together .
for some reason this elicits like a really strong disgust response in me and for the next few hours i ca n't help but feel extremely disgusted by human sexual activity in general .
this trip did n't necessarily have anything gay but thought i should mention
my first shrooms trip is probably where it was weirdest .
i was at home with my dad who knew i was tripping and is fine with it and i hear him talking on the phone in the other room .
he says something that looking back i have no idea whether it was sexual or not but amounted to a joke about a woman moaning .
while i peaked on the shrooms trip i was in bed and listening to music aloud with my phone at my side .
my dad comes into my room a bit after the peak and looks at my phone and for a split second i suspects he thinks i 'm watching porn which weirds me out .
he also then asks me something about where some cup is which seemed completely out of the blue to me and made me suspect he thought that i had jacked off while tripping and jizzed into a cup ?
throughout the comedown i get messages from my friends who are mostly guys .
the same thing from the second trip happens where i suspect sexual subtext in some of their messages .
for some reason i think i subconsciously start fearing that i 'm gay because i have mostly male friends .
there 's a few minutes where i 'm sorta in a thoughtloop trying to convince myself and thought about convincing my dad that i 'm not gay .
again no hate towards gay people it honestly might just be an insecurity of mine because i 'm yet to have a girlfriend .
any thoughts on why my mind often jumps to sexuality while tripping though ?
i personally do n't feel like i 'm missing out on too much by still being a virgin and i 'm fine waiting till the right woman comes along .
so i 'm not sure why so much anxiety keeps bubbling up about this when i trip .
tldr my trips give me anxiety about my sexuality in general and elicit an uncertainty about whether i 'm straight
is it relevant in the current pve sandbox or does one two punch out class it ?
not like raids but just general like strike and lower level nightfall activities .
what is you guys ' opinion on the spray dye prints ?
i 've been looking at a couple pairs of leggings on poshmark with them but it 's hard for me to judge because i have n't really seen pictures of anyone with them .
just wanted to get a few opinions on what anyone thought of them !
if you have any fit pics with them please feel free to drop
we met in discord and are actually doing a stream together .
my girlfriend has recently been having suicidal thoughts and she is overly stressed with schoolwork .
i feel as though she is in desperate need of prayer .
she herself is not orthodox if that influences your prayers in any way .
i think i might end with an 89 for the semester looking at how my projected '' avg is on the portal and it currently says a '' but that obv can change with the final .
does anybody know the minimum average for an a this class usually ?
my ta also forwarded me grading details of previous years and exam averages this semester are actually lower than that of previous semesters .
i 'm guessing based on that the minimum grade for an a should be even lower ?
last couple days been getting a pain that 's similar to the feeling of having food poisoning a few times an hour like twice a day .
no idea what the hell is going on i do have an apt tomorrow though over the phone
long time no see years ago i built this computer using advice from many of you and i thank you for that overall it 's been a great experience and reddit has always come through .
i apologize for the long post but this issue is going to be something i have to explain in detail because its been a chain of events that i believe may lead to some sort of hardware failure .
intro aside as i 'm sure you can tell from the title my pc is freezing and crashing .
i 'm pretty sure most of those components have nothing to do with why this is happening but i wanted to list the components in case of any possibilities i have n't thought of .
this issue originally arose when i was playing garry 's mod and streaming on twitch in a discord call and i had a few programs open in the background as well .
heavy load but my computer had handled much more than that in the past .
i got the blue windows screen with the and it froze on that screen i let it sit there for two hours before holding down the power button .
the msi screen would flash on id get the windows loading wheel and the wheel would freeze almost immediately always in the same spot .
after completely disassembling my computer i found no issues and put it back together and made sure everything was seated properly .
no booting still but i could get into my bios !
after updating my bios to the newest version the computer booted and worked fine except in the system page in windows it said ram 32gb 15.9 useable .
every fix i could find on the internet did n't work .
moving down the bios to one version back did work however and now all 32gb is usable .
now though within 10 minutes from boot the computer will either freeze or blue screen .
i 've tried multiple bios versions all with the same result .
my two theories are one/both of my ram sticks are dying or that my motherboard is dying .
i do n't know what to do here and have spent weeks trying to get my computer back to normal .
i apologize for formatting on mobile as i ca n't particularly post from my computer
so while i was so sad at the originals ending wanting at least 1 of the brothers to survive for hopes sake given how they ended it with elijah and klaus going out together i think tvd should have had a similar ending .
the parallels between the brothers one looking for the humanity/redemption in the other more villiany brother should have mirrored in the ending .
as elena said stefan needed a good damon more than he needed her .
just like elijah spent 1000 years trying to redeem klaus 's atrocities and get him to care about something other than himself .
i dont think tvd giving damon this happily ever after human life with elena was believable .

the whole message of the show is kill yourself and suddenly everyone will listen to understand you .
also it 's the perfect revenge against those who 've wronged you !
if this were satirical a dark comedy that would be one thing .
but the show unironically promotes suicide as a method of solving your complicated teenage issues .
what a great message for hormonal minors to consume .
does this mean all the character profiles for this particular character is done or is it something else
i think the last time it was posted someone said he survived but had some injury .
the second to last thing is ever want is a digital nanny .
the last thing is ever want is a middle manager though .
maybe that 's hyperbolic because i just thought about kidney stones and i do n't want those either
ah well only one function to focus on is less work .
focusing on the difference is the natural way to go .
there 's a somewhat standard notation for these things you can read up on here https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_o_notation family_of_bachmann e2 80 93landau_notations but note conventions differ slightly so you should be aware of the convention in your field if any .
lim f x x 1 is equivalent to saying f x x o x .
lim f x x 0 is equivalent to saying f x x o 1 .
you can also make weaker statements like f x x o sqrt x or stronger statements like f x x o 1 x .
this is all just language for giving asymptotics for f x x but useful language .

obama sold black people to white men when slavery was a thing .
i 've poked around in there and i think that 's where i actually got my glass one
the amount of trauma we would have would make us want to stay dead .
there 's also a large chance people if they could choose to stay dead would largely make that choice
it 's hard for me to look past those annoying teenage vampires !

if you are using a gpu you are n't mining bitcoin .
you are mining other cryptos and nicehash automatically converts that to bitcoin .
i wo n't be going to anything for the remainder of the year .
i wonder if there could have been a great b w picture here if you had stood just a few feet to the left looking just a few degrees clockwise all else like contrast lighting etc equal .
as other 's have noted this image does not seem to take much advantage of the medium .
the strongest element is the section of the ikuta road arch against the bright white building in the background but it 'feels ' just a bit too far off to the side .
a slight shift of perspective should allow this relationship to be more celebrated and provide stronger resolution for leading lines .
and i bet it could be done without substantially changing the size or position of the arch in the frame .
the compression field of view scale and human presence limited but very much there make this feel more like an intimate nook in a bigger city .
juxtaposition '' is n't a matter of showing something different or even different than what you expect to see .
juxtaposition is specifically putting disparate elements together so that their differences are highlighted .
showing this street empty is not a juxtaposition there is no bustling state being juxtaposed to it .
for instance placing this image on an easel in the middle of this street during its busiest hours that would be a juxtaposition .
there is some irony here as juxtaposition of light and shadow is one of those things that lends itself to black and white photography one of the reasons someone might choose b w over color for a particular scene .
but words about telegram 's strong encryption spread and continued to attract interests and then the scandal happened .
my mom would n't allo any decoration when i was a kid .
she said it was becuase the wall would get ruined .
nowadays any walls with stuff on them is so weird to me .
she also did n't allow us to slam doors saying only thugs did that or say stupid or shut up .
same with friends or sleepovers she did n't allow em becuase she said the adults would turn into pedos or something
the kext are out of date and virtualsmc fakesmc plus they do n't give credit and multibeast is proprietary .
a picture by picture bionicle robot battle made by some kid with windows movie maker and played linkin park under it .
i just kind of assumed it was something she black mailed away from the guy in episode 1 .
yes i know but i 'm not only talking about brawlers with low health relative to other brawlers .
i mean all brawlers have low health relative to the general damage output of all brawlers .
look at other mobas where fights are generally longer because their characters ' health is higher compared to their damage whereas in brawl stars the ratio is a lot smaller .
tbh i 'd much rather see dunston 's ground in than the gis

why spread the disease when it can be contained to the source .
iw needs to get on top of it for sure but until then should protect as many of their paying customers as possible .
reason a lot of people game on console in the first place is to avoid hacker 's .
one of the reasons why i never wanted crossplay in the first place plus fov mouse etc .
much prefer a level playing field settled by skill and not equipment .
depends on where you are that looks like any number of trails we 've got out here in washington though replace redwoods with cedars hemlock and fir .
this would be an absolutely awesome trail between the trees and the you know hills .
destiny 2 is cpu heavy they ca n't run d2 at a consistent 120 .

pulled the empire back out of its slump and reestablished it as a force to be respected .

yeah i actually have since found someone else thankfully !

it 's a big leap to take to assume that because someone opposes violent vigilante justice they sympathize with the guilty party and must relate to them in some way .
i do n't know where this took place but if it happened where i live ... you 'd be defending criminals too .

government aid should only be to maintain the status quo during this emergency .
it is not ment as a profit center for the corporation .
i see you guys saying inc\*l '' a lot and i just wanted to say that it 's not an okay word to say .
in fact it 's very harmful to the asexual community because you all are constantly calling aces inc\*ls '' .
there are people who are actually involuntary celibates because they were n't born attractive or they were born socially awkward .
you guys are demonizing them and judging them shallowly .
they ca n't help that they were born a certain way physically or mentally .
i would want to harm women too if they constantly demonized me or ridiculed me or rejected me .
not everyone can have a good personality or good clothes or a good life .
ive seen verses as short as 2 lines and as long as 16
6 do n't lose sight of the hobbies you enjoyed as a child .
they will help you live as you grow older .
i made the mistake to think it was mature '' to stop following my hobbies anime games and such .
mid-thirty i had become a boring and depressed person and felt isolated as none of my old friends lived close by and with many of them i had grown apart anyway .
then i picked my old hobby up again went outside to go to events etc .
and connected with some great people who i really feel comfortable with to be .
i could have spared myself years of loneliness and sadness if i had done this earlier .
you do n't seem to understand the common sense rule at all lol
the headrest bolt things would n't slide into the holes for the headrest reverse sadly .
and we 're back to head in the sand .
when i say 5e board games '' i am more talking about 5th edition content and board games .
there were some that came out during 4th edition as well .
but there is definitely a focus on the newer ones with regards to idle champions .
basically 5e came out idle champions was born wanted to make use of some content board games and saw that there were some current board games tomb of annihilation for example but also noticed that it 's part of its own product line starting with castle ravenloft which came out during 4e .
it 's the same with the neverwinter mmo coming out the year prior to 5e coming out but we get celeste and makos from it .
i ca n't recall off the top of my head on that one .
basically cne is trying to pull only the more recent stuff into the game and on rare occasions they will throw the occasional bone like melf coming from out of nowhere to placate the older fans .
as for the first 4 evergreen champions bruenor celeste nayeli and jarlaxle bruenor and jarlaxle both come from the biggest forgotten realms book series to exist and continues to exist celeste i believe came from the neverwinter mmo she 's in the intro video to the game and nayeli off the top of my head i ca n't remember .
i ca n't remember if it was from an adventure or board game .
definitely was n't a novel and i doubt a video game .
i do n't like the ideas of women only areas . ''
i want women to have the same respect and status as men in the strength training part of the fitness world and when you treat women differently with different hours '' it does n't give us equal treatment .
i had a go bag when i was 7 thinking back on it now i just want to tell them that they were so brave and i 'm so proud of them .
wappa not as good but still decent and tests 23 percent .
89.7 certainty is n't even that much https youtu.be/dqw4w9wgxcq it 's less https youtu.be/dqw4w9wgxcq than the amount of people https youtu.be/dqw4w9wgxcq that died versus the amount of people https youtu.be/dqw4w9wgxcq that are still https youtu.be/dqw4w9wgxcq alive .
i mean tarkin and tfp are good for fleet fights early on and i know you need them for hoth ds territory battle which is why i plan on using them to get r2 .
imperial troopers though would be another good empire based team .
lembra quando saiu uma pesquisa dizendo que os militares eram a instituição mais confiável do país segundo os brasileiros ?
and china never shares any truth to taiwanese or the rest of the world .
i dont think it is possible for resolume to trigger a clip based just on pixel data from the composition .
trigger is just based on time and clip duration neither of which apply here .
but honestly with a midi device w key set up to the 'trigger next ' function you should be capable of running this live no problem .
unless the ndi spout triggers often this should be smooth enough for goverment work

i thought it was a cat when i looked at it the other day but honestly the image is to blurry for me to say it 's anything other than mushy shadows .
left side on a right diagonal from the end of the 4x was where i thought i saw it underneath that tall bush .
not sure why i had been so certain it was a cat yesterday though .

do you need some help warning up next time ?
house music originated in chicago in the late 80s .
has a four four beat and has been incredibly popular and dominant in the uk club scene becoming acid house music in the late 80s starting the rave scene .
rave music originated in uk illegal warehouse and outdoor parties in late 80s and 90s .
but took on a higher speed bpm and break beat format from acid house .
this evolved into faster bpm music called hardcore in the early 90s .
hardcore then evolved into happy hardcore and jungle drum and bass starting their own genres .
techno evolved alongside all of this in various ways since the 80s in detroit and germany mostly .
edm in my opinion is just a lazy way of bringing a modern day easy to market and understand format for club and rave music of a higher bpm format and differs from dj to dj in terms of what it is .
this my account of having lived through it and listening to electronic music since the 90s .

the ach is being phased out in favor of the ech probably because of it being rifle rated .
i ca n't find stories which mention the ech particularly saving someone getting shot by a rifle at short range but it 's not like those things get published often .
i 'm also sure the us military would n't switch its helmet to something rifle rated unless that rifle rating actually did something in terms of protection .
otherwise they would just keep working on lowering the weight of iiia helmets .

i 'll be honest my favorite part of the quarantine videos is seeing jamón patiently waiting around underfoot for snacks .

they then compare that to how much you pre-paid in taxes the money your employer withheld from your paycheck every month if you pre-paid too much you 'll get a refund for the difference if you paid too little you 'll get a bill .
now it 's true that many people in your situation probably pre-paid a little too much .
for example you may be eligible for a tax deduction based on the length of your commute any expenses you had associated with a move to a new job equipment you bought to do you job or hiring someone to help you around the house and since your employer does n't know about any of these they were n't taken into account when calculating your tax pre-payments .
in this case you 'd get a refund for the difference .
however if you had other sources of income during the year eg you sold some stocks held in another country made money selling on ebay bought and sold bitcoin etc then you also have to include these on your tax return and they are taken into account when determining how much you owe in taxes .
in that case your pre-payments may well have been too low and you 'll get a bill instead .
the second case is comparatively rare for people in your situation and if you had non-trivial side income you were already forced by law to fill out a tax return every year on time but i just wanted to better explain the situation .

this is the most recent literature review as in a review of all currently available studies on aa effectiveness
they found that success rates were literally double that of people who do not attend 12 step programs and that higher attendance correlated with higher rates of abstinence .
there was mixed results on whether those results were specific to aa attendence but the author offers some compelling reasons based on evidence quality why that may not be particularly relevant .
also you said that in your experience proponents dismiss the experience of others who did n't work the program '' but that is literally the entire point that if you do n't actually do all the 12 steps the program does n't work but the literature review does n't take any of that into account it 's just a review of the evidence and it 's not perfect but it is fairly compelling and most definitely does n't indicate anything remotely resembling your claim that empirical studies show that success rates are abysmal '' .
the documentary premise is to get their real story and reactions to being fired before they know they 're going to be in a george clooney movie .

at the very least get her to admit that it 's a problem .
also show her how great life can be without it .
admittedly i pulled a tl dr but i think you can accomplish this a few ways .
write her a letter and lay everything out as brutal and honestly as possible while making sure she knows these three things you 're worried about her you want her to be happy and you love and support her no matter what .
instead of helping her see the problem help her to realize how great life can be without it .
she does n't need to fully see it as a problem to recognize life 's value .
she just has to well recognize life 's value and cherish it .

the psychology of sexual assault is a certain way victims are scared they will not be believed scared of ruining their careers facing the details of the assault and so on .
this is a very clear pattern and we should be accommodating to this phenomena .
metoo is a huge step because it is making victims feel like they will be supported if they come forward .
so that tackles at least one of the issues listed above .
but this is very recent and still not completely a part of our society .
with tara reade specifically there would be no dna evidence for the assault .
and in other assaults there may also not be any .
tara reade has multiple credible people that were told about the assault at the time and corroborate her story .
i certainly hope you never have to deal with the kind of violence and threats that assault survivors have to deal with .
okay i 'm sorry i was harsh with you as well .

then why do n't you just have a sprinter or athlete feat that allows other to dash as a bonus action ?
true but then i think there would be issues dependent upon how much you change dash .
to explain what i mean if you increase dash too where someone dashing runs at regular human running speeds then characters who can double dash and then some would become semi speedsters but if you make a double dasher around top human levels of speed i.e .
usain bolt or slightly above someone dashing once would be too slow .
i think sprint using everything just to run is easier to balance and works better in gameplay .
a weapon rework..and you 're not trying for more realistic ... who 's your audience ?
ok so this kept coming up before and i realise i never talked about it but basically this is just for me and anyone who would like to implement it in their games .
i 'm not selling this or anything i just enjoy game design .
rereading it it does n't work like that ... but it could .
a change to cunning action or adding a bonus action attack if you 've made a shove or grapple might be smoother .
ah ok i will say i did add rules for applying sneak attack to grapples and shoves in the combat maneuver system which was basically you apply half damage to special attacks which i think fits since it could feel like you 're throwing them and plus using your attack to grapple on most characters costs 50 of their damage since it 's 1 attack of 2 but it costs 100 of their damage for a rogue normally since they have 1 attack so i think this works better .
you did n't but i just always like to name names .
then if the reddit changes or gets deleted people can still find you .

firstly saying the parties have 'switched ' is a bit simplistic .
it is fair to say they have changed however .
second i would n't think of progressives as an ideal of progress so much as an ideal promoting change .
i would similarly think of conservatism as 'resistance to change ' .
progressive ideals are like a gas pedal conservative notions like a brake .
each is important and necessary in the right context .
yes progressive ideals will get us where we need to be ... but conservative ones keep us from running off the bridge .
as examples conservative ideals typically oppose abortion as they see it as murder .
the core premises from which the parties operate are at odds .
thus the debate often devolves to arguments painting one side as the handmaid 's tale vs the other side being baby murderers .
and progressives are firmly convinced they are right as are conservatives .
there are organizations promoting pedophilia as a valid sexual orientation and preference .
they generally refer to themselves as 'maps ' or minor attracted person .
they are advocating being included under the lgbt umbrella .
i doubt any reasonable person here would disagree that the brake pedal is preferable in this case .
conservative ideals are valuable to test advocates for change to ensure only the right changes are made to ensure our changes progress society .
progressive ideals act as the inertia to become better .
the issue is n't with the ideals of the parties so much as the structure of the system that frames the debate .
nta but i think you should have had more of a conversation rather than just telling her to go away .
you told her to go elsewhere but you did n't say why .
so right now she thinks you told her to get lost because you 're a miserable prick .
i 'd have explained exactly why you are n't comfortable doing business with her .
specifically that you want your customers to be happy and satisfied with your service and over two visits she has expressed 1. dissatisfaction with your pricing namely that you charge any money at all 2. disapproval of your care of the animals and 3 .

the current standard for solar cell efficiency runs at twenty-five to thirty percent efficiency http solarcellcentral.com/limits_page.html under standard laboratory conditions slc .
an astonishing two-thirds of solar energy goes to waste with approximately twenty percent lost in photons passing the cells read the photons are too small and of too high frequency to collect and slip through and 47 of energy converted into heat read the photons are too large and of too low frequency to collect and are burnt up as heat .
quantum dots are a superior alternative to regular solar cell technology they possess tunable bandgaps via size variation https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=cxnzfr1qahu feature=youtu.be that allow for an expanded range of solar cell sizes that prevent photons of any wavelength slipping through .
their flexibility and availability to account for almost any available wavelength means no photon is too high or low in frequency to collect the largest collective source of energy waste is thereby fixed .
chinese research teams will be dedicated towards a superefficient second generation thin-film solar cell https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thin-film_solar_cell .
to save on costs cadmium telleride https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cadmium_telluride is to be utilised as the primary quantum dot nanocrystal given its popularity in emerging solar technologies and capacity for mass production .
while is noted to degrade faster than most standard solar cells with a lifespan of approximately 20-25 years early models already operate at over sixty percent efficiency https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nanocrystal_solar_cell more than 40 greater than the silicon-based standard .
in the past china has dominated the solar cell market with its own first generation silicon solar cell manufacturers with the last cadmium telleride-based producers running bankrupt for well over ten years https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thin-film_solar_cell production cost_and_market and bought by china below cost little competition is expected to oppose the shift towards newer technologies .
testing and development is to be conducted until the 31st of december 2023 to optimise solar cell efficiency and minimise overall costs .
current expectations for the product are listed at 750,000 800,000 per acre and an overall efficiency of 70-80 .

recently i 've been digging deep in my memories more than usual and i started digging up memories of my childhood more specifically my history of behavioral health .
it has been eating me alive for the past three days .
a little background when i was in about first grade my teachers reached out to my parents concerning my behavior in school i.e .
staying in my own little bubble which was caused by zoning everything out and inattentiveness and or being uninterested in what my peers or teachers were saying repetitive behaviors anger anxiety ticks clumsiness ect.shortley after my parents took me to see what i assume was a behavioral treatment center for an evaluation this is where my parents then shared their own experiences with my temper tantrums and anxiety at home .
my parents spent days taking me to see these behavioral doctors and it was frustrating for them due to the fact that right when the evaluators were finishing up their results for my evaluation they recomend i do more testing '' due to scattered and inconclusive results .
one of the main reasons for the inconclusivness of my evaluations had to do with the fact that i grew up in a bi-lingual home and to be honest having parents that always encouraged you to speak one language at home and then go to school to speak another definently hindered my vocabulary another reason was due to my childhood habit of giving zero attention to things i had no interest in and focusing on other things which definitely hindered the evaluators ability to properly evaluate some aspects of testing which required my undivided attention to a specific object or instruction .
due to this inconclusivness the behavioral center simply stated that i was healthy enough for my age at the time and recomended that my parents and my school put me in an iep individual education program and esl english as a second language program .
eventually i was removed from the esl program when the school found my english was good enough to continue my formal education without language aids however despite feeling like am average student and child in general the whole experience with with the behavioral professionals early on in my life really diminished my self esteem and i spent years feeling like i was stupid .
from that point on i spent most of my k-12 academic life not even putting in the effort as i felt like i would just screw it up anyway .
the worst part of it all was my ticks and twitches which would happen when i got super anxious not only were they embarrassing but when i would go home i would get chewed put by my parents for not controlling them '' which would only make me feel worse .
my parents are from northern mexico jalisco so i dont really blame them for their way of handling these sorts of situations that 's how they were raised .
by the time i reached seventh grade i reached an absolute low i would not shower for weeks and i would have intense panick attacks at night i never had much social skills to begin with but by seventh grade i had completely lost whatever little social ability i had .
fast forward to mid freshman year of high school and i suddenly felt the best i ever had i had gained a bit more confidence in my self and despite still being very socially isolated i was happy with my few friends and my self and i finally started giving my academics more attention .
sophomore year i had a complete boost in confidence i joined my school 's rotc program and advanced concert choir and i felt like my social skills also went from 0 to 100 !
there were a few hiccups here and there one of which happened in the winter of my sophomore year while waiting for my mom to pick me up from school i was waiting outside the school parking lot i was anxious that day and i started to twitch .
i noticed some punk kid in front of started mocking my tick .
my mother finally picked me up and i tried to strike up a conversation by telling her about my tick and the ass that started mocking me she responded by telling me that i was ridiculous '' and that a 15 year old should know better '' she went on about how i was n't a little kid anymore and i should learn to control myself '' .
just like that my self esteem had dropped all it took was a 10 minute ride home .
by my junior year i tried to just forget about all that stuff and focus on school and myself .
i was n't the best student but by the end of my junior year i had accomplished an average enough gpa and 2 honors credits i finally decided that maybe i was capable of more than i thought and i needed to stop putting myself down .
halfway through my senior year i had stumbled upon an interesting read it was about aspergers .
the more i read the more it sounded familiar and the more curious i got .
i finally broke down and asked my mother to please let me see all the paperwork from when i had gone to the behavioral center as a child .
that 's when i learned all the details i 've listed from my childhood .
i thought she would scold me for wanting to review the paperwork but it seems by then something changed in my mother she accepted my request with no hesitation and even told me that she would not hesitate to help me find help psychologically if i needed to work some things out .
after reading every single document the end result of my evaluation was as i stated in the beginning of this post scattered results and inconclusiveness .
i felt relieved that i was as normal as everyone else but i also felt annoyed that i spent years feeling stupid and incompetent over a short period in my life that should n't even have mattered to me in any way .
now at 21 it all started coming back to me after feeling cheated out of a management position a year ago i felt i deserved at the job i was at loyalty for years after finding out my aunt has been spreading rumors about me that i dropped out of college despite the fact that i graduated i broke down again and all the crap from years ago started coming back to me .
what the hell does it mean i would go seek help but i 'm to fearful of what they might tell me .
i spent so much energy trying to pretend like none of that crap ever happened and just live like every other person but i feel like if i do n't deal with this it will never leave my head !

hi guys i just bought a v60 and want to start brewing but i do n't have any grinder yet
i guess i 'll brew with pre-ground coffee then but i was curious to know if any of you had any tips to brew with pre ground coffee ?
please excuse me for bothering you with what might be a mundane question .
i 'd love to know if the following firewire card should be compatible with my new motherboard .
i 'm a bit of a loss understanding if i 've got all my details correct as this is all out of my expertise and the last system i built was from back in the core i7 920 era .
i think i will be in the clear and this is to hopefully work with an old audio interface that 's limited to firewire connections .
i 'm very open to suggestions and recommendations and if it 's of any help i 'm located in aus and here are some additional specs
windows 10 ryzen 5 3600 gtx 970 16gb ram gigabyte ga-a320m-h board and i 'm considering a startech.com 4 port pci 1394a
i have an oculus quest 128gb that works great .
this gets plugged via the recommended anker cable into my hp spectre x360 13 '' 10th-gen which itself is plugged into an egpu razer chroma with a 2070 super .
specifically it works great with steamvr and with some oculus rift games via oculus link .
however certain games like the climb '' and guided meditation vr '' crash regularly immediately after loading and before loading respectively .
at this point i 'm reluctant to download anymore oculus games and instead just go straight up through the quest or use streamvr exclusively .
however i 'm curious is there a troubleshooting path i can take when these crashes happen ?
is there a crash or event log available anywhere ?
tl dr is there a good standard workflow for troubleshooting problems with specific oculus apps/games ?
i am taking che 321 with zachary katsamanis he replaced dale d. i think .
anyways how is the class and how does it work online during the summer ?

i 've been in queue for an hour and a half and i think it 's just because it 's a one time instance that nobody is doing it .
just wanted to quickly introduce myself to the community .
i 'm the newest mod i love philippine real estate !
i 'll help u/r09a0ton the other mods moderate real estate postings .
under the philippines real estate service act resa or r.a. 9646 filipinos are required to have a prc license to offer for sale or for lease/rent properties if they do n't personally own the properties .
as such we 'd like start requiring members to simply include their prc real estate license whenever they post for sale or for lease/rent properties .
note that you do not need to post your real name what is needed is just your prc license .
if you 're the buyer looking to buy or the tenant looking to lease/rent there is no need for a license .
to those not familiar with resa the law was created to protect buyers tenants legal real estate professionals from transacting with scammers illegal operators criminals .
if a person tries to sell or offer for lease/rent a property that s/he does n't own s/he does n't have a prc license that 's considered a criminal act and is punishable under resa .
if you 're a buyer or a tenant do n't transact if the person offering properties do not have a prc license .
if and when something goes wrong with your transaction you do n't have any protection .
if you 'd like to make real estate your business and you do n't have a license you may easily get a salesperson certificate license by joining a prc-acctedited real estate seminar .
the average cost for the seminar is p5k and p400 for the prc id .
i got accepted into the social sciences 1 program at mac and the social work program at laurier brantford campus .
i want to explore my options at mac but right now im more focused on going into social work .
can anyone who is in the mac social work program tell me more about the process and likelihood of getting into it by second year ?
im also debating whether i should just go ahead for my bsw but im afraid i might regret going into it later .
anyone also in the laurier social work program that can tell me possible differences between the two other than already being in the program ?

i 've got a gigabyte b85m-d3h https www.gigabyte.com/us/motherboard/ga-b85m-d3h-rev-10-11 ov in my rig that i believe is dead .
i took it outside about a month and a half ago to spray some compressed air and it worked fine for a couple days .
it crashed once started up then crashed again a short time later and has been dead since .
when i push the power button the cpu and power supply fans spool up and then cut off within the second .
the power light on the front of the machine lights up and then dies .
right now i 've got no components installed in the machine .
i 've only got the 24 pin connector in .
i got the same result before i pulled the ram and the gpu .
i get no system beep when i push the power button .
i tested the power supply with the paperclip method .
i plugged the 24 pin from the psu into another pc and the cpu and psu fans spooled up and stayed running .
the components were ordered and assembled about 5 years ago .

i sat down with the videographer last friday and we basically got an outline done .
i was having a hard time focusing on things and remembering many of the events .
we are going to take our time with the documentary .
i had experiences from 1990-all the way up until basically 2017/18 .
there is so much to remember and my memory is more like a giant interconnected web than a logical sequence of events .
ideas are welcome but i 'm thinking of watching some other people 's documentaries such as paranormal witness to stir up some memories .
i just have so many paranormal things that happened it 's hard to tell it where it makes sense .
i 'm open to other ideas of how to stir up some memories if anyone has any .
i basically have a notepad i keep notes on and when i think of something i jot it down .
i see the videographer every friday so updates will be coming !
i have a project going that requires some trash bags .
for example ofws earning php120k and lower is exempt but those earning higher should pay like the rest of us here in the country .
or if they do not have dependents they should be paying a discounted rate or something .
some say ofws would not be able to use health benefits as they 're abroad but some of them have got spouses and children who might someday use these benefits have n't they ?
my point is we all should contribute to strengthen our universal healthcare system to have the means to support our healthcare workers who have long been taken advantage of .
to have the capacity to purchase latest medical machineries and tools .
we should all pay what is due not just the working class who are stuck chose to work in our country .
i do n't come on reddit often but i have n't found any posts about this at all .
i just finished my ranked placements and have played a few ranked games and my team consistently has 200 ping and does n't speak a word of english .
most of the time they 're 4 stacks who refuse to heal or use any of their abilities for me it 's kind of ridiculous that i 'm the only person on the team with 50 ping .
i understand it 's a closed beta and things like this are going to be an issue but ranked is unplayable right now .

i was looking for alternatives to buying genuine toner for my printer w1106a or 106a and i stumbled upon this way of loading a hacked firmware to the printer so that it thinks that the toner loaded is genuine and at 100 .
my question is what really happens when you load this firmware what does it really change and if the printer could after that update its software or am i blocked with this hacked version ?
i am really curious about this because would save a lot of money one genuine toner is half the price of the whole printer but it would be kind of unsafe .
for faster response add me on steam or add me to discuss .
ca n't wait for another random buff to his passive river blade and his s2 .
it may have been explained before but it does n't seem unnecessary for the servers to be wiped for every big update .
it just makes it annoying trying to work to the kappa container and then the mission reset .
the reason why it is so hard for is due to school and how i lose time to playing and results in me not playing the game and by summer time the game gets reset and during the summer i work which honestly sounds like a me problem .
ultimately losing progress and not being able to climb the ladder before the entire lower part gets cut off .
could they at least give that option to players for them to be reset or not .
idk i wanted some thoughts and maybe someone to rant with .
hi sorry for the weird request but i 'm looking for earbuds recommandations preferably wireless not true wireless of course that could last the whole night .

long story short i liked a girl was texting her a lot like a lot a lot apparently according to a now mutual friend annoying her a lot .
we do n't talk or text now and i now i understand i was way to overbearing and annoying .

i do n't live in the country anymore so it cant really effect me .
she was really nice about letting me down easy i was leaving the country so i just confessed to clear my head
i have read the article about linking nexon account to steam account when you download and run for the first time .
my case is quite far from that and it 's not shown in any faq 's .
i started playing ms in steam with my existing steam account and i made a new nexon account recently .
what the article about linking nexon and steam says is limited to the first time users and i was unable to find anything that can proc that exact popup asking for your nexon account email .
is there a way to proc that popup or sending them a ticket the only solution ?
if i were to max out a d/k/g that was n't available in the shop pipelocked would i still be eligible to receiving level up tickets ?
for example if i levelled up the gold train to level 6 will i still be able to receive d/k/g tickets in the shop high end ones ?

the u.s. did win the space race because the whole goal was to get a person on the moon .
because the thought was whoever got to the moon first could put a nuke on the moon first and both sides were afraid the other would get a nuke on the moon and have an almost permanent threat that they could do nothing about .
obviously that did n't happen but russia doing everything else first did n't really matter when the end goal was to put a womd on the moon .
this is based on the propaganda being spread by both sides at the time which was really what the space race was .
one big political/military pissing contest to prove who was better and the u.s. got there first .

bought all my hollister jeans for 15-25 and they 've all held up after countless wears/washes and still do n't look like crusty black jeans .
going with what the other user said they 're stupidly comfortable i occasionally kept them on around the house after errands during colder times .
yeah i guess there 's not really a reason to .

i would love to see sorta like an old bioware romance system where you do quest for them give them certain things say the right stuff and a little bit of fallout 4 where your skills actually matter to where you have a character that lets just say is a farm girl similar to erik the slayer in terms of back story but has always been scared of the outside world and trusting people and you the pc have to use your speech skills and actually building up trust to convince her that you are someone who can be trusted

get mission on a inside billbord from the guilds who are busy with the incoming invasion .
they finaly get to buy the inn and use the guild as a financing operation while raising a guildless army for fighting the invader .

i do love the stainless steel construction of the xs too .
that 's what i 've got too the 105 and the 55 1400 ?
but i have two 1400 's because i made the mistake of not getting the one with index holes in it when i had the choice because i was still new to festool and so had to go back and buy it later .
if only i 'd known to buy the one with holes in the first place .
they 're inexpensive plastic things that screw into any surface including a garage door and hold your rails even upside down .
i love that my rails are just on my garage door and not wasting precious wall space and are safe to lift over my head when i open the door
betterly makes a cool 100 blue tool that 's heavy and solid and does work to align two rails .
but if you can have a 105 in your garage and not have to align two rails then all the better .
i often have the 105 on a sheet of plywood and the 55 on another table cutting up the piece i just cut off the sheet .
i 'd hate to waste the time attaching and detaching two rails constantly
ran the numbers for my calories for the day and i actually did n't do so badly .

you continue to dismiss without a thought the strategy of taking long-term approach with an inexperienced qb
in the mean time we need someone that knows how to play .
i do n't believe he 's to the point where additional playing time will improve his game .
jackson spent his rookie year with people saying he should be playing every other position but qb and it took an mvp season to shut them up .
so what you 're saying is if you play well people wo n't doubt you and if you do n't they will ?
my limited understanding with sigils is that the intention of forgetting it is that when you created and documented it in the first place the purpose ends up getting filed away in your subconscious .

edit op had changed the post to include some of his/her history so i wanted to share my story because there are elements that are similar .
hopefully he/she can find some comfort in it and not feel so alone .
it 's a good thing they are not rushing to a diagnoses because finding the right course of treatment and/or medication is paramount .
anyone in your shoes would have a difficult time dealing with this and you have my deepest sympathy for the ordeal you are going through and i wish you nothing but the best .
when i was about five years old i told my mom i hate myself and want to die. this was the first sign of trouble and the beginning of nearly 20 years of confusion wrong or contradictory diagnoses and depression and anxiety .
as i grew older and had severe depression anxiety behavioral and attention problems my parents did everything they could to get to the bottom of it .
we got second opinion after second opinion and i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder adhd dysthymia major depressive disorder and odd .
in short they were handing out diagnoses like halloween candy .
i had major adjustment issues in middle junior and high school .
i was constantly bored in class and to pass the time i drew .
this got me in trouble constantly and i was given detentions .
i drew in detention and this led to in-school suspension and it just escalated from there .
i was also a very sensitive kid and was the target of a bullies .
things just got worse and i felt progressively more lonely and alienated .
the ones administered by the school resulted in scores that put me in the average to below average range .
the crazy thing is that i took multiple tests by different doctors outside of school and they all resulted in scores in the superior to gifted range .
the school system wanted nothing to do with me and my parents had to hire a lawyer to try and get some sort of accommodation in the hopes that i could just get through school .
in the end based on my diagnosis of adhd i was given a iep and put in classes for students with disabilities .
this just made things worst for my own self-esteem and for the constant bullying .
i was put on a series of medication including ritalin prozac and lithium for a mood stabilizer .
they made things worse not better especially the lithium which thankfully was short lived but i blacked out that point in my life .
to this day i have no memory of what happened .
the other drugs combined with my depression led me to gain a ton of weight .
this further affected my self-esteem problems and the bullies had new material to work with .
i managed to get through high school albeit psychologically and spiritually damaged along with my family who suffered through this with me .
i stopped taking meds and coasted through life in my early to mid 20 's .
i managed to lose all of the weight i put on through diet and exercise though i still felt like a fat kid '' and had terrible self-esteem .
this led to a lot of poor choices nothing illegal or immoral per se but its a time of my life i was not proud of .
i finally tried college again in my mid 20s .
i found there were a lot of other psych majors that like me where really there to figure out what the fuck they were and what was wrong with them .
the crazy thing was that i really thrived in college and after my second year got straight a 's throughout .
now in my late 30 's i still carry a ton of baggage from the past but i am working with a therapist to let go of it and focus on the positive things .
my therapist and psychiatrist helped me realize that i was a highly sensitive and gifted kid that just got lost in the system due to my add and challenges caused by asynchronous development the latter being somewhat common with gifted kids .
overcoming this crap has been an ongoing struggle but i met an awesome woman fell in love and got married .
things are n't perfect and i still deal with loneliness alienation and self-esteem issues .
the moral of the story is that psychological testing evaluation and diagnosis is far from perfect .
many mental illnesses are diagnosed by exclusion meaning that they try to rule everything out first .
this is clearly imprecise and imperfect but even after 100 years of research and insight the brain is still a mystery .
being highly sensitive made my problems that much more unbearable and traumatizing but i think in a way there are positive things that i can pull out of it .
people have suffered through far worse but i 'm reminded by the fact that human suffering is relative .
hopefully you have a good support system at home .
hopefully you find what you are looking for in this subreddit that will give you the courage and strength to bear down and endure the challenges ahead .
i absolutely agree that we can be thoughtful and respectful when we interact with other people i just think that this can backfire into making people responsible for things they could n't have possibly known .
i have been close with codependents who think they 're being thoughtful and respectful '' when they 're really just being controlling .
i have also been close with people who did not share their wants or needs even when they were asked to .
i do n't know if we can assign responsibility '' in misunderstandings .
men like you are the reason the world is the way it is slimy and dishonorable men who cower in fear as they strike .
like the modern day jew you crawl your way to supremacy by cheating and lying .
act like a man and take criticism with a grain of salt without crying
sure we might find something else but religion would be one less to worry about also in many places peoples political affiliation is/can be at least partially determined by their religion .
another problem is when people build a country for a religious group .
see israel/palestine there is also the case that many people within the same racial group also follow the same religion so they kinda go hand and hand .
secondly most of the western world where people are moving away from religion have the highest/best amount of freedom for women which i wouldnt call a coincidence .
there is also the fact that in deeply religious countries women and other minorities such as those apart of the lgbt community are commonly and aggressively discriminated against as many religions seem to forbid homosexuality and other unholy peoples .
lastly the lack of remorse for killing domesticated animals such as dogs and cats just further proves the regressiveness of these cultures .
it may also be said that most countries where people eat dogs and cats are among the poorest in the world whilst many of their populations still consider themselves religious again id be very hard pressed to call this a coincidence .
there are other ways to help yourself mentally religion isnt the only solution .
also you say the only way to be free from religion is to have freedom of religion but id say though not particularly kind if the countries of the world were all secular with a ban on religion then we 'd still technically be free from religion and given time religion would die out
youtube videos are great but sometimes you run into little things so it helps to have someone that has done it before to help you along the way .
i had my big brother help me but if you do n't have anyone like that then no worries you can always ask questions here bud

your you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide '' comment sums it up quite well .
i justify piracy far more than i actually pirate .
i care a lot about morality so i pay for as many things i enjoy as possible provided that the copyright holder does n't use anti-consumer tactics like drm that make it impossible to comfortably view something legally while also criticising copyright in its current form for stifling creativity by stopping people from making derivative worksm and for putting intellectual property '' which is n't true property https mises.org/library/intellectual-property-not-true-property over the rights of people 's actual physical personal property .
i should be able to arrange the bits on my hard disk however i want and once i buy something i should be able to give it to others as per the first sale doctrine .
if this destroys your business model you need another business model and i will do everything in my power to make alternative business models viable business models that do n't restrict what people can and can not do with their personal property .

another interesting idea is that diamonds could actually be considered organic life depending on who you ask because their gems are most likely 100 carbon .
obviously i do n't expect the gems obey the structures of real world gems and they 're most likely not made of the same stuff as real world gems but it 's fun to think about .
i do n't have much hope but it changes my life a lot right now if i won

the current obligation https static1.squarespace.com/static/54c41c8ae4b07b213a50c6c6/t/5952cba459cc6820e576dceb/1498598309286/brown+scapular.pdf is daily recitation of one of the hours of the liturgy or of some psalms or the rosary or other equivalent prayers . ''
the point of the brown scapular is that you are uniting yourself in some way to the life of the carmelite brothers and sisters and the divine office is very important to them .
if you are n't already praying the hours even just one compline being a natural choice with its examination of conscience and marian antiphon is enough to meet this obligation and probably the most straightforward definite way to do so .
i do n't know what other equivalent prayers '' means and the divine office/liturgy of the hours mostly consists of praying the psalms already so the instruction can basically be drilled down to regular structured prayer through the office or the rosary whichever one comes most natural to you .
obviously if you 're able to do both most days that 's even better .

the latest logic release includes a live loops '' view that reminds me a lot of ableton 's session view .
not saying logic is a inferior daw but logic 's features that copy live are inferior to the original live features .
live loops '' were in garageband for years yet never saw anyone trying to push the narrative garageband is better than ableton live and make no mistake plenty of live haters out there who would have tried if they thought it would stick .
i 'm american and i have no idea if the american president or the brazilian president said this .
it 's actually really good for players and the dm .
while valuables might be the natural thing the players are searching for there 's so much more that may require specificity the dm had n't thought of .
perhaps they have the feeling that these bandits are associated with the bbeg and the dm had n't thought of how good that would be until that very moment .
or for some reason the players really want the villain 's sword because even though it was nothing to the dm they 've grown an affinity for it thanks to the flavour text used to describe it and the harm it inflicted .
allowing the players to contribute specific details can really help flesh out the world and give validity to the images in the players ' minds .

i was a paralegal/delivery girl in a law firm .
let me make it clear first there were two lawyers the boss and me .
the boss always told me i was working well i often asked them all for a feedback .
at some point something hapened between me and the boss .
i think it started when i got really ill and took a sick leave .
but i still had to go to uni once for a coursework consultation .
the boss called me when i was in the underground on my way to uni .
he told one of my coworkers that i must 've been faking the illness and was actually going to an interview for a new job i clearly was not .
my screwed up voice did n't mean anything to him .
i ended up going back to work way earlier than i should still very sick .
since then he got increasingly more hostile even though i told him i was not planning on leaving .
he also started lashing out on our senior lawyer who ended up leaving .
he treated her really badly to the point when he insulted her and made her cry at her last work day .
she told me that when she 's gone i would most likely be promoted to a junior lawyer position .
when i politely asked him what would the new lawyer 's duties be he suddenly got all defensive and blamed me for pushing him into promoting me '' i was n't even talking about promotion .
then he told me i did n't deserve it which really shocked me because as i 've mentioned above he always gave me positive feedback on my work .
the lawyers told me it was due to me being good at my then-current job to the point he did n't want to replace me .
my job meant communicating with all kinds of state institutions and solving problems in the process on the spot as well as delivering and filing docs and promotion would mean solely paperwork .
i do n't know if it was true but both lawyers said this to me independently of each other and they also were the ones who gave me almost all the work .
at the time i had severe depression and my boss ' words nearly shattered what was left of my self-esteem .
thanks to my psychotherapist i managed to cope with it .
the one lawyer that was left in the firm actually tried to talk me into staying and then talk the boss into stopping me and at least giving me a raise .
but i left anyway and did right because the current job i have pays me 4x of what i got for previous one and i 'm actually valued .
this reminds of the whole first order and second order chaos systems thing that harari talks about in sapiens .
second order chaotic systems respond to predictions so if you predict something is going to happen and take steps to successfully prevent it that perpetuates the perception that your prediction was wrong even though it was technically correct .
when i got the notification of the first comment it said something like this song has been out for years and still sucks balls '' ?

i really hope they improve at least some aspects of the clip editing .
honestly i 'd be happy if just the 'trim clip ' feature worked more than 40 of the time without freezing .
however some of these advanced features you mentioned are very system-memory intensive particularly if you want to be able to do them in-game near impossible i do n't see the audio-track stuff happening hopefully we just get an overall audio fidelity improvement .
i could see them doing something like this if only in a standalone editing app which would force close other running apps to make it work .

i 've read a fair amount of leftist theory one of my degrees is in political science .
his whole schtick was a parody of a parody e.g .
i do n't see color so i would n't know '' bit that mocks the colorblind '' approach to racial issues usually employed by the right but with a grain of truth that also parodies the left .
to understand chapo in that way is to ask if the whole thing is really a satire of the left in favor of the right with a wink and nudge no really were just more left than you '' as another layer .
the problem is n't that the book/cth in general is holding historical events to modern sensibilities it 's that they 're actively omitting or selectively highlighting certain aspects of history to serve an agenda .
saying a historical scientist was wrong to believe the earth revolved around the sun is one thing saying he 's an idiot is another .
to employ the reddit favorite godwin 's law you 'd rightfully point out my error if i said the nazis were good because of advances they made in science and medicine and ignored the genocide that contributed to those advances in horrific ways .
cth 's use of revisionist versions of history are the same .
i do n't think the book was meant to be a treatise either but if it 's not to be taken some degree of seriously it becomes a parody of the far-left .

literally just a weak point in your perimeter so that baddies will flood that area instead of attacking places you want kept safe then just some sort of killing thing turrets traps pawns in that weak point '' .
the great thing about quarantine is that you can focus on yourself .
you have the opportunity to learn new skills work out at home and be as productive as possible .
you will not get anywhere in life if you live off of the expectations of other people .
once you start being consistent with your learning and passions that self hatred will disappear and you will develop confidence plus self-acceptance .
the other thing is do n't tell a soul about what you are learning or pursuing .
it feels empowering to know things that nobody would expect to know about you .
also if you are watching porn stop that immediately .
that bullshit will ruin your mind and desensitize yourself to real pleasure .
i get that we use the word liberal today as just a catch all for democrats/progressives that 's not the true meaning of liberal .
liberal means that you believe in a hands-off approach to government the government should n't interfere with your personal rights .
as a libertarian he 's about as liberal as it gets .
so it 's not really that he 's cool with liberal things he 's into rather he 's simply socially liberal and fiscally conservative .
tbh i do n't think it 's gon na go that much higher it 's very similar to bc and bu and i feel like all those schools will stick together in terms of ranking .
all of those schools are similarly selective and offer different programs that appeal to different students .
i really do n't see it rising to the level of georgetown cmu nyu etc .
also being number one in co-op does n't mean much since many schools do n't offer it and i do n't see it appealing to a wide base of students
have n't rlly looked into that tbh since i only take aps for the gpa and a varied transcript

windhelm itself definitely does have more racism than any other city i 'll agree with that .
but ulfric and the stormcloaks do n't share those sentiments .
if they did the stormcloaks would n't accept argonian recruits .
and the dunmer of windhelm are the overzealous type that the nords have been fighting for generations .
to have an age old enemy suddenly move into your city only to complain about you not care if nords are dying and not at all trying to renovate the grey quarter for themselves to have a better home in instead allowing it to remain squalor making tensions high in the city ?
yeah i would n't be to proud of then either ... and the cherry on top is if they say anything about disliking this then they 're branded 'racist ' .
i think the dunmer are far more likely to do that than the nords .
are the argonians on the docks treated fairly by the shatter-shields ?
should the argonians have a more furnished place to live ?
this is between the dockworkers and shatter-shields no stormcloaks involved .
i 'm sure that when the civil war has been won and ulfric becomes the rightful high king he 'll do something about the rise of rasicm in windhelm and try to smooth tensions .
but for now with leading a civil war for skyrim 's independence as against a dying empire that 's sunk it 's fetid claws into skyrim banned the worship of arguably the nords most beloved diety there are bigger things at play than whipping the shatter-shields into place and giving our egg-kin some nicer homes which by the way they could renovate themselves nothings stopping them it 's their docks and their home
curious as to the age of the house/ceilings if you 've ever had a roof replacement ?
after we replaced our roof we started having problems with cracking in the ceiling and sheetrock screws began to appear .
when the roof was replaced we changed the attic ventilation from static vents to ridge vents .
after repair the sheetrock twice i discovered that the ridge vents were not installed properly .
long story short the attic virtually had no ventilation .
this resulted in high heat and humidity in the attic that led to the ceiling below losing their sheetrock .
how about you all realize that you are fighting the same battle right now so you better go win it because once you do there is plenty of time to debate over policy issues and try to pull each other different ways and such ... .but if you lose right now you have nothing .
you are at the whim of the presidential equivalent of a crackhead .
will joe biden give every sanders fan exactly what they want ?
will he soften and move on issues to try and bring in the other wing of the party and at least talk with them and make the smart political move of making some concessions to them opposed to trump who will march every issue backwards yes .
but he is n't a fool and he will move on issues if the party as a whole shows support for something so keep supporting what you believe in and electing representatives that do the same .
one president ca n't come in and magically fix everything you think is wrong .
you have to move public opinion and you have to vote for the best people at every level of government from state all the way to federal .
too many people get overly emotionally invested in one presidential election when they were n't into politics before and then when miracles do n't happen they check out and stop voting instead of realizing that it just means they need to vote more .
they need to pay attention to their senators and house reps their governors their state assemblymen etc etc .
politics is a slow game ... you got ta keep playing and keep voting for what you believe .
even though it 's a world of blocks they 're trying to be realistic .

this perfectly describes the situation of vanellope going turbo at the end of the wreck it ralph sequel .
when ralph went turbo in the original everyone panicked all because he wanted a medal .
he then learns that going turbo is a terrible crime in their world and friends are more important than objects
however when vanellope went turbo no one cared except ralph all because she wanted to abandon him and everyone in sugar rush only so she can follow her dreams . ''
this shows that vanellope is more of a selfish asshole in this movie than ralph was in the entire series .

countless knight of berenike once extolled as the mightiest of the mighty became undead and ventured to lordran .
but their journey was for naught as they went hollow and became a threat to all undead .
i thought it was all pretty fair game when it came to that
those who are unfit to link the fire do n't revive the age of fire they 're merely consumed by the flame reduced to ash until the bell tolls and the lords go without thrones .
in ds3 the ashen one and all of the unkindled you encounter tried and failed to link the fire .
their souls were n't strong enough to sate it .
so in that regard anyone can link it but not everyone can link it successfully .
but ehh the army thing really was really just a throw away comment .
i 'm just trying to say that any person can do what the cu did especially other undead and that there 's no destined prophecy just preparation meeting opportunity
i disagree about anyone being able to do it .
clearly not everyone was able to do what the chosen undead did countless knights tried and failed and as we see in ds3 you need a sufficiently powerful soul in order to link the flame .
i think it 's more that the chosen undead could have been anyone before they became the chosen undead .
more like anton ego 's quote from the end of ratatouille about how not everyone can become a great artist but a great artist can come from anywhere .
the part in question is what made them the chosen undead .
did they beat the asylum demon because they are the chosen undead or are they the chosen undead because they were able to beat the asylum demon .
you 're right that the idea of linking the fire is just something the gods told humanity in order to preserve the age of fire as evidence by ds3 and there is certainly no deity of fate that we know of to suggest that there could be something preordained like the linking of the fire .
but that does n't mean it 's a lie it 's just a self fulfilling prophecy .
the prophecy and the world at large is set up in a way to guarantee that it is fulfilled and will always be fulfilled when the time comes
but the chosen undead is a very real character .
they are the chosen undead ultimately because they have the ability to link the fire not anyone can do that .

i was lucky to get 3 tri-lands in the colors i play most cause it sucks to have to use wc for them .
but yeah when a set drops like eldrain and you have to get some questing beasts and robber of the riches you gon na be glad you have the mythics

nah heat mats to me personally are the worst out of all heating options .
not saying people that use them are bad ofcourse .
it will work but not in an optimal way .
there is a big misconception about belly heating '' .
heat mats do n't penetrate the substrate decently do n't create a basking spot and do n't create an ambient temperature .
overhead heating is way more natural and the animal can choose the amount of direct heat it gets by lying directly under the lamp under a bark under the lamp completely on the other end colder side .
we do n't use any heat mats we did try them not saying these things without having tried and seen the difference in my own snakes and never had any issues .
all our enclosures have che oh and we have 2 mbk btw .
do make sure any heat source is on a thermostat though heat source plugs into thermostat thermostat into wall socket .
if not they are a fire hazard and risk burning the snake .

hi sorry if this has been asked before but i was having trouble finding the answer .
i have only ever used premiere for the past 10 years but am trying to expand my professional horizons plus i 've been pretty frustrated with some premiere quirks '' lately so i 'm working on learning how to use avid media composer .
i downloaded the 30 day trial for 2020 and was set to follow the latest tutorial on lynda which was made a couple years ago for 8.7 .
i have n't gotten too deep in yet but it seems that updates have substantially changed avid and its layout .
should i go ahead and stick with it and just try to figure out where things have changed ?
i really want to learn as much of the fundamentals for avid properly so i can be fully prepared if an opportunity to use it comes along .
also related note do professionals tend to use the latest version or is there some version snobbery like how many stuck with fcp7 for a long time when fcpx came out ?
is there much use in learning the older versions in addition to the latest version ?

actually sound so alike in this song specifically it 's uncanny
3 also zuko 's whole story line revolved around revenge themes so the lyrics also have an uncanny link to zuko it 's crazy
please someone help me find an amv artist who takes requests who will put these two things together for me .
they 're so perfect please do n't overlook this .
it would be a genuine masterpiece anyone who can help please do lol .

why you should consider listening to music in 432 hz most of the world 's music has been tuned to 440 hz since the international organization for standardization iso promoted it in 1953 .
however by looking at the vibratory nature of the universe it is possible that this tone is not really harmonious with the natural resonance of nature and may generate negative effects on human behaviour and consciousness .
it is said that 440 hz frequency music conflicts with some of our chakras that reside from the base of the spine to the heart .
it is said that this music stimulates the ego and function of the left brain which can suppress our intuition .
there is tons of information around this frequency and many seem plausible given that the mainstream music industry relies on propaganda and mental control .
432 hz would be mathematically consistent with the models of the universe .
it is said that 432 hz vibrates with the universe phi and unifies the properties of light time space matter gravity and magnetism with biology dna code and consciousness .
when our atoms and dna begin to resonate in harmony with the spiral of nature it is said that our sense of attachment to nature is amplified .
the number 432 is also reflected in the relationships of the sun the earth and the moon as well as in the procession of the equinoxes the great pyramid of egypt stonehenge and sri yantra among many other sacred sites .

hi all just got one of these but the instruction manual is very lacking so i 'm kind of just trying to figure out how to use it properly .
the user manual in the app is n't particularly informative either so it 's been mostly trial and error so far .
we have some areas that go from floorboards seamlessly in to carpet and i wanted to try to use the mop function .
so this morning i turned on the map saving mode why is n't this on by default ?
let it do it 's thing sent it back to the charger to charge up a bit before it started mopping then when i started it up again it just started mapping from the beginning meaning i could n't block it off from those carpeted areas .
the manual said to use the xiaomi home app but apparently there is a standalone roborock app ?
i started in the fall semester last year and i did n't do very well .
as a result i corrected my mistakes and started off strong this semester .
right before our spring break my college closes down and switched to distanced learning .
as a way of not having to give full refunds to all students my school refunded all of the student 's room and board charges and gave all students the option to have their classes not count toward their gpa .
i did nothing during spring break but by the time distanced learning started i was used to doing nothing .
my professors had online conferences and posted homework and i barely did any of them .
when it came time for exams i was n't prepared .
my mindset was that i 'll get to it eventually but that time never came .
i also kept telling myself that if i got bad grades they would n't count towards my gpa .
what i overlooked was the fact that if i failed even if it did n't count towards my gpa i would n't receive credit for my classes and i would 've essentially waste a few thousand dollars .
i kept up my bad habits until now and at this point it seems like it 's impossible to pass my classes .
i 'm responsible for paying for my tuition so that 's a few thousand down the drain .
when my parents find out i 'm going to be in a world of trouble .
i 'm afraid of telling them because they might freak out .
they 're not usually extremely strict or abusive but i 'm really scared that they might be that way when they find out .
i ca n't leave my house atm so as soon as they see my grades it 's over .
i have a week at most until my grades are officially posted and then my parents will see them .
i was referred to come here by someone on r/feedthebeast after we worked for about 2 days trying to fix the issue i was having first he told me to post on the feedthebeast forum but all i got there was a reply saying they do n't support those versions anymore .
here https www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/gii924/forge_server_not_using_memory_when_its_meant_to is the reddit post i made on r/feedthebeast .
the issue i 'm having is that my servers are not using the minimum or coming even close to the maximum of the allocated memory on the aforementioned reddit post i went through a few different variations of my start.bat file and none of them seemed to work .
there are a few screenshots of the server running on the original post .
but i 'll be more than happy to provide log files or anything else you request relating to the issue i might be having

before i start also believe fathers day shouldent be husbands day but its alot less common to see people complaining about that .
growing up which i 'm still in the process of when we celebrate mother 's day and father 's day we always focus it on us celebrating our parents rather then our parents celebrating each other .
yes my parents still say happy mothers day and father 's day to eachother but they arent necessarily celebrating eachother .
the way i see it mothers day and father 's day should be more about celebrating your own parents .
recently though i 've seen alot of posts of mothers complaining that there husband isnt doing enough for them .
there are already enough holidays for people to celebrate their spouses and mothers day and fathers day !
should be about celebrating your parents and your children celebrating you .
another point i want to bring up is someone being the parent to your child isnt exactly something you need to congratulate or celebrate .
having a child was most likely a mutual decision between parents and isnt something you need to be praised for .
to summarize what i said in a sentence mothers day and fathers day should be about children celebrating their parents rather parents celebrating eachother .
i 'm absolutely fine if you beg to differ just please no hate .
so this is a big problem the ftb has the autocannons do n't work the point in direction of shape and shoot in the direction you put them in so do n't use the autocannons they do n't work and the ftb is probably is n't gon na fix it

what if they 're dormant waiting for someone to come awaken them and be granted their power ?
and what if they choose to make whoever awakens them their lover pet toy whatever they please so long as they 're given devoted worship ?
this idea is for those that would like quite a lot of surreal play and very dedicated dom/sub play .
i 'd play the goddess and you the one who awakens me .

this one while seemingly far darker can actually be a lit more lighthearted it really just depends on what direction we want to take it .
maybe i 've got pills that make my cock 5 feet long or make my balls so big i cum enough to fill a bathtub .
or maybe i just use aphrodisiacs to make you sell yourself to me in exchange for some sex .

for some reason or another be it loneliness from a bad divorce on my end or your curiosity about the thing i had when we showered while you were little somehow we wind up hooking up .

be sure to shoot me a message not chat if you 're interested including ideas kinks limits what you want to play and all that .
put effort in your message i am kinda picky !
cursed objects have always kinda been my family 's thing .
of course they were n't in a museum until it was my turn to be in charge of them .
my mothers insisted on keeping them in the family 's heavily warded basement storage room just as the previous generations had for centuries .
i on the other hand have always been something of an entrepreneurial spirit and especially after seeing how popular cursed objects and similar things have become i did n't see any reason not to put them on display .
hell my family has looked after these sorts of things for as long as our recorded history goes back .
you may be wondering why i 'm choosing to post here now .
apparently a smallish first-floor venue in the middle of a bustling big city does n't in and of itself draw much attention .
my girlfriend and co-owner emelie insists that if i want to make this work i need to get some people interested people who actually care about that sort of thing .
my name is alexis alex for short and i 'm here to tell you about the hall of the cursed .
em says the best way to go about this is to walk you through a day in my life so i 'll tell you a little bit about our hallowed hall and i 'll tell you about the new attraction i picked up this morning .
i tell you what no matter how many times you go through things like this it never stops being terrifying .
upon entering the museum you will undoubtedly notice a set of rules .
after all as you all probably know by now anyone working with the occult keeps a list of no-nos to survive especially if they 're involving random civilians who are n't experienced in this sort of thing .
following these rules is paramount to having a happy and healthy visitation and you will not be permitted until you sign a little harmless contract stating that you will follow these rules and that if not we at the museum are not responsible for any physical emotional or otherwise harm that may befall you .
the rules are as follows for your convenience as i am working on my customer service em says i 'm abysmal
do not touch any object in the museum without explicit permission from the museum staff or an official sign which will always contain at least one capital letter and which will always be properly spelled .
you must kiss the dog on the nose upon entering the museum .
follow all rules posted around the museum provided they contain at least one capital letter and are properly spelled .
wash your hands before leaving the washroom for at least thirty seconds .
visit the nokia cellphone room at your own risk .
the museum will not be held responsible for any chance deaths .
do not speak to him but nod politely if he looks your way .
always hold your breath when walking by the road sign .
if you breathe near the sign the museum will provide you with a complimentary bag of salt and sage and send you home with more detailed instructions .
each guest also receives a pamphlet with these rules although i 'm definitely getting a little weary of printing them .
these rules are simple to follow and after a couple of choice ... incidents ... with the pink bonnet over on the left which men are not allowed to come within six feet of we 've even placed yellow tape in a circle with a six-foot radius to keep idiots with poor estimation skills away from it .
no wonder the pandemic is causing so much trouble apparently all men are physically incapable of estimating a six-foot distance .
of course the list of rules for employees to follow is far more extensive but that 's not generally a problem since it 's just em jan and me jan being the janitor of course and that 's obviously not his real name but we do n't know what it is so bite me .
anyway this morning em got a call from a panicked stay-at-home mom who was reportedly in big trouble about some sort of vintage wedding dress she 'd found on ebay .
since em is really more the management type and i 'm the one who generally deals with the hands-on bits i was the one who somewhat reluctantly headed to the address .
i say reluctantly because i 've never found a single good thing attached to a wedding dress .
upon my arrival it became clear that something funny was going on .
there was the sound of a screaming child somewhere in a nearby room which i 've never been particularly fond of and the woman who greeted me at the front door was in poorly contained hysterics .
she had stringy brown hair although i suspected that it was generally less unkempt based on the obviously expensive comb wedged near the back of her head .
tears were streaming down her face and clearly had been for some time judging by the tomato color of her face and the general swollen stretch to it .
possibly most troubling was the blood staining her hands already browning as it dried .
for god 's sake she looks like she 's about to jump out of her skin .
she nodded jerkily like a badly made puppet or one with a particularly anxious puppeteer .
i followed her inside and was instantly hit with ... nothing .
i should expand here and mention that i 'm by no mean some sort of sensitive that 's more em 's thing and how we met a story for a different time i 'm sure .
that being said it 's hard to be around cursed objects for too long without getting a sense for the sort of evil miasma that leeches out of them .
so either this woman just needed some haloperidol or my circumstances at the time were not the right ones to invoke whatever was going on with this dress .
it 's ... in here '' the woman practically whispered .
i asked as i followed her into a modest kitchen then through another doorway into an equally modest living room .
in the other room the child continued to cry .
i assumed she had used the number my parents used to give out for any weird or unusual problems but still the police are usually the first choice for actual murder-related issues .
i just ... i did n't know what to do '' she said .
it was whispering to me telling me ... i did n't want to ... but for days for days it whispered and whispered and it was right !
it was right ... but now i ... oh god oh god i do n't know what came over me what did i do what did i do ... ''
mmkay i thought so she was n't going to be super helpful .
all i was gathering was that the dress had apparently been speaking to her no doubt persuading her to kill her husband .
that meant it was probably reasonably safe to transport in the lined bag i 'd brought .
most things were provided they were n't especially hostile .
do you know why it would ask you to hurt your husband mrs .
it ... it knew '' she said in hushed tones .
we stopped in front of a large closed oak dresser .
her shaking hand rested on the handle but did n't open it .
it told me ... it told me i 'd be safe .
in one swift motion she threw the dresser open .
hanging inside all alone was a vintage wedding dress in mint condition .
it was lovely all delicate lace and soft edges and white so pure it was nearly blinding .
the arms were long and translucent and the neckline was gently curved .
the second the woman 's gaze fell upon it her eyes hardened .
he 's better off dead '' she remarked coldly .
or rather we 're better off with him dead .
why do women fall into these toxic relationships and just allow themselves to remain there forever ?
no i had to do it and i 'm glad i did .
a quick glance to the other side of the dresser revealed her husband eyes wide in death spread-eagled on the ground with a knife still stuck in his chest alongside several other stab marks that no longer leaked blood as his heart no longer pumped .
it 's not like i have n't seen death before but ... the look in their eyes never gets less creepy .
not only that but ms. meyers still had that look in her eyes .
you might call it unhinged insane hungry for death or pain or something worse .
but for me it was the look of a curse .
the look of blankness of emptiness of a person completely not in control of their own body .
of a person to whom the limits of humanity and right and wrong have ceased to have meaning .
ms. meyers might have said the dress was whispering to her but this was not just whispering .
whatever was in that dress was in ms. meyers and i had no idea if it wanted me dead too .
sure i was n't a scumbag husband but i was definitely intruding and i 'm confident it knew it .
i backed away slowly nearly tripping over the carpet sending a jolt through my body .
my throat clenched up and i swear i felt like the dress itself was watching me as i tried to subtly place one of the dresser doors between it and myself .
professionalism alex you 'll get out of this faster and more alive if you remember your professionalism .
i 'm ... i 'm glad you were able to gain your ... your freedom . ''
that 's the other thing '' ms. meyers said .
her voice was louder now approaching a yell yet still remaining just as hard and cold .
her anger not hot but icy frozen made my stomach clench .
she would appreciate it if you could stop calling her it .
the laugh that bubbled out of me was mildly hysterical and i shoved down the awful feeling in my chest .
i was still backing up which i only realized when my foot hit the late mr. meyers ' limp leg and i almost tripped .
she is beautiful and she took good care of you . ''
after an impossibly long moment ms. meyers seemed to relax and some light some humanity returned to her eyes .
they were quite pretty when they were n't blank and evil a nice green .
feeling as though i 'd been released from an invisible vice i gasped in a breath of fresh air and relaxed although i definitely did take a step away from the body of mr. meyers .
i would love to take the dress '' the dresser doors wobbled dangerously .
i would love to take her with me and check her out . ''
the influence of a curse tends to leave you with an awful hangover not to mention the obvious guilt of murdering your husband regardless of how icky he was .
i 'm not sure if that 's okay . ''
her nerves made me suspicious that the dress could still exert some control even out of the line of sight .
i wonder if she would not appreciate the opportunity to meet more women . ''
there was a pause and i continued cautiously women with partners from all over the city .
ms. meyers ' eyes glazed over for a moment and i tensed but in the end she nodded .
thank you ms. meyers '' i said relieved that the dress had apparently given her permission .
either that or its influence only lasted so long when out of eyesight .
hard to tell but i was glad for it .
short minutes later i was at the door with the lined bag carefully nestled in my arms .
is there anything else you can tell me about her ? ''
it did n't target us in the same way at all .
if it had wanted to expand the way some cursed objects do it would have exerted its influence directly on me .
instead it seemed it connected with ms. meyers like there was a trigger as there often is .
i wondered vaguely if it was her feelings about her husband himself .
once i made it clear i was n't going to be a threat it did n't hurt me so it must not have been random .
either way i wanted to get as much information out of this poor lady as possible especially because you would not catch me messing with that damned thing again .
she 's beautiful '' sighed ms. meyers and went into a dead faint on the floor .
i made sure to tell them that i 'd seen someone else fleeing the scene and the wife desperately trying to save her bleeding husband .
the timeline wo n't be right and it 'll be overall pretty obvious that that 's not what happened but the police have long since learned that when someone from my family adopted child or not says something you trust it or pay the consequences .
he ran into that knife ... about six times .
back at the museum em pretty well confirmed my suspicions it seemed that the dress carried some nasty energy from a scorned new bride who had died tragically after some sort of cheating-related betrayal from her new husband .
as usual em got an awful headache after interacting with the thing leaving me to settle it into what we call the test room .
obviously before it hits public viewing it 'll have to be exposed to some visitors on an individual test basis first one by one then in pairs then in threes and so on .
we 'll have to test couples of course although we suspect it will only exert its influence on women in unfulfilling relationships .
we 'll have to see about same-sex versus opposite-sex relationships double-check whether it 's actually a visual line of sight that 's the issue or whether it 's physical proximity et cetera .
it 'll be an entire process but by the end of things we 'll have a lovely vintage dress hanging in the hall of the cursed .
anyway i hope to tell you all more about this soon as soon as i get a break things keep me pretty busy around here .
after all with every day comes a new vintage wedding dress that convinces you to murder your unfaithful husband .

i was playing basketball today and my old classmate from high school showed up randomly .
and i could barely tell him what college i graduated from and what i am doing currently .
i just said i have to go and left .
i had bought an item through depop app from a seller and everything was fine but she messaged me a few weeks later and said that she did n't receive payment neither of us knew what happened .
long story short a week later my depop was suspended .
i checked my email and depop emailed me and said it was because paypal refunded the money to me bc her paypal was n't verified .
i was not aware that paypal did this until i checked my email .
depop said they 've suspended my account until i send the money to payments depop.com mailto payments depop.com on paypal which because depop had reimbursed the seller .
that 's fine its fair so i sent the money to that paypal address and emailed depop with proof .
i 'm just wondering if anyone else who has experienced this got their accounts unsuspended after emailing proof of resending the payment ?
theres no doubt that quarantine makes life difficult in so many domains but i never expected it to ooze into my romantic life .
i met this girl a couple months back on the facebook group of a college we 're both attending and we struck off really well .
eventually we kinda confessed that we were interested in each other etc ... we both live with our parents but while my family follows quarantine to the teeth hers just kinda lets her go loose and do whatever she pleases .
we want to meet up and take this to the next level but she 's calling me less nowadays and hanging out with her guy friends constantly going on night runs and such .
i wan na give this a chance because i like her but i 'm not feeling the same vibes from her anymore and my stupid caveman brain makes me jealous of these dudes she 's hanging out with when i 'm not even in a real relationship with her .
i 'm considering breaking things off i wo n't be able to see her in real life for a long time anyway and it 's probably better in terms of staying mentally healthy and keeping bad thoughts away .
my heart is telling me to stay but my brain is telling me to go which should i listen to in this situation ?
went to buy vitamin c capsules for my mom who has a slight deficiency and they 've been sold out .

i am an incoming engineering major and was wondering whether taking math 122 and physics 151 at the same time is too much to handle .
the thing i am worried about it the fact that i have 0 experience with physics .
edit physics 151 along with all other classes will apparently be held online .
and die with out anyone what should i do next .
i 'm always amazed at the cosplayers who are really dedicated to their craft and make unbelievable recreations of characters it seems it would be so fun to explore that kind of creativity .
but i 've always wondered what do you actually do ?
i know people can get bored of eachother if they spend every day together and for the last few months we 've been social distancing together but all in all we are in a relationship for about a year and a half .
the thing is the last few months he is completely uninterested in sex with me while i on the other hand could have sex 24/7 if possible and i 'm not bored '' of him .
our sex life now consist of me giving him a blowjob every other day and maybe riding him for a couple of min once a month .
beyond making me feel like shit cause my confidence is taking a massive nose dive due to constant rejection and unwillingness on his part ro start any kind of action i really fricking need sex in a relationship .
we had such an amazing out of this world dynamic there was constant sexual tension and our sex life affected our relationship dynamic in a positive way too .
if i try to initiate hell sometimes even if i make a sexual joke he will get angry and say i 'm putting pressure on him '' and nothing i do or say to reassure him that not everything playful needs to end up in penetration/full on sex helps .
i do n't know what to do i feel so unattractive and frustrated and i 'm tired of sneakily masturbating .
i have no doubt he would give me oral or something to assist me but honestly since he is not into it '' it 's only a turn off cause it feels like he is doing it out of obligation .
i do n't know what to do anymore i have needs but we ca n't even talk about them without him feeling attacked and defensive .
we love each other and we are perfect in almost every other aspect but sex is a big deal for me .

so i 'm thirteen and i started watching a ton of lgbtq content tik tok lol and started questioning my sexuality .
i am a female and have literally only liked two boys ever and used to think that i would never like anyone ever because i was a proud young child .
now i think i like girls too but i do n't know for sure .
i can imagine myself dating a girl and stuff but i can never imagine the feeling .
for example i like this boy right now and i do n't remember how it feels until i 'm with him and it 's like that .
i do n't know how i 'll feel until i 'm with them and i fear that i 'm just saying this for attention .
am i just a weird attention seeking teenager or am i actually bi ?
edit thanks for the advice guys i will proceed with caution thank you
so i got a hifi itch that needs to be scratched budget is 120€-150€ maybe a bit more if it is worth it .
i guess is should start with preference and experience .
i had a few cans by now sennheiser ie80 shure se315 and a ton of cheap 10€-20€ in ears when i was younger .
nowadays i use my sennheiser hd700 but i do n't find the time to sit down and listen for a long time anymore so i want some iems that i can wear for long listening sessions doing chores around the house etc .
my main headphone at the moment are airpods ... and i enjoy the magical ease of use but those are not made for all day listening and i really miss the hifi experience
i lost track of the hifi world about a year ago so i 'm not up to date but i try to catch up .
i would love to just get them on amazon.de massdrop does not ship to germany the last time i tried to order there .
i have an iphone xs so no 3.5mm jack .
joshua valour made a video a few weeks ago saying that the apple lightning to 3.5mm dongle is a really good dac ... like 100 level of good https youtu.be/4jiseo0frgi .
so if i get 3.5mm iems i would use that as my dac/amp are there other good lightning dac/amp 's that are worth the premium over the 10€ dongle ?
the isine from audeze have a lightning cable and get a lot of praise but are out of stock everywhere .
are there other good lightning iems you know of ?
i found 1more triple driver iems never used in the german craigslist '' for 40€ what i found are those narrow neutral inoffensive but great highs .
i think that sound signature is perfect for long listening sessions .
the triples are quite the opposite to my hd700 's hated for the sharpness fatigueing and very wide .
at the 50€ price point are the tin t2 's every person on this planet loves them so those are a safe bet .
i mainly listen to rnb and hiphop old and modern .
maybe a mid forward sound would be interesting too i do appreciate strong punchy low end also not afraid of highs .

i have fare dry skin and i 'm in my early twenties .
i 'm currently using lubriderm daily moisture lotion with spf 15 .
today i had the most insane experience that brought me to tears .
i was escorting a contractor on a taxiway and i see this small animal in the middle of it .
i pull over and walk up to the animal which happens to be a rabbit .
this rabbit had its eyes gouged out was missing patches of fur and was so short of breath it was barley even alive but it was .
i managed to get it to slowly move off the taxiway so that no aircraft suck it into the inlet and cause damage .
i got back into my car and sat there for awhile thinking how much needless suffering there is in the world .
eventually i could n't take it anymore and i walked back to the rabbit and sat next to it .
i talked to it and had said how sorry i was that it was suffering and that it did not deserve the pain it was in .
eventually i decided i should just put it out if it 's misery so i go get a rock and walk up to it .
i stand there for a minute and just before i 'm about to throw this rock down onto it it suddenly springs up and moves away without me making any sound ... keep in mind it 's blind and in very bad shape .
after seeing this i suddenly have this massive awakening and realization that all awareness is from the source and that the rabbit is no different than i .
it is apart of infinite awareness just as i am and it came from that source just as i did .
the rabbit could sense the energy in me had changed and it moved to avoid what was n't it 's time to return to the source .
i do n't think i 'll ever be the same man i was since before this experience and i felt the need to share thanks for reading !
most are but i believe rothman winter is one of the few natural .

i would love to trade the plain wooden shop sign if possible !
i think i tried that once iirc shields do n't affect fall damage it gets directly applied to your health .
can you ask him what timeline he 's ok with moving in together ?
you both need to look at your finances and decide what your goals are and how you 're going to pay for them .
it 's not enough to get married and move in together .
in you situation if the plane is stationary and the engines are not on and the treadmill begins to move backwards does the plane move backwards or stand still ?
if it moves backwards friction is at play and the forward thrust can be overcome with treadmill movement .
if everything is frictionless and the plane stays still when the treadmill moves then the treadmill plays no role whatsoever and has no purpose in the question .
if you have redness i would not use clay masks they will just add to the irritation .
if you wear makeup or spf this might mean a double cleanse if not use a non-stripping cleanser .
also try some products for redness such as azelaic acid my fave or niacinamide .
make sure your skin is plenty hydrated and do n't put anything on it that includes fragrance .

i think we need more language to come out of philosophy and the sciences to better rhetorically argue the nature of consciousness and what well being means for our evolving society for us to progress in this subject .
yta she 's right and you just do n't want to hear it
you are an answer in the same way i am .
deeper could be in what ever way you want to describe as in the persons ideas or feels or the physicality of something .
as in if i dive to the bottom of the ocean i am closer to the surface of the bottom and as i breach that surface i am only closer to the next ... . when someone speaks and you feel them and you see them if you look or feel or hear deeper into what they feel you will see it expressed on their face or in their words or their ideologies .
tomorrow will only ever be an imagination until it is today .
and so it is called morning without the u mourning because you are not invoked in the death of yesterday 's today .
and so we begin a new today every morning of yesterday 's past ... . or passed .

they should be careful or they will end up filing for bankruptcy .

each to their own but the existence of a single bot ruins the entire game for me
granted this part comes down to opinion but i feel like yes may not have been the best example for that last point you made .
close to the edge and gates of delirium are both incredible as you mentioned and awaken is so close to fitting the 16 minutes condition that it might as well be that way and that 's at least in my opinion their best song .
if you do n't like tales that 's understandable but at least to me the revealing science of god and ritual are still awesome even if the other two are a little more forgettable .
additionally there 's mind drive and that that is off of the keys albums and the title suite from fly from here which at least i personally find to be enjoyable .
i guess if you feel otherwise then you might as well just disregard this whole post but at least to me that 's 8 solid songs of that length .
which means they do it a maximum of 9 times .
she said it was because it 's her house and it 's not my place to do something like that in her house .
she said that if i wouldnt have sex in the house why would i do something like that .
bear in mind this is what she was shouting about when she stormed off so i could have heard wrong .
they hike him the ball and he throws it directly at that guy .

my parents put up with a lot of stuff in my bedrooms growing up my parents decorated my first 'big girl ' bedroom whatever i wanted and ended up with cinderella wallpaper matching curtains matching bedsheets which my mother bless her specially ordered from the us were from the uk with 3 lilac walls and some..
when we moved i had a completely nerdy bedroom with posters from the avengers doctor who films video games the whole lot .
as well as having star wars and avengers bedsheets which at nearly 21 years old i still use at university .
personalisation of a bedroom is important to growing up yes kids sometimes want the ugliest things but honestly a child 's bedroom is their space .
i used to play in my bedroom before i went to sleep or i 'd spend hours reading or playing my video games as i got older and i was comfortable in my bedroom if i had a hard day it was my retreat yes my parents owned the house but they let me do that for my space .
i feel that is important to have especially in your younger years .

you have to learn many things and question who you really are .
if you 're prepared for that it can be a very useful time of growth for you .
it 's a waste if you 're not willing to change though .
when experiencing a transition it 's important to be open to becoming a new version of yourself
that would then be pitting guild members against one another for targets rather than encouraging teamwork for full decimation of the other guild .

i mean you 're working specifically with addiction patients .
of course you 're going to see addicted patients .
i absolutely agree that narcotics are being diverted by hcws but it 's not a majority or even substantial minority of them .
while addiction rates among doctors and nurses are much higher than the general population about 15 compared to about 8 it 's still mostly alcohol and stimulants neither of which are coming from the workplace .
we struggle and burn out and turn to substance abuse at an alarming rate .
but the vast majority do n't abuse patients to do it .
edit i should acknowledge my own bias to be fair .
i work in ontario and have never been in a facility from emergency care to retirement homes that did n't have at least an independent double check for all narcotics and waste procedures .
it 's tough to steal narcs when you 'd have to convince a colleague to look the other way .
you know i almost put a clause in about that .

i have met some 15 year olds that i would say are definitely mature enough to decide if they want to have sex or not .
i get your point but brain has n't even fully developed by 15
as others have pointed out 16-year-olds are notorious for having strong opinions and very little control over their emotions .
ultimately yes you 're an adult and capable of making your own decisions .
but it was equally important that you parent her through how to resolve differences when she feels strongly about a topic .
and you completely missed that opportunity and invited her to show herself out .
a better choice would have been asking her to gather resources to back up her claims showing her how to discern reputable sources from propaganda and demonstrating compromise .
yes meat is bad for the environment so try meatless mondays together or similar .
one day a week is n't going to make or break you and would have given you a chance to explore vegan recipes together .
if you can i 'd encourage you to repair what you can with her .
another valuable lesson here is that adults are not infallible .
if you ca n't muster a genuine apology without pointing out how she screwed up at least be honest and share your regret at the lost months without her .
see if she 's willing to discuss the topic calmly .
it 's something she cares deeply about and your seeming not to care pains her .
take an interest even if you ca n't be persuaded to become vegan overnight .
i 'm really rooting for you to work it out .
if you put it in an observer mode you can enter places where they would not need to exist or for example the high sky without need .

when you call to schedule your appointment ask if she rents crinoline slips and if not you can find them online

i think what happens is it feels like to those type of people that you are leaving your culture behind .
food can be a part of culture just like music and clothing so that 's why older generations are always offended when the next generation want to dress different and listen to different music .
when i first went vegan i stopped telling people because some people would get offended at just mentioning it .
then they would want to get in to a big debate when all i wanted to do was eat in quite .

to be honest when i consider that daenerys was the last targaryen and also planned to break a wheel she herself said targaryen was a spoke on i truly expected her to be the last queen whose rule laid the groundwork for the kind of people rule themselves setup she left in essos .
but frankly i do n't think any of them could be a good king or queen because it 's never so simple .
all the details all the mistakes everything it 'll make you great to some and awful to others .
but my point is that unlike dany and jon whose struggles with ruling was shown in detail over a few years sansa does not have such a storyline .
so i have less certainty that she or bran would be good leaders at all .
the show seemed to expect us to accept that their coronation was a good thing .
the point i took away from the show was that it 's never that simple .

i play on both pc and ps4 though mostly on pc and i think the jump from 60hz to 144hz—for fps games—was bigger than upgrading my gpu to the latest gen .
i do n't think the jump from 144hz to 240hz is as big as some people say but 60 144 i can really feel .
i think linus or some other yter did a video about it using pro gamers .
there is a pretty distinct different in fps games at least .
the gap is certainly closing and i 'd argue mid range pcs and the ps5 are likely even in processing power and the ps5 will be a couple hundred dollars cheaper .
definitely excited to see what will come next with it .

if you play that much per league then that 's great for you .
i have certainly never bothered to get 36 challenges and could n't care less about trying .
nobody is going to play standard because the league is n't about challenges no league has been and no league ever will be the league is always about new league content .
there is zero purpose to playing the game again we 've already finished dozens and dozens of times without new content for the majority of players the only reason they come back at all each time is because there 's new content .
this is why they had some of their best player retention ever when they changed up the end game for that league it was new .
it 's no longer new and it 's vastly more of a timesink than how the atlas was previously to progress to the end boss with the addition of a whole bunch of micromanagement and inability to simply run any maps you might find instantly like before unless you sacrifice actual progression to play that way .
i dunno how you think that players wanting to reach a8 in a new league in the same length of time they could reach uber elder before is somehow a controversial or wrong view lol .
if i could get some good seeds i 'd have no problem
i recently acquired this vintage tudor prince-quartz oysterdate ref 91520 34mm grey rare dial .
i have worn it ever since i purchased it about 2 months ago and fell in love with it .
i decided to give up the tudor along with a free vintage seiko champion that has been sitting in my desk for a while now because i want to fund another watch .
the tudor will come with its original box no papers and with one extra link .
the claps/buckle are is very adjustable which makes it easier to adjust it to your liking .
billy blue is darker than alex blue if my memory is correct
yeah but the hubble telescope will still block your view .
i used to exercise with the intention of making myself really sore the next day .
but i clean them very frequent once a week .
which is why i said he 's slightly possessed by the real culprit . ''
if his np steals loot from the enemy i 'd bring him along every time .
i dont either because subs are dedicated to specific subjects .
should they as apolitical '' communication sites also be allowed to ban certain kinds of speech ?
it never ceases to amaze me how lib-left '' if not supporting outright censorship will support privatized censorship of monopolized communication platforms .
i always try to remind people that its all about owning and silencing the nazis '' until eat the rich '' and any other form of communism/socialism/tax on the wealthy is also a bannable offense in their tos .
not just a great job getting his weight up and his coat shiny but he is standing so confident and sure of himself .
he looks like a very happy and safe little guy compared to the top pic .
it 's reasonable to try to believe as many true things as possible and as few false .
most of us generally think we know true things already if we did n't think we were right we would n't think the things we do .
claims that religious people have more claim to any special privilege on the basis of their unquestioning loyalty to a particular church or doctrine than others is simply false and derogatory towards non-believers .
i would suggest that people seeking out a particular experience might reasonably expect to find it more reliably than people who purposefully avoid it though .
science has infrastructure for falsifiability and evidential merit and evidential methodologies for repeatability religion and spirituality do not have the same infrastructures .
indeed it seems more likely the case that there will some form of the opposite like you would go to hell for even questioning them or even talking to someone of a different belief set .
you might hope that people have some internal process for recognizing the falsity of a hopelessly corrupt or evil or just plain ridiculous group but this does not appear to be true across the board .
it seems people are not taught to think for themselves generally .
the fact that you think you know right from wrong as a categorical assessment just means you will be hiding from yourself those moments when you have convinced yourself that wrong is right or when someone or something else has convinced you .
i see this all the time it 's not limited to religious or spiritual people .
most people who say they started as an atheist and then moved to being religious never had a good actual foundation of why they were an atheist .
they were just an atheist because they did n't bother to think about it most of the time or did n't want to or did n't like to .
it 's brutally presumptuous on both of our parts but it 's also my current understanding .
we ca n't even know if our concept of the spiritual is the same as the person that one would try to teach how to have a spiritual experience because you ca n't even define it you just say you 'll know it when you feel it which means everybody has named whatever they feel counts as spiritual as spiritual .
it is biasing you to interpret your experience as spiritual so you will find an experience to name that .
i would again bring up the other experiences that i mentioned previously such as love which i never experienced the same way twice and have no way of identifying if someone else experiences it the same way .
it appears to me that people do n't and it makes total sense to me that they would n't because we do n't have the same history or genes or brains or other biology .
you can not tie any actual material causal effect to that magic wand i had prevously mentioned .
one of the problems with the secret '' is that many people are convinced that it is purely the belief that allows for the effect .
it convinces you to wish for them not to strive to achieve them .
it should be define something you wish to achieve then move forward and act towards it .
my only point of difference here compared to what you wrote but that i suspect you would also agree with is to also believe that you will achieve it .
decide that you will so that nothing can stop you .
see every obstacle as an opportunity for growth which thereby improves your ability to achieve it .
anyways yes it is a deceptive book that is selling wishful thinking .
it seems like many forms of religion do the same damn thing including most forms of christianity though it goes against what is actually in the bible from my perspective .
i guess it 's an easier message to sell saying that you do n't actually have to do the work .
i 'm out of time to write more tonight i will be back soon with some things a little less buttery .
so i dont get the alibaba i got the fillings and flavors if you call it like that what am i supposed to look for next ?
i just finished my first piece using white charcoal on black paper it was fun experimenting with it .

an option to consider would be to get them somewhere they can rest and give their bodies their best chance to fight this .
the fatality rate for people in their age group is still 10 .
they should wear masks and be in a ventilated environment .
if you can find someone to take care of them and keep them comfortable i think the odds will be as good as anything else .
making them comfortable might be the best thing you can do .
having them setup so they can talk to you or available caretakers by phone .
there is n't really a treatment for the virus .
i would just note that if they should probably be laying on their stomachs .
it would be good to have a mouth guard or something to clamp their teeth on if they get the chills .
i am not a doctor but that is what i would be considering .
in ny at least most people who needed a respirator still died .
i would not stress them trying to get them to a place with available respirators .
i would consider rest and comfort a safer bet .
first off i can identify myself as whatever i want .
second did n't know that was a thing that people are getting worked up over other making up identities .
lol so take your sensitive ass elsewhere and learn to laugh a little .
so in those 1000 days the hair can grow to about 18 inches—which does seem short it 's only about armpit length .
however 100 is the high end of normal 50 is the low end based on quick googling i do n't know exactly how accurate that number is but seems like a reasonable ballpark .
so then you 'd have 2000 days of growth and the hair could grow to 36 inches .
on me that 's classic length bottom of the butt which is within the realm of normal terminal lengths .
of course people vary a lot so there are outliers .
i 've seen photos of people with longer than floor length hair they must have a very long growing phase indeed .

é completamente normal se sentir atraído por personagens seja de live-actions de animes de games ou o que quer que seja .
a ideia por trás do design atraente seja de uma forma sensualizada ou na maior inocência de grande parte dos personagens de animes é justamente essa fazer com que o público se sinta atraído e goste de ver esses personagens .
eu mesmo já tive crushes em algumas personagens de animes durante minha adolescência .
maaaaas como sabemos que é impossível sequer sonhar com interagir com um ser que não existe a melhor forma que eu vi de saciar isso era ler fanfictions com elementos de romance bem definidos .
eis um exemplo eu tinha mó crush na ryuko matoi de kill la kill logo que o anime saiu .
tinha ela até de papel de parede do meu celular haha !
e depois que o anime acabou senti falta da personagem dela e senti que ela merecia mais do que ela obteve no desfecho da obra .
às vezes você se identifica tanto com um personagem que parece que ele foi parte da sua vida você entende não é ?
enfim um dia tive a ideia de procurar fanfics de kill la kill e encontrei uma que recontava toda a história de kill la kill mas introduzia um personagem original masculino desde o início da obra que passava a ser um co-protagonista com seu próprio background e tals .
e fazia par romântico com a ryuko nesse universo .
comecei a ler pensando que ia ser mais um daqueles oc gary stu '' que não iriam fazer um personagem digno de pegar a minha waifu participar da história mas esse personagem acabou sendo tão bem escrito que eu passei a me identificar com ele muito mais do que com a ryuko que em termos de personalidade era muito diferente de mim como pessoa então passei a shipar os dois forte .
a história ficou cada vez melhor apesar de seguir nos moldes do original com algumas mudanças bem colocadas aqui e ali e o final foi muito bom .
quando eu terminei de assistir kill la kill me senti meio triste .
não vou dar spoilers mas o final foi apesar de muito bom meio agridoce .
ok aí vai um pequeno spoiler pra entender o contexto do que vou dizer a ryuko tem de abrir mão de algo muito precioso e parece que o buraco que fica nela nunca mais vai ser preenchido e não há ninguém ao redor dela que entenda como é isso .
na fanfiction ela ainda perdia aquilo mas havia alguém capaz de entender como ela se sentia por ter passado por algo bem parecido .
e esse alguém justamente é quem havia se tornado a pessoa mais importante pra ela e que seguia junto com ela no seu futuro .
ah e na pior das hipóteses tem sempre as fanfictions '' male reader x personagem '' e '' female reader x personagem '' .
não tenho experiência com isso mas quem sabe é o que você tá procurando ?

sounds like he was pissed someone cared enough to ask that question and got her another ring to manipulate her into seeing you as the bad guy .
this situation sounds like a major disaster in the making and you 're probably better off being distanced from her .

i feel like you are probably bi-polar and unfortunately one of the only ways that you can correct those feelings and actions is therapy or meditation or both .
so as soon as you can get into see someone definitely do that
in the mean time try to be aware of what you 're feeling and how you 're acting and when you start to get upset create some sort of coping mechanism meditating for a couple minutes breathing techniques thinking about how this behavior affected you last time it happened etc .
being mindful of your actions and emotions and finding triggers or patterns and then creating coping mechanisms is a great start .
i personally have ocd and generalized aniexty disorder and i know how upsetting it can be to let your emotions get the best of you and then regret it later so be mindful be kind to yourself and be patient because it gets better !
its going to cause so much resentment and will bite him in the ass !

benjamin/bennywas born in 1994 so he was already and old man by the time i came around in 2001 but he successfully lived to the age of 19 where he died of like 14 kinds of cancers in 2013. benny was a black lab and he was very tender and gentle .
i remember as a kid i would put cowboy hats on him and he 'd keep them on till they fell off .
the day he died i was very very sad and he was in a lot of pain leading up to that point .

these days i 35m am learning more and more about just how introverted i am .
like many others in this subreddit i have spent a lot of effort trying to be more social and even getting really good '' at it energetic and likeable .
it has taken me a long time to start accepting myself for who i am .
i am in a loving relationship with my partner 35f .
we encourage each other to be exactly who we are and try to help each other on this path .
we are living together and we make a conscious effort to give each other space and support to be who we are and do what we need/want to do .
lately we have been openly discussing the topic of children .
she wants children and her biological clock is indeed ticking .
one of them is that i suspect i do n't have space for another person in my life .
i am afraid i will end up being constantly psychologically drained by relating to and taking care of another person most of my waking hours .
the other day at work i was in meetings for three hours usually i work mostly on my own .
i spent the entire evening exhausted on the verge of tears because i was so drained .
me and my partner find ways to be alone together and it even feels good .
but with a child constantly requiring care and attention.. ?
being social can be very costly to me and if i do it too much i just spend the rest of my time recovering .
with little or no time left for what i really want .
writing meditating gardening playing music reading gathering herbs in the forest.. you know.. alone stuff .
spending my life only in social '' and recovery '' mode sounds like hell to me .
maybe my fears are unfounded and stand in the way of something really beautiful and meaningful .
so i want to ask the parents of this subreddit
how do you manage being an introverted parent without losing yourself in the everyday hustle and bustle of parenthood ?
is there anything i should consider/read/know before deciding to have/do n't have a child ?

so it 's been two days since watching that masterpiece and yesterday was horrible but today i feel much better .
so it 's true that it does have a lasting effect ranging differently on others .
i 'm able to truly appreciate the masterpiece that is the film for its colours outfits visuals ext .
and yes i still feel that melancholy feeling but it 's not so painful or heartbreaking today .
thank you to everyone who commented on the last post and a user duneddin sorry i 'm brand new to this app i 'm not sure how to mention people lol said the feeling was a welsh word called hiraeth .
i 'm first language welsh and the word is one of the only welsh words which is unable to be translated to the english .
it 's a longing feeling of nostalgia of sorts and it can be longing for anything someone something or even something you have n't experienced though it tends to be longing for something in the past .
this word fits perfectly to describe i feel most peoples feelings for the film .
if you 're really struggling after the rollercoaster that is cmbyn i just tried to realize why it affected me so much acknowledge it and listen to 10 hours of visions of gideon and cry .
it sort of drained me in a good way and hopefully it will help some of you too !
i 've decided not to rewatch the film just yet as i do n't want to reopen feelings or ruin the experience .
so i 've decided in a few days to read and finish the book and then rewatch the film .
but it cant be game of the year if xbox switch and pc cant play it and voting for it just shows a complete bias unless you also own the nextest xbox console and a pc .
some are saying got will be game if the year but again another ps exclusive .
cyberpunk will easily beat both since it can actually be played by 3 out of 4 platforms .
so trying to find a video of a school shooting .
i think it was columbine but basically they reenacted it and filmed it from cctv cameras with audio .
it seems that all corona subreddits are geared toward fearmongering about this not very dangerous virus i 'm trying to find an alternative community .
i dont think its good of a game if a match is decided on whose got a herald on their team .
i can take wasps locusts heck even an indominus can be countered because its slow and has a hittable head .
but herald just sits outside the base wall killing everyone and clearing the map and good luck getting close to it .
any dino in the game has a reliable way to counter it except herald which needs a pack of dinos just to take it down .

req 1750 bonner springs ks country 1st of the year 2018 paypal
i have made a couple request here lately but have been able to get by until i started my new job .
i have a loan right now that i am paying on and have made all payments prior to today as you can see in the thread as he post my payments .
i am finally starting to catch up so i went from requesting 3500 to 1750 .
i am here today to try to consolidate all my loans into one once again .
i am catching up but just transitioned to a new job and of course started on the week they get paid so i will not be paid for two weeks .
just found out taht so thats why i am here .
part of this money will be used to repay the current loan i have out and the rest will be used to pay bills and a loan so i dont accrue any late fees and get behind again .
also some will help with gas to get to work for the next 2 weeks until i get paid again .
add you on facebook and send my state issued id .
i 'm looking to pay about 500 a month or so until this is paid off .
any questions or comments feel free to pm me .
edit i forgot to add i prefer to pay a little amount that we agree upon every two weeks .
makes it less risk for both you and i .

back before i took estrogen i was a self harming buffoon and took a lot of efforts to punish myself for anything .
... and then i found hrt which helped me out of that mindset giving me a reason to like my body and treat it fairly .
only fucking issue is the scars carried from that old life and now the breasts that i love so much the ones that are growing into something that makes me so happy grew deformed off the jump with six keloids riddling my upper chest .
its like ... my life is a fucking joke i swear to god i ca n't just have this one thing that makes me happy it has to be tainted by my idiotic impulsive decisions .
and i 've already looked into treatment all possibilities result in a dead-end of maybe they 'll be removed and stay dormant .
there is no point to this post i just feel like fucking pagliacci with this whole circus act someone up there is writing my life with alan moore or some tragedy-dredging pain fetishist .
... anyway if there 's anyone who 's reading this who wants to transition or take hormones but struggles with self-harm get help right the fuck now before you damage yourself for life .
hey so i have gotten back into mw recently and i 'm playing warzone but i do n't have anyone to play with .

have built many pcs in the past but this is my 1st for a good 5 years and i 'm having issues before i 've even started .
i 'm building a pc for my sons 11th birthday on saturday and i ca n't even get anything to display .
parts are listed at the bottom of this post but i 've put everything together using the working psu from the machine i intend to replace with this one .
my issue is that the pc powers on but i get no beep errors and no display .
i 've checked and confirmed multiple times that all power cables are connected securely and correctly .
i 've removed the ram and reseated in both available slots .
i also tried booting without the ram in still no beeps .
i 've tried connecting to the vga dvi hdmi onboard to multiple working monitors each time i get no display .
all cables are working fine when tested to connect my pc to monitors .
i 've reset cmos by removing battery and powering on .
the only display on the board itself is a bright white led .
i have n't flashed bios yet but it 's getting late so that 's going to be something to try tomorrow .
hopefully i 'm missing something ridiculously obvious and i can get this working for his birthday on saturday !
i would consider myself agnostic but i do n't think there 's any sort of actual entity .
in my opinion if there is some outside force controlling everything it 's probably some sort of like energy .
but sometimes i see people who follow a religion and go to church/mosque/etc the good religious people haha not the batshit crazy ones and i wish i did too .
i find the idea comforting and i like the idea of having that community .
i do n't really know why i was n't raised religious and both my parents are atheists .
but i ca n't believe in something like god and the bible because it 's just ridiculous

we all have those days or weeks when we look back fondly on past loves and when we miss the memories of relationships we were able to make with another but the timing was wrong or circumstances arose and it ended .
of course there are also times when we reflect on our biggest idiot decisions and how they fucked with our emotional and physical well being long after the relationship ended .
and while these guys pretty unforgivably fucked up an attempted nirvana cover recently this song of theirs sums up that god that sucked so bad '' feeling better than most .

so we 're planning to take 1-p_lsd with some of my friends two of them are already experimented with the substance but the two other have never tried it .
i 've took 100ug myself once and it was a really good experience .
so my inexperienced friends would like to discover the wonders of lsd and i 'm wondering what dose we should give them because we plan to take 200ug my others friend have already took 200ug so they are confident but i do n't know if 200ug is n't a bit intense for a first experience .
so i would like to have opinions on that matter knowing that we 'll all be together and everything is ok to give them 200ug or is it a bit too much for a first time ?
i took vhdl this semester and i have an assignment for the end of the semester .
my project requires me to design a variable illumination system using the pwm pulse width modulation technique .
the system uses 8 different leds and has 3 working modes
manual the system takes as an 8-bit input the value of the intensity of the leds
test each led pulses from minimum to maximum value in a specific interval of time led 1 1second led 2 2 seconds etc .
auto the system takes as input a number of seconds 0-8 and pulses all leds in that period of time .
so far i 've accomplished to make some components that will help me .
i 've implemented a pwm module component which takes as input the duty cycle value between 0 and 255 and a clock signal and outputs a signal with the necessary duty cycle .
i also have implemented a regular up counter and a modified reversible counter which counts from min to max value and back .
i 've tried assembling some of these components in order to implement the auto working mode but got hard stuck .
i tried using a counter to lower the default 100 mhz frequency of the board in order to use it with the reversible counter so that i can generate in the given interval of time the 0-255-0 values that would later go to the pwm module .
if it helps i will provide some code to show my errors .
what i need is someone who knows vhdl who can guide me through what i 'm doing wrong and possibly help me in the following days should any more questions arise .
it 's too easy for the commander to just hover the whole match and be impervious to pretty much every troop .
i believe a time limit of 30 seconds would be much more appropriate with a aoe attack at the end as it currently is .

i have some poffins saved on my backpack but would be a pity wasting one of them if they do n't stack !

i 've swapped a fixed cog for a freewheel so naturally the chain is very slightly out of line with the chainring by maybe 3-5mm not entirely sure .
i feel like it 's probably not a huge deal as teeth are mostly centered coming in and out of the chain when i pedal but it kinda bothers me anyway .
what should i do without having to redo the wheel ?
i made a post a while ago asking people how the would have rebooted ds1 .
i would add more humanoid enemies that are more engaging to fight than those stupid demon statues .
there are even some enemies in the game files that were supposed to be added here but for some reason they removed them .
on a similar note remove those fucking clams in crystal cave .
they are completely out of place and just trigger me .
instead of nito being that slow-ass sponge with a bunch of skellies to do the dirty work for him i would change it a bit .
like the area is pitch-black and there are many tunnels and you do n't know where he could be coming from .
he sometimes reaches out and attacks you only to go back in .
and if you have a light source you can go in the tunnels at your own risk because there will be an army of skello 's waiting for you there .
and bed of chaos give her a bunch of new attacks with her arms and make the ground not break .
and whenever you reach one of the sides a witch npc with low health will attack you and you have to kill her .
kill both and you can go in the middle .
remove some of the bonfires in these areas but make all of them warpable .
like you select the warp option you have a list of all the areas you 've visited and you can select an area and then select which bonfire of that area you want to warp to .
also add omni-directional rolling becoz that kills a bit of my love for the combat in dis game
my ws made the comment this morning that i 'm sorry it took having an affair for me to realize i want this commitment.
i was n't enough to prevent you from cheating and it took someone else to show you that i 'm worthwhile .
i was six months pregnant with our second child when i discovered the affair in march of last year .
were your unborn child and fiancé not enough to commit to ?
i confidently know my own worth and yet this comment makes me feel worthless .
i started getting friendly with these kittens outdoors and then i loved them and begged for catfood for them from my parents so they could be like proper household cats '' they slept in my lap and always loved me but i did n't give water i did n't deem it essential as i thought they could do fine without it and probably find it easily i barely gave them catfood sometimes they 'd beg on the window but i was too lazy so i would give a biscuit instead sometimes i 'd properly feed them and make sure to play enough but most of the time i just said i would play later or maybe i 'd only give water if i gave them meat that had something spicy on it i wasnt giving spicy stuff just bits of leftover spicy chicken or something .
soon most of the cats left the house and came very rarely and my parents said that they ca n't bring catfood for animals they did n't even want here so we did n't really have food for them so whenever they 'd meow for something i would say i 'll come outside later even though i knew they wanted food and not attention and i 'd just pet them through the window they were always dirty and very thin my mother would say that cats can hunt and they 'll be fine so i would give biscuits because that was the only thing they 'd be able to eat in our fridge i 'd just pet them they need to hunt and i ca n't make them dependant on me to not feel guilty later i decided on giving milk every morning and always making sure they 'd get leftovers they could eat my family members usually gave them anyway but i tried to add more stuff in and make sure theyd get it i still did n't gave water though because i did n't think it was that important one day we went on family vacation except some adults were gon na stay behind i thought that the family members would usually give leftovers but when i came back i was feeling sick and i pet her one last time before finding her dead they probably did feed her but she was weak and she still died she loved me so much and loved sleeping on my lap

you were out at your favorite bar on a pretty average date with your boyfriend when you see me your ex .
this used to be our favorite place before you moved and our relationship ended .
somewhere along the line maybe when you 'd been drinking you let it slip that i was a better lover than him by a lot .
interestingly he seemed to really be interested and asked for more details .
he even asked if you had pictures of course you had n't gotten rid of those nudes i sent you .
he looked at them shocked at the size and beauty of my shaft .
he 's never acted bi or even mentioned it but that night he fucked you harder than ever before .
and now here you are and he 's suggesting the two of you go over and talk to me .
and you 're not sure where it might lead after that .
so we could start with the initial conversation where you and/or he come on to me .
it should definitely be that he wants you to suck me off and fuck me he 's going to watch .
but he 's just so interested he has to watch closer and then eventually participate .
i could play it not as your ex and i 'm open to other suggestions so feel free to ask !
i do n't want him to be bi but maybe my cock turns him into a cocksucker .
i do n't want a mfm threesome but i will consider it .

me 17m and my girlfriend 17f have been together for 14 months .
10 days ago my girlfriend 's sister unexpectedly died .
its really difficult and confusing but i 'm trying my best to help her however i can .
my girlfriend has always said cuddling comforts her so the past week i have been going over to cuddle her for around 6 hours every day .
i 've also been sleeping in her bed and cuddling with her all night .
this was all requested by her she says its helping a lot and her parents are ok with it .
we have n't done anything sexual this past week except for a little kissing and thats ok with me .
prior to all this we had n't done much sexually .
i have n't seen the bottom half of her body fully naked no oral sex on her yet etc .
she said she wanted to take that stuff slowly and was n't ready for sex just 3 weeks ago .
but a few days ago she told me she wants to come to my house and have sex with me .
she has said everyday since that she really wants to .
under normal circumstances i would have had no hesitations .
i 'm not even sure if she 's in the right frame of mind to be able to consent to that .
she changed her mind about having sex in a matter of weeks .
i love her and do n't want to take advantage of her .
but i also do n't want to hurt her more by rejecting her even by explaining my reasoning .
its possible that this is an extension of her getting comfort out of us cuddling but does that make this wrong ?
should i wait longer to see if she still feels the same way ?
how would i wait longer without hurting her more or making her feel rejected ?

every time i look back at those scrapped fics i just miss them .
i would make a second attempt at both of the recent au projects i attempted but i already have a third that is actually working and one content creator can not be running three aus at once if they are to post on tumblr .

not sure how they 're gon na handle the live action version .
i have n't done a lot of these pickups before and the only one i 've done before was very prompt so i think my confusion was that i thought that the time slot was for them to have the order ready and me to show up .
so like they had to have the order ready in the time slot and then i had to be there in the time slot .
i did n't think it was that i had to show up in the time slot and then they had until the end of the time slot to bring it to me .
but i guess i 'm mistaken and i 'll take that into account in the future .
sounds awesome i 'll have to look into it for sure .

i almost do n't believe this is real as you made a throwaway account just to post this insanity .
maybe cover some of the different kinks around the world ?
i feel like it would have been cool for them to appear at least once but not too many times as those episodes normally result in a ‘how to defeat the borg ' technobabble episode .
however similar character stories about war can be done using the dominion so the borg are unnecessary here .
my favourite part of ds9 is how character-driven it is so that should be what the hypothetical borg episodes focus on e.g .
sisko gets carried away trying to get revenge though janeway and picard both already had those .
it would have been interesting to see how various characters/societies dealt with the borg threat though again it would n't have been much different to the same angle but with the dominion .
i 'd also have loved to have seen a dominion v borg episode and parallels getting drawn between them but because the borg are so ... determined ?
that probably would have become an ongoing thing unless one is defeated entirely which would take away from the rest of the series .
personally i believe that all religions have a partial truth to them at least .
i do n't think that any religion has the complete truth we can only find that in ourselves .
we all just try to put it into a way that we understand .
if what you believe feels right to you then you definitely have a sense of truth about it besides it 's just a manifestation of something that we just ca n't really put words to so it 's really just our own interpretation of the same energy we all feel .

i feel like i see reptomancer mentioned the most as the act 3 runkiller .
but after like 100 hours in this game nemesis in my most loathed to see act 3 elite .
talking head is just a scaling check and always follows a really simple pattern .
reptomancer is scary no doubt but at least gives you a relatively non-scary turn 1 and you really should n't have gotten to act 3 in the first place without adequate aoe .
nemesis is a consistency check that also further enables inconsistency in your deck by giving you burns .
and there is n't an easy way of simply adding consistency to ones deck where as with the other 2 elites adding a catalyst or corpse explosion respectively will often largely suffice .
nemesis is just so random and you can screwed so hard by rng in so many different ways .
the worst of which is that he can just randomly decide to attack for 45 pretty much at any point which is just insane damage .
automaton 's massive hyperbeam attack that literally leaves him stunned for a turn as a drawback on lower ascension hits for 51 this is literally that with no stun afterwards no warning just 6 less damage .
i never feel confident in that fight unless i am nearly full health even with a strong deck because of the amount of times i 've gotten screwed by poor card draw on intangible turns .
not exactly sure why the timespan is relevant to the cost .
if anything it would be cheaper less money you 'd have to pay salaried researchers .
it 'll most likely go to shit once pcm is banned cuz the mods are librights and librights are shit at everything they do .

you might be putting bandaid on the immediate problem but that disrespect and lack of understanding each other could develop somewhere else .

try and come to an understanding and solution together it 's good practice for everything else in life .

even on top of the bohndary wire in one case no problem so far .
perhaps a virtual meeting is a little ridiculous but from experience city dogs works very hard to make sure that a dog is going to the right home and that rehoming does n't occur .
in more normal times a potential adopter has to meet the dog to make sure that the vibe is ok before the dog is formally adopted but that might not be possible now .
honestly if you like the dog i 'd just go with the virtual meeting .
i 'm not available most of the time but if you need help on a particular boss or the cathedral of the sacred blood hit me up .
i have not gone through this so unfortunately i can not answer any of your questions but i wanted to chime in to you let you know that your concerns and feelings are valid .
what has happened has been cataclysmic to your relationship as two people as well as your outlook on life as an individual .
i think it might be helpful to mention that a lot of these issues are not bbn lack and white it isnt wedding or forever in bf/gf status you could be domestic partners and do without a wedding or legal marriage but still be together and committed and be a working unit .
it also doesnt have to be kids right now or kids never like you said you can spend years traveling and learning to love each other again and adopt later on down the road .
i think tension can arise from people feeling like they have to have a strict position on a topic and not seeing the grey area in between where there are options for collaboration not compromise .
with compromise both parties are giving something up to meet in the middle but with collaboration two parties are coming together to make something new .
maybe talking to him about how you two can collaborate to build a life together day by day will relieve some of the pressure of having to compromise for plans years in the future ?

it is no longer the blockbuster series like it was for the halo 2 and halo 3 launch but both 4 and 5 did more sales opening week than those games .
today you need multi platform to hit the mega numbers and maybe infinite can come close .
but anyone who acts like halo is n't still a prestige series is nuts .
halo 4 has a pretty good story halo 5 has the best mp in the series .
if 343 can work itself out maybe infinite can finally be the return to form we need
i miss old style bowling alleys like in the big lebowski .
oh there is a very big change going from the a2 to a brake like the j-comp or the cookie cutter .
this happened to me two days ago except my dad was n't drunk and he did n't know i was high
yeah i 'm familiar with all that but you treat the 10pm thing as if he just phoned up two judges .
that 's not how the events occurred based off the documentation .
first off becerra was n't going to be made a fool of again after the back and forth during freedom week in duncan v becerra he was pretty caught off guard by benitez 's decision last time but this time he used the 9 months or whatever to as far as i can tell prepare a draft of his opposition to benitez 's expected ruling ahead of time so that he could respond as quickly as possible .
i 'm going to do a timeline though this is my notice where i say i 'm totally not a lawyer .
sidenote afaik 9th southern district 9sd only datestamps while 9th court of appeals 9ca timestamps so 9sd times are estimated .
around 11:30am becerra files a motion to stay pending appeal decision https michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-24-defendants-mtn-to-stay-order-granting-mpi.pdf .
becerra gives 3pm deadline until they file a stay request with court of appeals .
just before 3:00pm benitez denies motion to stay https michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-24-order-denying-defendants-mtn-to-stay.pdf .
sometime around 4:00pm becerra files a notice of appeal with sd https michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-24-defendants-ntc-of-appeal.pdf .
appeal is docketed in 9ca at 4:20pm https www.courtlistener.com/docket/27993/kim-rhode-v-xavier-becerra .
6:32pm https www.courtlistener.com/docket/27993/kim-rhode-v-xavier-becerra becerra files an emergency motion to stay injunction pending appeal decision https michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-24-emergency-mtn-to-stay-prelim.-injunction-order-pending-appeal.pdf .
however as indicated in question 3 on page 5 the 9ca staff were notified earlier .
the preliminary injunction was issued on april 23 2020 .
the attorney general this emergency motion on april 24 2020 .
i notified the ninth circuit court staff by voicemail and e-mail prior to filing this emergency motion .
so we know that the 9ca staff was already aware that an emergency motion was coming earlier in the day .
they likely notified the sitting motions panel that becerra was in full-charge panic mode and was going to file sometime tonight .
if you read frap 27-3 http cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/rules.htm pid0e0a50ha which is from a court rulebook of sorts they explicitly advise those making emergency motions to notify everyone and file as soon as is practicably possible .
it lists the contact telephone number and email for the emergency motions unit .
9:46pm https www.courtlistener.com/docket/27993/kim-rhode-v-xavier-becerra 2 out of 3 of the sitting motions panel https www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/motionspanel.php judges which rotates every month for april it was murguia owens and bennet issues an administrative stay https michellawyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-24-order-granting-stay-on-prelim.-injunction.pdf on the injunction pending a full ruling by the motions panel on the emergency stay request .
to understand the administrative stay you have to look at the 9ca general orders http cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/general_orders/general 20orders.pdf which beside 9ca frap http cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/rules_toc.htm is the other rulebook for the court .
there were three reasons that this was most likely done .
http cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/general_orders/general 20orders.pdf it states that judges on motions duty may treat an emergency motion as requesting temporary relief until them motions panel can fully consider the merits of the motion should the emergency motion request relief be granted in less than 48 hours becerra requested it immediately '' .
that 's exactly what they did by issuing an administrative stay .
regarding only 2 of 3 judges signing general orders 6.4.b .
http cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/general_orders/general 20orders.pdf further states that a single judge may issue such an order granting/denying temporary relief if no other judge on motions duty is available and if one or more other judges are available then they only need concurrence of one other judge to handle such a motion .
the judge missing from the order owens did n't really need to be there and probably did n't bother signing the order that night .
regarding administrative stay vs emergency stay apart from that benitez 's injunction is 120 pages needing to be reviewed and it 's late in the day before the court has notice general orders 6.4.a .
http cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/uploads/rules/general_orders/general 20orders.pdf makes it clear that this panel would n't even by default make a full decision on this emergency motion because it states that if the deadline which by default is 10 days for filing a response is within three business days of the end of the month then the motion will instead be presented to the following month 's panel unless the current motions panel filed an order because they really wanted to handle it they did n't .
thus the motion sat around for the rest of april until it was handed off to may 's motion panel .
as a sidenote it 's suggested that emergency motions are ones that need relief in 21 days or less and because of the transfer of the motion that means that in theory it took longer to answer apart from the obvious dissent issued in the decision which took longer to write .
what i 'm getting at here aka in conclusion the way the administrative stay was handled even at 10pm seems to be nothing special while it seems like people want to liken it to affordable healthcare act being passed in the middle of the night '' .
a review of the events do not support this .
becerra is a shitlord of highest order but him being a shitlord has nothing to do with mustache twirling schemes but instead the most bad faith legal arguments and having the power of state backing them .
i had an effort thread partway done about what i read on how this works and a lot of this was part of it but woof this 2-1 ruling .
i 'm working on 100 ing my hero mode file and that yellow cup circuit race and the green cup city outskirts circuit race are my only two non-gold races .
it 's a genuine struggle to place above 4th in either of them ...
i 'm gon na keep trying til i have enough orbs to buy all the secrets i have left for trophy hunting then call it quits 😂
you can do it and you 're gon na have fruits galore before you know it !
used to work at one that was opening but they were assholes .
miracle shots lucky hios and losing streaks will always happen to everyone .
yes it 's particularly annoying when you lose to a donkey but it 's not really their fault .
the only way to maintain a high win rate in the early tours is to climb as slow as possible and maintain minimum trophy count .
however whilst this strategy will work up to t7 the win rate will then start to flatten out as you will encounter much tougher opponents and big money spenders .
but if you 've accumulated a large number of wins already then your average win rate wo n't drop by much and your total earnings will spike up .
really depends on you goals at the end of the day .
either way it 's only a game so enjoy !
you are actually five years old are n't you .
you made a post about how telecasters argueably one of the greatest guitars of all time is bad .
maybe you 've been playing for a week or you are the retard .
we 've had almost no community spread the majority of cases have come from 16 i think ?
major clusters that were all from before the lockdown .
we 've had 1 confirmed case in the last 4 days .
at this point i 'd be very surprised if we do have a spike after lockdown seems like the only way it 'd really happen is if we get imported cases but even then there 's an enforced quarantine period of 2 weeks so it would be unlikely that it could spread further .

do n't do one for the sec please i already know we 're historically bad
the archvile actually only summons other demons because he 's actively trying to set up a bomb-ass pizza party for them all and he only attacks us because this is like the eighteenth time we 've showed up without an invitation and at this point we 're violently violating the restraining order he had to set up .
edit oh and all of the power ups are also magic pizza .
they are n't actually even spherical they just appear that way due to an arcane property that causes any who view them to see the pizza from a top-down perspective so that they might witness the weirdly-colored-cheesy-goodness of the pie at any angle .
one more thing when the archvile eventually summons three marauders that 's actually him finally calling the cops on your ass to detain you and enforce that restraining order .
this is a major problem that we need to work on .
as the price of living increases people have less babies and less people pay taxes
when they went from funny casual gaming to complaining about politics .
not like just their opinion but getting mad at others and attacking their political views .
it was all they did after while and it became super toxic .
just out of the blue saying o i prayed about this and it is right .
back in early 2015 my best friend a tech professional was trying his best to explain to us his group of friends bitcoin and the technology behind it .
he was absolutely convinced that it would be the next big thing and was doing his best to recommend us to invest .
the rest of us non-tech dudes laughed and mocked him for his nerd talk ! it was all in good fun but none of us actually took him seriously .
i still remember that conversation like it was yesterday .
this is what the woman see before the ruffie takes over ...

i do n't exactly regret it because as op said there are so many things that have improved in my life since i broke up with my ex .
however that does n't mean that you wo n't miss them because of the good times you shared .
i 've found myself thinking about my ex even more now during the pandemic .
there are many times i wish we could talk or share stuff .
you have to stay strong and do not contact them !
you will figure out how to live without them in time .
i got it when it was onsale for 150 got their protection plan to which saves me the hassle of shipping it
i assume this will at least be a misdemeanor .
a lot of people are however and reasonably opposed to factory farming on a mass scale .
this leads to massive pollution and waste as well as animals being born for the sake of living a horrible life and then being killed .
tupac got shot on two separate occasions and did n't rat .
oh baby just a little more smile next time ?
i agree i think a big reason the scene is having a hard time really legitimizing itself is the lack of cross-band play .
like not just a vocalist coming in for a chorus or breakdown but how the used and mcr did under pressure two full bands collabing .
it 's fan service to the max and it 's something that pop/hip hop/edm pretty much every genre has made meta that modern metal just seems to have a hard time doing .
this is a big step in the right direction !

i was doubting the part about his promos being fully scripted and then remembered that bit on beyond the mat '' before he records his interview with michael hayes where rock is like what 's the word again ?
it 's funny because at one point during 1999 apparently the undertaker said something about the rock having writers and there 's an episode of raw where rock says obviously the rock writes all of his own material and he wrote a little something on you undertaker .
he then proceeds to cut the exact same promo he always cut on 'taker which was basically mickey mouse tattoos and thirty three pound head '' .
i think he was referring to that question as a whole .
i only responded to the familial side of it .
that being said that mofo was amped up like crazy .

why not just ask if he is into you as much as you are ?
it sounds like you 've fallen pretty hard just ask him .
if you do n't get a response then you have your answer .
in my experience if he takes days to respond he 's just not that into you ... .

she was meant to get a solo at season 1 sectionals but after their setlist was leaked she deferred it to rachel .
and in season 2 sectionals mr schue made a point of using different people so she was n't used .
rachel wrote an amazing original song at regionals so they let her sing it and finn wrote 'pretending ' for him and rachel to sing which is why there was a finchel duet at season 2 regionals .
and then in season 3 mercedes was colead on at least 1 song in each competition as part of the troubletones .

the way she created this album in such a short time space is incredible .
each song is spectacular and overall the album captures every vibe and mood of quarantine .
if you have a plan and the means to carry it out you should be inpatient .
ah so there is an odd audience that enjoy rappers poop lines .
there is something so ironic about people who are the least quailified to speak on a given subject are the ones speaking on the subject .
we can have a discussion about armored units naval infrastructure and air forces and you would kick my ass but something that i know is the us is pretty much immune to occupation pretty much because there 's more guns than people .
you forgot everyone asking why did biff go to the normal 2015 but doc and marty did n't ? ''
and preface it in a way that makes them sound like they think they 're original .
a union rep or spokesperson usually gets the job because they can publicly express the members ' case far better than most of the members .

i love you so much for making this thank u 🥺
i am pretty sure it scales with the amount of azerite you collected but that may not be the only factor
wondering what is so important to have a live audience though .
i use it too it helps to keep track of how many fossils i am missing and which bugs and fish i should look for before their season is over .
presumably the house in question is intended to be sold and the proceeds split between the four siblings .

indian cricket has exponentially more human financial and infrastructural resources .

it is not directly caused by the virus but most likely an after effect .
it runs great on really shitty laptops it can even run on phones .

i know earlier today when i heard that you had to beat moon lord on expert mode to unlock master mode i took my normal world character with post moon lord stuff to beat him on an expert world .
i struggled fighting with the sdmg and vortex amor i ca n't imagine how difficult he 's going to be on master when you do n't switch characters .
i think the op has a fair argument actually .
we 've consistently seen better trained pas than nps out of school .
what op is arguing is to not lump nps with pas as all midlevels being the same and i completely agree with op they are vastly different .
also unfortunately a lot of members from the np community have been stepping on other professions mainly ours and have been saying that they are comparable if not better than physicians at what we do .
it 's like if you told a pt that your training and education is just as adequate as his/hers but also care for the patient more because your training makes you better at caring for people in general .
in medicine we 've heard nps call themselves brain of a doctor heart of a nurse .

i have no idea why you 're being downvoted .
i hate the st but i genuinely think that the pt are poorly made movies with great sw mythos as proved by tcw fixing everything the prequels failed at .
the failings of the pt though are not the same as the failings of the st. prequels failed at execution and only partially sequels failed at the idea stage which is just so much worse .
boots of mobility these birkenstocks sacrifice chic for comfort .
great for lounging around the house or a trip to the beach .
but terrible for when you need to chase down a singed .
berserker 's greaves these things are metal and i do n't mean figuratively they are full plate metal .
excellent if your opponents ca n't aim but otherwise too heavy to be trudging into battle with .
boots of swiftness swiftness is actually the name of a piltovan brand a clever marketing scheme .
in actuality they 're anything but swift and the feathered accoutrements add little to these off-brand berserker 's greaves .
these things are both chic and comfortable definitely the perfect touch to any popular look .
decently fast but zero arch support so not recommended for extended activity .
mercury 's treads they 're not fast or elegant but these steel-toed combat boots are perfect for traipsing the treacherous terrain of runeterra !
waterproof quick release lace hooks i simply can not recommend these enough !
ninja tabi despite the horrendous marketing being neither stealthy nor tabi these boots are the premiere item for speed on the battlefield .
these boots are magically enhanced to make you abnormally fast !
do n't mind the price tag soon you 'll be running so fast even jhin ca n't keep up !

hello all i 'm currently working on a rivals of aether workshop tier list .
however this tier list wo n't include broken/boss versions of the game .
basically if a character is blindingly fast with no weakness then they will not be placed in columns s-f. its still a work in progress but i plan on being gun ho until i get it done .
if there is a character you want me to review please post .
i promise to be fair and judge a character by their tools and not my own skill at using them .
i go through the workshop every wednesday looking for new maps/characters/buddies .
ronalds/variants 100 accurate characters and sandbert clones will just be put in the broken tier matthis xavier and papyrus are also in this tier for being too unbalanced .
abyss hime is in the boss tier because she is an evolved form of hime daisho .
i was n't a very well known hero in fact i had only started started a few months ago .
i had only dealt with petty theft and a few actually robberies .
but when i heard about an actual super villain attack i rushed down to the center of town to fight them but.. the problem was ...
i actually have no idea how to fight a super villain .
——————————————————————— so this is gon na take some explaining because i did n't really go into detail about how this would play out so i want to be defeated in my battle against the villain and instead of being killed they take me back to their lair and pretty much do whatever they 'd want to me warping me into a free use cumslut .
bonus points if you play a monster maybe a venom type thing .
i 'd prefer this to be oc but if you 've got really good idea i 'll try canon stuff .
i play in my older brother 's island and we share it with our two older sisters and our mom .
my mom is really into the game and whenever she gets home from work she says i ca n't wait to go to the beach .
anyways she wanted to make a bathroom in her house and she bought a claw foot bathtub from the store but for some reason it 's not in her storage or anything .
so i was wondering if there was anyone who had one to spare or of their store was selling it could give me their dodo code and i could come to ur island to buy her a new one as a surprise .
the tub is worth 23,000 bells so i wo n't buy it for anything more .

yesterday i had people interested in some fossils but i got a little occupied with my buy 1 take 1 .
so here is the updated list of fossils i can give
let me know if you need any of these !
looking to complete this race ... well rather immerse it in the game properly .
right now its weird i 'm referred to as a vampire to other vampires ...
i 'd need a voice actor for serana that way when he finds her she can recognize him for what he is same with harkon .
race stats are above standard vampire stats ... not including unique vamps or vampire lords elders or other high ranking vampires etc ...
stamina pool will be increased and drains only a little when being used for sprinting and combat..
a few attributes increased speed strength jumping height etc ...
race ability i want a rage mode added that can be used once daily and automatically activates when your health drops to 30 or below ...
what it should do is increase your speed both movement and combat damage soak and damage effectiveness ...
so while active you are granted temporary immunity and you output more damage
while also attacking much faster with no stamina drain ... .
the buff lasts for 30 seconds when your health drops to 30 or less ... . also while this mode is active you cant use any weapons and instead use your claws its almost like a feral state .
theres 1 ability that can be used during this phase and can only be used during this its slashing blitz type attack .
you will naruto/ninja run with your claws out everywhere you go and deal high amounts of damage .
the naruto run has the lazy wavy arms looks trash
you move silently and all of your attacks deal critical damage .
sneak arrow attacks can 1 shot enemies depending on level of course .
you have all the physical strengths of the vampires but none of their inherit weaknesses ... .
so sunlight does no damage ... fire is not a weakness 10 resistance to frost or cold ... you dont need blood to recover or heal ...
however drinking blood gives a temporary boost/bonus to stats ... you have no inherit weaknesses to any weapons but you have no immunity to any weapons either ... you do not have any vampire related magic spells though you can learn whatever spells you may want .
physical features you will look more human than vampire but its all in the eyes ...
just need assist with the slashing dash attack some script configurations and voice acting .
it 's an inventory full of hybrids that i 'll deliver to your island
if you do finish your project though take my 800 bucks with pleasure.else i 'm just gon na stick with a pinephone they also have little switchy kill switches for the mic .
ok i guess i hope purism does n't finish their phone ?
i 'm sticking to the purism forums this place has an agenda
so i just got the game and it 's downloading now and i was wondering if anyone plays it still like what times what modes and so on or if so is it playable or does everyone hack and ruin the game like bo2 thanks

i just got done watching '*one of our planets is missing ' and besides the animation faults it 's a really good story for star trek and sci-fi .

i just recently watched a cwa video in which he discusses the state of the game with other popular cr content creators and i loved it .
it 's very nice to hear the many different opinions on the games and nice solutions that they all offer .
with how much these creators love clash royale it would be awesome to see a few developers potentially start a podcast maybe once a month and answers some questions live from the chat or even enter cr content creator 's podcast for a discussion .
if you any of you have time for even 30 minute podcast once a month we would appreciate it so much !

has anyone ever died whilst pretending to be dead ?
the most likely scenario i can think of is a bear attack where the common advice is to play dead so some people must have been killed while they 've been pretending to be dead .
another i can think of is a battle field situation where your army has just gotten wiped out and your kind of injured so you play dead and then get killed by some vengeful dickhead on the opposition .
is pretending to be dead a fight or a flight response ?

hey so i have office 2019 through my university and i 've been noticing all semester that my papers take more words than they should .
i 've tried to figure out why but my settings are all standard .
yet at 1x space a single page is 700 words and at 2x it 's 350 .
like every student i have subtle ways of extending my papers in the rare case where i can think of nothing to write .
but i 'm wondering if word is doing something weird to stretch the pages since all i can find online says that with these settings a page will always be 500 at 1x and 250 at 2x .
it 's not the end of the world but it does really suck when a professor asks for a 15-page paper and i know that for apparently no reason at all i will need to in effect write a 21-page paper .

we almost had a couple of setbacks on tonight 's walk .
there was a dog in his/her yard that almost got out because apparently the gate on their fence is weak .
and when we got into the park there was a person with an off leash dog .
it 's not a dog park just a little playground with lots of open space that i use for leash training and hopefully recall training with an extra long leash once we 're ready for that .
i 'm proud to say that with a quick correction my dingus of a dog refocused on me both times though with the dog in his yard she started to act scared after i corrected her which is way abnormal .
i 'm talking tail tucked head down trying to keep as close to me as possible .
i mean usually she 's right there ready to go back at 'em if she is n't ignoring them like she 's supposed to .
i almost did n't know what to do because i 'm so used to spazzy dog not fearful dog .
only time she 's acted like that was when she went on a date with me and it turned out the guy had been lying to me the whole time about everything .
she 's cool that way looks out for me .
but we had to stop after we were past that house and out of sight of that dog so i could reassure her that she was a good girl and it was all okay .
it was really weird and i do n't think it helped that that behaviour threw me so she knew even less of how to react .
but after i had reassured her that everything was okay we went into the park which is usually empty at our walk times saw off leash dog and his owner .
lucky for us that dog had amazing recall but he did stand at his owner 's side and bark for a minute while i ushered my girl away .
she focused on me after i corrected but she did n't act at all like she had the dog before .
other dogs in their fences ... no problems just a correction and focus exercise and we were good .
i do n't want to call it a setback because it was n't really reactive behaviour as i 've seen from her before but it was different and not necessarily what i want to see from her .
i want her to behave around other dogs not be afraid of them .
we 've only been really working on this a few weeks and she 's moving at leaps and bounds now that i 've set firm boundaries for her .
i 'm waiting for the other shoe to drop i guess .
i got an error everytime i run my code .
when i run the same code in ubuntu everything is fine .
i reinstalled windows reinstalled python trying different settings but none of them worked .
i cant wrote any code it makes me mad .
i may not be able to tell you which is which but i can for sure hear the difference between 2 identical audios with opposite polarities as long as they are asymmetrical in shape .
if you told me to do with with a sine wave i would n't be able to but everything else is audible .
i hope i do n't sound like too much of an asshole i 've been internally frustrated for the past month or so with my partner and it 's starting to make me dislike him .
the point of the matter is i do n't want to dislike him but i am noticing i 'm becoming mean towards him and i do n't know how to fix the behavior .
for starters i am a full time uni student and daycare worker .
i 'm not currently working due to the lockdown but luckily still receiving checks .
i moved in officially with my partner right as the lockdown began and have been splitting his part of rent with him .
my partner in regards to work was n't so lucky and was laid off two months ago .
since then he 's become essentially a couch potato just playing video games and spending the last of his money on weed .
i have never seen him unproductive before and it irks me .
i essentially renovated/cleaned the entire house i 'm no germaphobe but it was treated like a party house i.e the bottoms of your feet would be black moving from the bedroom to the bathroom garbage dirt bugs everywhere over the course of quarantine and changed the standard of living. it 's been respected ... until recently when he had his friend move in .
his friend is n't currently paying rent he moved his girlfriend in without a forewarning and completely wrecked my bathroom on a day we were n't home .
my partner and i agreed she had to move out or his friends rent would double and could only spent the night 4x a week .
his friend consistently brags about making money whilst not paying my boyfriend rent .
my boyfriends nintendo switch was stolen within the last couple weeks from our bedroom ... .wonder who it could be ?
my boyfriend said he would make a contract/roommate agreement as of 2 weeks ago and still has n't done it .
he is always reliant on me to feed him as he 's not working .
he got mad at me for having lunch with a girlfriend and not offering to get him anything .
he just asked me if he could borrow 14 to buy something for his bong .
i asked him why he could n't and he said he does n't have any money but is expecting a 400 check soon rent for him is 350
he claims to have applied for over 80 jobs but has n't gotten a call back and nit-picks opportunities to work .
plays video games with his friend/roommate all day everyday .
constantly talking hypotheticals well ... i when i do this i 'll do this when i get a job ...
always says he 'll do things i.e clean his broken car to sell build things he wants to build contract job university .
he considered a productive day building me a small table i ordered and then going to home depot gift card to pick up a grill .
i had to really try hard to make him do either .
he just does n't do anything but play video games watch cops and smoke weed .
it 's frustrating and i 'm beginning to resent him for all of it .
i can not support him especially if i 'm going to need to pay his rent and for his groceries .
how do i talk to him about these things ?
all i am doing is snapping at him to get stuff done and he just shuts me out i am handling this very wrong .
ive had league for some time but i have never been able to play consistently because i didnt own a computer i recently got one so im looking to start playing league a bit seriously at least more often anyone up for showing me some of the ropes and having fun ?
so some of you may know that i have posted a few alpha test chapter ones and one of the main complaint is lack of hook which i admit .
yukha had always grown up being told stories and folk tales among them were the tales of warlocks .
he had remembered them to be cruelty and callousness their worship of demons and hellspawn their suffocating presence .
funny he thought that he had heard the stories plus the rumors and even met two of three people who have come across one yet never he himself so as to personally verify .
but now that he had a honest to gods warlock in the iron tumbel beaten and bloody from a bar brawl he had started and smelling of strong brandy he was thinking of changing those conceptions.
there was a specific persona 3 i think fes walkthrough i watched part of on youtube some years ago that i 'm having trouble tracking down now .
the major aspect of it that sticks out is the player chose every single dialog option and cut together each choice to show all possible reactions and basically the entire game .
i 've tried searching for this to no avail .
so i just started playing zero and i 'm not too far in halfway through chapter 1 but i really like how this game makes your team feel like a bunch of rookies .
every fight no matter how mundane the enemy looks is hard .
hell i saw the wald fight and told myself this is gon na be easy '' ... yeah i got my ass whooped .
to be honest i like how the game makes you feel like the npcs that are fighting the bad guys that need rescuing from the realain characters like the bracers saving your asses all the time .
to be honest i expect for the team to power level and get stronger as the game goes on but i like the pacing so far on how your team is a bunch of rookies getting started
i have scars on the right side of my face and was wondering if glycolic acid is goodbye remove scars and if so which glycolic acid is the best and how should i apply
i started streaming recently and up until tonight have been doing console games .
tonight i wanted to do a steam game on pc with 2 screens .
one with the game and the other with obs managing the stream .
if i clicked onto the second screen at all eg .
adjust audio it would freeze my game and sometimes my webcam and the second screen would slightly change resolution .
then when i clicked back to the game on my main screen the resolution on the second screen would reset and the fullscreened game would continue .
i can see everything in obs on the second screen just fine while the game is running which is great to make sure everything 's running but i want to be able to quickly switch back to the second screen when i need to if for instance a tech issue arises which it did and/or a setting needs to be changed .
this seems less to be an obs/streaming issue as it is a windows 10 issue as it involves the game stopping for some reason and a complete resolution change .
i suspect it might be because the screens are different sizes main is a 1600x1024 mag monitor and the second is a1920x1080 hp monitor .
however i tried setting the resolution to be the same in a test even if it makes empty space on the second screen .
same problem so it does n't seem to be a resolution issue .
both screens are running on the same gpu nvida geforce gtx 1050 though the main is on vga while the second is hdmi .
i 'm unsure what 's going on and how i can make this seamlessly work .
even if the game has to get unfocused if i use obs on the second screen i need it to keep running especially if the issue 's audio related .
anyone have any recommendations or thoughts on what 's happening ?
well i finally had a conversation with somebody on stadia we 're both enjoying assassin 's creed funny enough he is a doctor who lives in new york and i 'm in california ...

i ordered a gaming headset from amazon i 'm hoping it 's amazing because i love grid and it sounds amazing with just regular headphones ... .
i am very curious about the origins of my last name .
i know that it is basque and i am very interested in the history of my surname and if it still a common last name in basque country spain or france .
in the united states i know that the last name is most common in new mexico where i live .
hi i have a ps vita and recently i felt the urge to play doom on it but i 'm kind of tired of the old maps .
if you do n't have the vita remember that wads that need zdoom or gzdoom do n't work
hello everyone so i 've noticed that since summer is about to start soon my room has been getting hot lately .
basically i want to know which fans are best for my case to have the best air flow for better temperatures .
i 've only had my pc for about 2 months now and i want to get at least 2-3 more fans .
i currently have negative pressure and zero positive pressure .
basically what i understand is that my 2 fans are blowing air out of my pc both are in the rear of my pc one in the back and the other at the top .
so what fans should i place in the front of my case for more positive pressure .
any recommendations for really good fans for good airflow .
i forgot to mention that i have the nzxt h5100 and am using the two pre installed fans .

when i have it plugged in to charge and i 'm using the headset it will turn off for about five sec and then turn back on by itself .
it continues to do this while plugged in and is extremely annoying .
if anyone can help it would be much appreciated thanks !
whenever it is plugged in just turn off the breathing effect and just the lights completely off .
does not appear to do anything as my lights are off but when i plug in the charge cable they turn on causing this loop of turning off because of the lights and turning the lights on because its charging .
i have charged my g933 wireless headset throughout the night to 0 affects as it was still on 5 battery or 23 minutes remaining .
i am completely unable to use my headset for long periods of time because of this .
if anyone can help it would be much-appreciated thanks !
i got pregnant at 18 with my first child .
obviously was n't planned but ultimately welcomed with joy to two loving parents .
after that i grew up a little tried for a year to have another and found out i was expecting another one .
after 2 it was years of trying before we conceived our third and last baby .
every month i started my period i would cry i would take dozens of pregnancy tests and hold them in the light for hours hoping to see that second line .
there are millions of women who would give anything to be in my position and i feel guilty because it 's so hard .
when i see the posts all over the internet or hear the women i know talk about how badly they want to be a mother it kills me inside knowing that i 'm lucky enough to have children but it 's still so hard .
it 's stressful and far from perfect but they 're mine and i should be grateful not stressed .
let 's do some roleplay in this quarantine then gaming then more roleplay !
for one if it threatens the life of the mother i dont care how late the abortion is .

most polaroid cameras do give you some control over increasing or decreasing the exposure .
the only models i can think of off the top of my head where they eliminated that were the one and one600 classic/ultra from the early 2000 's .
just decreasing the exposure probably wo n't give you the look you want it will just make everything darker .
it looks like this was shot on a foggy day that 's what 's really creating the haziness .
the light diffusing helps create a low contrast scene notice how there are no strong black or white tones everything is grays .
contrast is something you can easily control with digital and can influence with traditional film but not so much with instant .
when expired for several years high speed instant films like polaroid 's type 667 could give a similar look https en.polaroid-passion.com/galerie/meaulne/index.php ? id=86465 from=g thanks to their loss of contrast over time .
unfortunately they 're no longer made so that 's not really an option .
so i 'd say try shooting in fog and you should get something pretty close to that .

looking to get some more depth of knowledge if you 'll forgive the pun
in fact here is an exposition by ju mipham refuting the misconception that everything is one
to begin with there is an analysis of the essential identity of all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena to determine whether or not there is true singularity .
in the case of those conditioned phenomena of the five aggregates possessing physical form there is a division into above below the cardinal and intermediate directions and the centre .
through this it can be seen that for something such as a vase singularity is simply a conceptual notion applied to the various features that are the basis for such an imputation .
true singularity is not established and the same applies in the case of its component parts .
the body and the limbs are also divided into parts in the same way .
in short all that possesses physical form and is composed of material particles may be broken down to its basis which is the infinitely small particle .
and according to the logic explained before for that most subtle particle to be surrounded by particles in the various directions it must have sides which means it must have parts and so on in an infinite regression .
if not then however many subtle particles are gathered together they could never grow any larger .
thus all phenomena with material form lack true singularity .
in addition the eight or the six collections of consciousness can not be established as truly singular since they consist of various cognitive acts and mental states take various features as their focus and arise in different forms from the gathering of the four conditions and then cease .
by analyzing everything that has the nature of arising and ceasing deriving from its own causes even the subtlemost indivisible moment can not be established and so all phenomena included within mind and matter lack any true singularity .
as for non-concurrent formations they are simply imputations made upon the ‘occasion ' of mind and matter and so they lack any essential identity .
unconditioned phenomena are imputations made with regard to the eliminated aspects of objects of negation and are also lacking in any essential identity .
in short all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena can not be shown to have any true singularity and since this is not established plurality that is made up of what is singular must also remain unestablished .
and so since there is no mode of true existence aside from being truly singular or plural it must follow that individuals and phenomena are proven to be without inherent identity just as it is explained more elaborately in the ornament of the middle way .
— ju mipham 's investigation of the essential identity neither one nor many from ‪four great logical arguments of the middle way‬

my hs boyfriend said the same shit to me and it did bug me a bit because i knew we were young and probably would n't be together forever but hell i loved him and at the time he was the one so in response to cheesy soliloquies i 'd just say 'wow i love you so much ' because that was the truth at the time .
there 's no need to be super worried about this .
you 're not tying the knot you 're just young and in love .
let yourself enjoy your love right now even if it might not last forever .
i cringed too but not from the age gap i mean victoria melbourne were beautiful .
i think it is the match itself that looks cringey .
the girl in her ig photos she comes across more like a sex kitten scantily clad great body and oh yeah ... . messed up beds .
she is probably a wonderful woman just that i thought he had outgrown this type .
in my mind he is melbourne who just does not match with this sex object .
guess just wanted him happy with the mother of his children .
if not then i thought he would pick a pretty innocent prim proper heiress .

the white kids at your school should have been addressed about their behavior .
that it was so prevalent in your school is truly sad and frustrating .
you have my sympathy for what must have been a difficult adolescence in that environment .
i hope you are doing well and that those kids have learned .
it is racism and needs to be confronted ... perhaps by a professional especially when paired with such vitriol for the mother/self-loathing for her own biracial identity .

have the ai remember based on each persona for joker and each party member for not joker .
it wo n't be able to scout your team as effectively .
that 's where you 'd probably have to make them able to lock your ability to swap out party members/personas or be able to shift their weaknesses themselves .
you could also make it so that if you have to flee from a fight or if a shadow flees from a fight/is spared it shares information with the shadows in the area .
oh hello friend it is unexpected to see you here
my first impression is that games like kojima 's open world games tomb raider naughty dog 's games crysis etc .
that focus on hyper realism real world environment scans or rely on graphics for their real world storytelling '' ?
this is a pipeline to make high resolution and/or realism a reality since they definitely have the people and pipeline to drive that .
but games like animal crossing candy crush saga inside o-kami hd fortnite and many others having a certain minimalistic and intentionally non-realistic art style probably wo n't even use this particular tech and pipelines for their workflow ?
also on mobile games i think this wo n't change a lot since the memory footprints are really tiny here .
canola oil ... like i think it was mixed with grapeseed or some cheaper oil .
in other words moldbug can explain accurately and palatably how the postmodernists aka the left '' are lying about basically everything with fantastically selected and well-cited primary sources .
could you tell what are the books where he adresses this specifically .
as for being horny i 've learned just not looking at anything sexually and stopping masturbation .
i know it may feel good but it leads down a rabbit hole i was lucky to avoid .

i think it 's a lot harder for people who look at you every day to notice changes since they 're so gradual .
while i do agree you totally look female on the right denial is a hell of a drug in cis folks !

hey girls now is the time of year to raise awareness for breast cancer by posting some inane as shit word as your status .
everyone will totally care and men wo n't have a clue .
if even a handful of them get enough teaching that they change their views it might be worth it .
we do n't need anyone else shooting up a college campus because no one would fuck them .
this just feels like a reboot of the feminazi memes of 2016 .
bullying outspoken women does n't seem like the politically responsible thing to do .
there 's definitely some funny cringe out there of people flipping out on retail workers but this meme seems to say men yelling righteous anger women yelling overreaction .
do n't dwell on it i think it 's quite natural .
i also assume nobody here understands my native language so i talk freely about anything i want with my friends .
of course there 's a good chance that some of the people that overhear us actually took a german course in high school or learned it somewhere else and understand us but you do n't think about it in that moment .
everybody looks different than what you 're used to so it 's an automatic unconscious assumption that nobody will understand you .

if it 's a middle/quicker paced i am unaware of any games leaning towards competitive pvpve outside of the cycle that are similar .
if it 's slower and levels matter a ton yeah theirs a few that existed at one point like paragon/battleborn .
what are the other similar games depending on if it ends up mid/fast and slower with aiming being a focus ?
i did n't have a welder at the time and now that i do the crack is covered completely in jb weld so that would be impossible .
and i heard weld reacts differently to heat than an aluminum block so during heat and cooling it might 've caused the block to break more that 's why i steered away from welding it .
but okay man thanks i 'll just be easy on her and try not to put too much stress on the mounts
hmmmmmmmmmm maybe you 're right and i missed my chance but she seemed awkward when i said it .
i guess what i was trying to say is that if you wear it longer but have roughly the same activity i 'd expect the day where you wore it longer to have more calories .
totally not because the germans wanted to distance their brand of socialism '' from actual socialism iirc .
if the most important thing in your life is your wow account then maybe getting banned is not such a bad thing .
that 's a fair point however the gun lobby and pro-gun people want no restrictions at all
you can find many gun owners in here who say they are very supportive of restrictions .
that you characterize all gun owners this way basically says you 're prejudiced to an extreme degree and are giving yourself permission to basically disregard them .
you can browse this thread to find multiple canadian firearms owners who support restrictions but are critical of how the government did this one .
it does n't really make sense to bring people who are knowledgeable about guns into the discussion

hi everyone i 'm starting p90x tomorrow and i 'm excited to test my discipline and see how well i stick to it .
i 'm having trouble understanding the diet portion of the guide .
i know how many calories i should eat in total but i ca n't figure out how to correctly divide my macros for optimal toning and fat loss .
i think my ideal weight is in the mid 160s and i 'd like to slowly lose fat as i do p90x and gain some sort of muscle .
does anyone know what my macro breakdown should be in order to accomplish these goals ?
or at least know of a guide i can follow ?
hi just got kinda sharp pains in lower back/hip from landing .
i think i must have landed quite stiff on my left side i feel like its just my left side that hurts .

log in to the support section of their website .
from there tell them what your issue is what game and that you 've already contacted the developers .
i 'm totally cool with them suspending people for a day to fix things and go through accounts .

i live in an area where horses unfortunately are popular and it baffles me .
they have such big heads and such small mouths .
it 's like shoving a battering ram in a coin slot .
they are dangerous and they walk on their fingernails .
no one can draw them successfully because they look too weird .
they are n't as fast or colorful as cars and they have no cup holders or windshield wipers or anything .
their legs are too skinny for their sausage bodies .
we have no reason for them cars are just fine .
i hear on the news about people being killed by them all of the time mr hands anyone ? .

i watch a lot of music video 's and fmvs .
i always watch them on my tv using first my sony blu-ray player then my amazon firestick and now my samsung smart tv .
yesterday i went to watch a video that i 've watched many times and it said that the video was age-restricted and asked if wished to proceed .
it had never done this before as i am over eighteen and restricted mode has always been turned off .
after clicking wish to proceed '' it then says sorry something went wrong '' .
at first i thought it was maybe a glitch but after googling it i saw that a few people were having this issue one post about it dating back two weeks .
i sorta found a way around it by logging into my connected account .
but i never use that account to watch video 's on only to post so none of my playlists subscriptions etc .
i could just remake the playlists and re-subscribe but i 'm worried the same thing will just end up happening there .
does anyone know why this happened on my main account that i just found out is a brand '' account and how i can fix it ?
video 's work fine on my phone and my computer .
when i go to the settings on my tv it says restricted mode is off .
personally i am disappointed that half of the bosses are disappointing at first look .
i 'm learning little bit of javascript and some html canvas stuff .

as the title suggests i want to know if it is possible to rebind a key or mouse button within a lua script .
for example maybe i want my right click to be rebound to k '' during a loop but then restored to a right click otherwise .
merely making the click or button result in k '' is n't good enough because i want to prevent the original click or press from being executed .
edit i would also benefit from know how to prevent ismousebuttonpressed 1 '' from reading pressandreleasemousebutton 1 .
i just want it to read the physical state of the button .
many people can join in on the content making so we can have each story arch for each character visable from different perspectives .

so i 've just started a character where i can co-op for the first time .
me and my co-op mate got through all the chalices necessary for the platinum so by proxy i have every chalice available that going through that path will give you .
i 've got like 3 available for loran 3 for isz about 6 for pthumeru all that good stuff .
we killed the queen went to ng but now i 'm in dire need of some blood stone chunks .
every single chalice i try to search is telling me i do n't have the required materials no matter what .
i just tried to search a glyph for what 's described as an frc isz '' so i checked the isz chalice that you can chuck offerings onto and made sure to stock up on everything is asks for and nothing .
you do n't have the required materials '' i give up ps4 controller gets launched through a closed window .
is an frc isz its own chalice that i 'm missing or is it an isz with offerings ?
do i have to make a frc isz chalice first then search for the glyph ?

it 's currently our 3rd month of dating and this one has been the worse month yet .
i 'm in a long distance relationship with a girl that gets upset and moody incredible easily .
a few days a go she got upset with me out of the blue .
she went to bed really earlier and did n't talk to me until the next day .
i still have no idea why she was upset with me .
the only guess i have was that i was playing a game without her .
i have tried talking to her about it but she keeps saying 'she is n't ready to talk about it ' or 'will tell me later ' .
the other times she gets upset is over very minor things i do while we game together .
sometimes i accidentally kill the person she wants to kill or i accidentally misfire at her in the game .
if something like that happens she is likely to get moody very quickly or come off the game and cause an argument .
i try to redeem myself by giving her good weapons and loot in the game but it never works .
a part from her getting upset easily the rest of the relationship has been great but i 'm started to get tired of how she 's acting .
i really want to work on these problems with her but she does n't open up easily so it can be challenging .
does anybody have any advice or been in a relationship like this ?

30m 195cm 13 stone asian rash on neck has been present for five years no other known medical issues no medications no drinking smoking or drug use .

it 's definitely not an std though since i 've had the rash since before i got married .
the dod instituted a travel ban across all military branches on the day my boyfriend was supposed to come see me .
the day i found that out my little brother and pretty much the closest family member i have was in a bad accident that cost him one of his legs .
after two months my brother has received his prosthetic leg and is in a great headspace .
this allowed me travel to my boyfriend for the first time in 3 months .
i 'm just happy being with my boyfriend and doing all of the stupid shit that everyone else would judge me for .
i 've never done this before but thought i 'd offer just because and see if anyone was interested !

i 've been hearing a fair amount of talk about musl libraries lately and have been thinking about trying it out .
i 'm not exactly sure what the hype is about and what musl does that glibc does n't .
i 've heard that it runs faster but then i 've also heard that it 's slower but more secure .
given the amount of work required to make the switch i 'd like to hear some more details before embarking .
to anyone who uses or has used musl how stable is it compared to glibc ?
what are the benefits or drawbacks that you have noticed ?
for the record i 'm only a hobbyist and am thinking of going musl as a learning experience just for fun .
i do not run a server and i do not use a computer for my job so i have the freedom to sacrifice stability for educational purposes .

these companies tend to favor white people on their promotion/review videos .
also just watched a promo video of a chinese company i worked with and it seems like they chose mostly white people too .
based on the stats i see most of their customers are from america and europe .
does a white person feel more comfortable when they see a white person doing business with asian company ?
yah know what i mean if a black person saying something to a white person vs. black person has a different weight .
main question are these asian companies just worshipping whites or do they just understand the fact that having people similar to their main target audience aka white people review their stuff holds more weight thus increasing business ?
i 'm on book 1 chapter 6 and literally every episode so far has had the subtitles stuck on .

hi i 'm coming here with some concerns relating to my system .
long story short around this time last year my last pc broke dead and i had to hurry purchase a new one as i had no other choice .
i was actually saving for a better build but what the money i had atm could buy was basic
ram 1x 8gb kingston hyperx fury black now upgraded to 2x
storage 1x kingston a400 wd 7200 rpm caviar blue from my old pc
as you see not the best but it surprisingly is able to run most of what i throw at it i 'm not obsessed with graphics much i usually play not that demanding stuff and if i do i do n't worry much about the graphics level .
certainly an upgrade from a i3-3220 gt630 6 gb ram .
now the plan was still to keep upgrading this not to a super beast but something modest that 's better basically the cpu and gpu .
i 've decided to do gpu first as i do n't want to wait and have the resale value of the gtx 1050 drop much and because i 'm noting some games i play like yakuza kiwami 2 or aoe 2 de run okay but borderline .
after consulting with more knowledgeable people and browsing the upgrade that fits what i want seems to be either a rx590 or a gtx 1660 super .
i have gotten warnings about being careful with that so thinking about it i saw the rx590 seems to consume more so the gtx seems to be better though honestly i do n't know .
this comes because i 've seen mixed messages about it and because using all these wattage calculators give me different results .
so basically the question is ¿would this build be able to handle the gtx 1660 ? and ¿could it handle the rx590 too ?
mind that i would only play 1080 gaming i have no higher pretensions .
and one for the future ¿should i upgrade the cpu ?
i 've had sleep paralysis for about 3 or 4 years now .
it happened often in high school because my sleep was so irregular .
one night i was laying on my side and i woke up in a daze trying to drag my consciousness awake .
my room was the first one down the hall so really close to the front door .
the front door had big heavy knockers on the outside and i heard them start banging super loud .
my heart started racing and each bang was like a pounding in my chest .
i ca n't remember if i heard it open or if i heard any walking but before i knew it i heard pounding on my bedroom door .
the fear and dread got worse as i heard my door slowly creak open .
i did not want to see what was coming in .
i closed my eyes and remembered the steps i take when i realize i 'm in sleep paralysis .
i woke up again a few minutes later because cold air was blowing on my body .
i felt someone rapidly fanning me with their hands up and down my body .
the same kind of hand-motion as someone drumming their hands on a table but it was blowing air on my body .
it was really weird and for some reason i did n't remember anything that happened previously and my mind went to the idea that it was probably my brother just being weird and pranking me .
i tried as hard as i possibly could to turn over to tell him to go away but all i could do was open my eyes .
i was facing the big windows on the other side of my room and in the reflection i saw the huge black figure of a man as tall as the ceiling .
i closed my eyes again because i did not want to see anything else .
i was absolutely terrified and could feel his presence next to me .
the noises grew louder and louder and i could feel him getting closer so i peeked one eye open and saw a huge black hand coming at me .
it was closing in on me so i squeezed my eyes closed and did not open them again .
i tried to calm down and just go back to sleep .
that was probably my worst experience the second one being the demon sitting at the edge of my bed i could n't see it just hear and feel it .
it 's funny i love being scared telling scary stories watching scary movies etc. so it 's really fun to have these stories to tell but in the moment it is absolutely terrifying and horrible .
so have i just watched lost too many times now being 13 years from the initial airing or am i surprised at how shocked all of us were at the flashforward twist ?
i 'm on my fifth series rewatch right now and it feels like it 's painfully obvious that the flashback is n't that at all .
for starters i ca n't think of any episode prior that opened in a flashback .
all the other little hints throughout the episode about jack being a hero .
him being depressed i guess you could pin on taking place after his divorce but it does n't seem like the writers would 've skipped over that til the season 3 finale .
plus the most intense fans know that jack attacking his dad at the aa meeting got him back drinking which got him to lose his license leading him to australia etc etc .
not enough time in between all that for a bearded/depressed/addicted phase .
when watching it i wonder how we were all so fooled .
when i see youtube reactors get to this episode i always expect/worry they 'll figure it out early but they never do thankfully .
i ca n't tell if it 's the regular pg-13 cut or the director 's cut of lazer team on vudu .
the picture and runtime suggest that it 's the director 's cut however the description and rating suggest that it 's the pg-13 cut .
ive had an xbox for 3 years now and recently my controllers have been doing stuff like move my camera and moving my characters in game as if i was walking left .
this is a recent issue i have come into because it has not been happening before .
the first case of it happening to me was when i had bought a volcano shadow controller .
2 weeks after i got that controller i switched back to my original controller because the shadow controller started drifting .
now a few months latter my original controller is doubling imputes and having issues with the drifting .
if anyone has any solutions i would be greatful to see/try them .

a month after getting the hpv vaccine i got optic neuritis blind in one eye it is awful .
the neurologist says i have ms but i do n't think so .
he refuses to say that it was the vaccine that may have caused this but to me that seems obvious .
there is a known link between vaccines and optic neuriis it is also very closely associated with ms. while my neurologist refuses to consider the vaccine and not ms as the cause of my on my internist believes it was the vaccine and wrote a doctors letter stating that .
both my neurologist and my internist are highly respected top doctors in their respective fields .
has anyone else gotten diagnosed with on or ms or both shortly after getting a vaccine ?

i feel like my life has so many narcs .
my mom is a narc my grandma on mom 's side is a narc all great-aunts on mom 's side are narcs several of my uncles on my dad 's side are narcs my grandpa on my dad 's side was a narc great grandma on mom 's side was a narc etc .
and not only that but people outside of family are narcs too .
i 've had at least two golf coaches who are narcs .
both of them physically assaulted me when i was a teenager .
several former highschool friends are narcs and at least two of my ex-girlfriends are narcs .
is it just that i attract narcs my family is just shitty or are people shitty in general ?
and if the answer is the former why is that ?
does being raised by a narc lend us to be more vulnerable to meeting more narcs in the future ?

i would like to integrate the new sonos arc with my android tv from 2015 sony bravia kdl-55w805c .
the tv supports dolby digital/dolby digital plus/dolby pulse and has a hdmi arc port .
since dolby digital plus is a codec that can transmit dolby atmos https developer.dolby.com/technology/dolby-audio/dolby-digital-plus there might be a chance to work together .
normally netflix is streamed via the android app so therefore the atmos signal should come from the tv .
but i have also a playstation 4 pro connected via hdmi with the tv .
in that case the tv would just need to passthough the signal to the arc port to sonos arc .
do you have any experiences in the integration of older android tv models with a dolby atmos setup ?

however every time i try finding out what is going on with the irs get my payment '' site for the coronavirus relief checks the site keeps coming back with information does not match our records . ''
i have tried numerous times for at least 3 weeks now .
after two attempts putting my information in it keeps locking me out of the site for 24 hours .
i know my information is correct and i qualify for the relief check ! !
what is going on what can i do about this and is there any person/number/whatever that i can talk to to get this straightened out ?
wow amazing edit for two amazing people we lost way to soon 🙌 ❤️
pretty sure it 's more combat-oriented than either despite its exploration '' label .
but honestly it 's all speculation anyway since finished ships rarely live up to what they were marketed as .
but i still say worst new intern is schmitt because seems out of his depth so often and surgery may not be what he 's cut out for .
hmm i think his hand might have been forced because of that but it has worked so well that there rly is no reason to change it .
in those games we 're not expected to have most of the ball anyway so the extra attacker will just end up pinned back most of the time .
if that 's the case you might as well swap him out for a defender .
plus the midfield structure is retained in the 3412 so if our midfield does improve and we 're crazy good and building up that just means added opportunities for the counterattack and less chances for the opponents to attack us .
this sounds silly but try to think of it a different way instead of the way you do .
instead of seeing progress only after reaching one months worth of emergency funds change it to how many weeks or even days you have saved up for instead and you will have a much brighter outlook on it and more motivation .
say 2,000 of emergency funds cover one month for you divide that number by 30 .
that 's basically 67 per day that you need .
when you put your 500 in there monthly think of how you now have added 7 days to your emergency fund instead of how far away from one month you are .
saving is not easy for everyone but if you change your outlook to enjoy all the small victories instead of the mindset of struggling to reach the main goal for months or years on end you are only sacrificing your own happiness in life when all it takes for a happier you is changing the way you think about your savings .
the time it takes you to get there likely is n't going to change but there is no need to feel down when you are actually following through each day week month and year like you have set your self up to do .

anyone who believes otherwise should find the nearest crowbar and promptly remove their head from trump 's ass .
right because it 's somehow trump 's fault that china and the who lied for months about the origin extent severity and ease of transmission of this virus .
maybe you should use that crowbar to remove your head from your own ass .

when men start having their dicks cut off with dull shards of metal while being held on the ground in public with everyone watching as they scream in agony and beg for death then you can compare the 2 .

if you look at time and expenses it probably comes out to less than a dollar per hour .

yeah that 's my point ... if they wanted to do it it would be really easy to implement actually why waste time doing it in a roundabout way ?
we 're talking cooperation between an insane amount of people .
different countries are researching it too and there is no way everyone is secretly in on it .
this line of thinking is so incredibly illogical i actually ca n't accurately track how you even get to that point .
because the majority of national leaders have their own people working on it as well .
this affects everyone 's economy do you really think no one has been looking into anything since november ?
i do n't know if you 're just trying to play devils advocate and try to see it from their point of view but that point of view is terribly wrong at a foundational basis so there really is no point in even wasting time with such a stupid theory ...

i think everyone is not understanding just how cheap space x has made space travel in just 10 years .
in 2010 every single rocket launch would cost 500 million usually .
a huge cost of the iss 200 billion was purely launch costs .
it 's 2020 and the average launch costs are 100 or less now .
if starship achieves its goal the average launch cost could be 10 million definitely below 50 million .
by 2030 i expect space x will have landed a starship on the moon and planned on if not completed a starship attempt land on mars .
by 2040 launch costs will likely have become so cheap that we are already have space hotels and new iss .
by 2050 there will be over 10,000 active people on moon/mars hopefully more .

i 've been reading some old zines and reminded me that i still have n't found this comic .
as i remember it the style was fairly rough .
full black-and-white no grayscale or halftone dots like a newspaper comic .
so i think there 's a good chance that the comic originally ran in a zine .
unfortunately that does n't really narrow-down the time period or make it much easier to find .
unless anyone knows of some big comic zine directory ?

hey man we are a small and new game studio .
i am gathering a team to build a vertical slice of 3d triple a quality game that has a similar concept of counter strike and valorant .
once we are done with that we will represent the idea too big studios throughout my connection and if they liked the idea most likely will we will get full funding for the project and we can start developing on a higher scale .
as of now we are 2 developer 1 3d environment artists and others will join soon .
we are looking for more developers and artists but for now most importantly 2d concept artist to flesh out maps we can get the ball going .
if you would be interested just let me know .
noe this is the type of content i 'm looking for .
not really i guess i was being histrionic with that statement .
i simply mean that tech billionaires are political allies to the ccp in building institutions that oppress both the populations of china and the united states .

but that 3 pronged one may be the one that i would actually do if that scenario becomes my reality .

i was at the park in my neighborhood and i was going to hang myself .
thankfully a couple of my friends heard about it and came there to talk me down .
once they finally did some of the bullies that had been tormenting me to that point were trying to egg me on and telling me to do it .
i snatched on of them and wrapped the rope around his neck until his face started to turn colors and then pushed him to the ground .
i was at the point where it was going to be either me or them .
i never did anything to rectify it and i still feel good about what i did to them .
they deserved worse given how they treated so many .
that same night i told my parents about everything and committed myself to a mental hospital and stayed for a few weeks .

i laugh at all of the losers that thought it would be a great idea to bully others because i see how shit their lives became .
aww man do you still talk to any of those people if so do they remember that ?

in addition to family and social norms one aspect that does not get enough blame are policies of government education regulators ugc aicte etc .
their policies have resulted in setting narrow windows of time with hard deadlines between 5-6 years during which one has to succeed '' .
if a person does not succeed '' according to their criteria they are simply discarded out of the system as if they 're a faulty component in a production assembly line .
never mind that people 's interests may change with time .
nope you have to choose one road and that is the only road open to you from then on .
no wonder we get so many posts from people in their early 20s calling themselves burdens '' on their family and contemplating suicide .
this seems to be the norm in asian societies .
i 'm always impressed when i read experiences from n.america and europe where people in their 30s or 40s or 50s and sometimes even older talk about changing their field entirely by attending college that late in life and even get jobs in their new fields .
and sometimes they 're really major transitions like civil engineer changing into a medical doctor .
their education policies support them to find their true potential .
it just makes more sense to me to let a person become a happy contributor to society all their life rather than a depressed young dead body .
but i 've never come across such experiences from older people in india ever .
this is a great example of victim blaming here once again i say go tell the woman assaulted in aberdeen or the family who faced vile threats that the reason for what they face is justified .

well canada is a stable civilized western society with healthcare modern advances and a good economy with clean water food and medicine .
somalia is a 3rd world hellhole with no food no clean water and a collapsing government that ca n't take care or protect its people from pirates and thugs who raid peoples farms for the scraps of food that they can barley scrape together in a barren hellscape .
for what it 's worth i say canada and most of western society has it pretty good compared to most places .
he 's basically trying to say that it does n't touch any of the regular monoamines sert da ne significantly at all that the serotonin action that is marketed or claimed to exist is bullshit without any evidence the adrenergic antagonism that is claimed is very weak that it 's an anti-histamine drug at it 's core and not a true anti depressant it 's a sedative medication .
he thinks that the main component of biological depression is lack of vitality energy interest motivation apathy and this drug does the opposite it may reduce suffering but not treat the core symptoms ''
there 's some stuff that was alright but it 's a bit bland .
if you want some good superheroes outside of the big two with some good substance check your jeff lemire 's black hammer books .
you do realize he said the people protesting are poor because they 're stupid not every poor person is poor because they 're stupid right ?

i 'm so used to just pressing play and not having to manage what podcast comes next .
i just tell it which ones i like more than others and it does everything on its own .
if i were to switch to any other podcast app this is a required feature .
i 've tried a few but none of them have this .

yeah that website emad was on was n't correct actually .
but not all there are some extremely fit cops too .
honestly the fat stereotype is true but also depending on where you live there are some really fit people .
no if they can not be counted on to protect us then they should not be paid at all .
what we need to do is legislate the idea that police officers are indeed required to protect the populace first and foremost and then redefine the use of force because they are absolutely becoming to violent without sufficient cause .
no we are expected to talk about our research it is part of the job .
but we are also trained to talk responsibly and not make outlandish claims .
i 'm not sure what you want based on that .

capitalism always trends toward the direction it is in now .
it always becomes more predatory less forgiving and damaging .
the only check against this is organized worker power .
the forms of capitalism most people will say they like the kind in history where people were more prosperous ... yeah it was n't the capitalism bringing that .
that kind of critique might sound good to people who do n't know what they 're talking about .
but i 'm a communist and really just have to shake my head at the examples of parents owning a house and sister running an e-commerce store '' .
neither of those are private property nor means of production .
the house only becomes private property when it is being rented out to tenants .
a house for your own personal use and not used to make money from other people in a marxist sense is not private property .
if its something like etsy and the sister is literally making her own things and selling them ... no communist that knows what they 're talking about would have an issue with that .
if it 's something like redbubble the means of production would be whatever factory is actually making the stuff .
so you 're right that people are n't protesting those things ... but there is a marxist reason for that too not whatever capitalist one you had thought .

i 've learned rather painfully that things which are complex need a bit more description to make them feel significant '' .
i 've found that not describing it ends up both missing the nuance and making it hard to understand that this is an important thing '' .
i recently re-read edited a part of a significant power i wrote and realized there was way too much leeway to interpret what is going on .
this worked fine for setting the scene on the first draft but it fails to convey any and all of the complexity of what 's actually going on .
now i 've rewritten that for the full descriptive experience '' i actually find i 've gone too far the other way and probably need to cut it down by a bit .
but the thing i 'm finding is there has to be a middle ground and frankly it 's easier to edit out than edit in .
in 99 of all other cases i 'd advocate to write less .
except here 's the thing if it 's something that has specific mechanics that are unique to this setting if you do not explain them they will be assumed .
in a case where i 'd advocate write more i think as much as possible '' is where to start .
once it 's on the page you can then figure out what 's redundant .
but until you 've written it you just assume oh okay so i described that and people will get it in future '' .
so something happens in future that does n't match the rules and it feels like wishy-washy things happening at random .
because this is an out of the ordinary '' power event readers have no frame of reference .
i can say she opened the door '' or he hit the power button .
the computer started up '' and be 99 certain people will know what i meant .
so if you just stretch the arm '' and provide no context the assumption might be anything .
it has no rules no deeper meaning it 's just arms in this setting can stretch huh odd '' .
if all the reader needs to know is arms can stretch in any form '' then those details does n't matter .
but if there 's even a hint of a larger dynamic at play you 'll need to actually go into the stretching .
how is this in some way significant compared to he reached out and touched the door '' .
since i have n't edited down the new version it 's fairly really obvious what the two extremes are here .
i know the middle point is somewhere in between .
maybe just comparing how those bits could be on both extremes will reveal the proper amount for you too ?
i only really realized i had an issue when i compared both of my versions side by side and went huh okay so a does n't work and b is just as weird ... .

in my family 's minecraft server there was this small valley between the hills everyone 's houses were on .
my brother being an idiot fills the entire god dang floor of the valley with berry bushes .
it 's a fairly large area and so it was a lot of berries making our pretty server so randomly ugly haha
so one day i decide to make a big build down there but first i have to get rid of the bushes .
by the end i think i had 10 or so stacks of just sweet berries and i 'm beyond annoyed .
now what do i do with all these useless berries ?
in his entire chest room with just one berry .
i also filled all his item frames furnaces shulkers anything .
oh and i did it on the whole floor too .
needless to say a week later i got a similar treatment in return when my brother filled all of my chests with rotten flesh from our zombie farm .

i purchased the abh luminous foundation in the wrong shade so i returned it .
i will be getting store credit in my account within the next week to get a replacement foundation .
now after doing some digging research and using the findation website i 'm realizing i 'd rather purchase the smashbox studio skin 15 hour hydrating foundation instead of the abh foundation .
i definitely need more of a satin demi matte foundation instead of a luminous one .
since the smashbox foundation retails for 36 and the abh is 38 will sephora allow me to purchase the smashbox one instead ?
or does it have to be an abh foundation ?

is it just me or are a lot of the tw wh maps kinda ass ?
choosing the best terrain to fight one of the traditional advantages of being a defender the attacker may choose when and where to fight a battle on a strategic level and therefore pick the fights most advantageous to him but this is somewhat balanced out by the defender being able to prepare a fighting position that best suits him .
usually this means setting up on top of a hill to allow your archers and artillery to fire on the enemy army as it approaches .
not all maps have prominent elevation of course but it was generally pretty easy to find at least a small amount of exploitable terrain in previous tw titles .
with total warhammer however i frequently find myself deployed on the slope toward the bottom of a large hill or just behind a large ridge or saddled with similarly garbage terrain that i ca n't make much tactical use of .
often times i 'll need to either race to the top to try to seize the highround before the enemy can which usually results in not having any time to fire before melee is joined or to abandon the high ground entirely .
now obviously sometimes having blocking terrain is an advantage if you have a very small ranged component while your opponent has a lots of ranged but mostly its a massive hindrance which largely serves to strip away the defender 's traditional advantage .
i have a vague feeling that these maps were designed with multiplayer fairness '' in mind where both sides have the same funds and giving one side a terrain advantage would be unfair '' as they seem to inconvenience both sides to a degree even if they tend to hurt the defender more .
while there are more traditional '' maps i feel like i get the obstructed ones far more often then i ever did playing medieval rome or shogun .
well at least i do n't get those awful germania '' style forest maps where you ca n't see shit very often anymore .
so i put in an application and realized i made i mistake so i submitted another application .
they are throwing out the second application and basing everything off of the first application .
when you 're driving a sibling somewhere and you pick out specific songs on your playlist you think they 'll like and they put on their headphones .

my name is phi and i am one of the co-founders of hippidy http rewards.shophippidy.com a new type of shopping rewards site along with my 3 partners .
we are excited to announce that we are very close to launching our beta !
the idea is that we often miss out on buying products at the best prices however whenever we do see a price drop most retailers do n't allow for price adjustments any more .
for the rare occasion that they do it 's only within a 14 day window .
that 's why we want to reward people by giving them points for price drops .
we 'll monitor the price of purchases across all other retailers for the next 30 days to see if it drops in price at all .
if it does we 'll notify and reward you for the difference in price with reward points .
you do n't have to be constrained by retailer price adjustment policies anymore to get money back !
at launch we will provide our users with three core features designed to be completely seamless to use
earn points just through shopping with retailers gain points by shopping through hippidy at favorite stores .
with over 100 retailers we want to make sure you are able to build up points fast and easy .
redeem cash gift cards with your racked up points .
earn points with price drops guarantees we 'll monitor the price of your purchases across all our retailers for the next 30 days to see if it drops in price at all .
if it does we 'll notify you and reward you for the difference in price with reward points .
you do n't have to be constrained by retailer price adjustment policies anymore to get money back !
purchase tracking use hippidy as a personal finance tool .
we will track the real time value of your overall monthly transactions .
giving you transparency and insights into your purchases and how much you can be saving each month so you can take action we 'll notify you if a price drops enabling you to take action and get price adjustments with retailers .
we 'll not only monitor your purchase at the retailer you bought it at but also track it against other retailers .
or sit back and relax because the more it drops in value the more you 'll earn .
we 're working on launching these features soon but want to get initial feedback from customers to see if this is something you would be interested in or sign up for .
if you want to be part of our beta group please just enter your email to sign up and get notified when we launch !

i do n't really know for sure but i 'd say some pastel green or something is really nice to look at i do n't know if it 's objectively the best tho .
also the human eye can differentiate between more hues of green than any other color so maybe that means it most enjoyable ?
so i have a survey in forms which i want to convert to sharepoint list using flow .
is there any way to convert any type of forms field into a people column in sp list ?
rating and likeart forms fields should be what type of columns in sp list ?
this is just me trying to gather information about this sub .
thank you and a new chapter is coming soon .
those who have received an interview offer from suss after appealing could you give me some pointers as to how to craft my appeal to suss ?
i love star wars battlefront ii after the team turned it around and i wanted to move on to another dice title to check out their other work .
i 've only jumped into a few multiplayer games of bf1 though they seem to take a lot longer to join and the games i 've fallen into have all been these massive-scale several phase affairs .
i can appreciate the epic scope but i do n't often have 40 minutes to sit down and play a single match .
it 's a bummer putting in 20-30m and having to leave and gaining no progress on my career correct me if i 'm wrong about this .
can anyone point me in the direction of quick and reliable game modes wherein i can cut my teeth and learn the game while gaining some levels and unlocking content ?
i have the revolution edition if that makes a difference .
what is the difference between shallow and deep copy ?
i know the theoritical part of it but im not actually able to understand while practicing it .
1 does the list.copy work on shallow copy technique ?
2 how does it differ from the other copying techniques like the operator slicing list constructor ?
i have experimented it on the interactive python using two lists list1 and list2 .
when using list2 list1 '' i was able to see changes i made to the list2 on the list1 .
whereas copying the contents of list1 to the list2 using list2 list1.copy '' did n't do so .
aces wear a black ring on their right middle finger to symbolize asexuality .

in another forum i found that the solution is to move that file to the folder applications .
so i 've been meaning to share this here for a few weeks especially after listening to dan 's interview on the addendum feed awhile back when he mentioned the creative decision to give the different series a kind of 'title ' and it got me thinking about supernova in the east and how genius i think it is for a few reasons .
i actually produce my own pretty much dan-spired podcast about cambodian history the khmer rouge called in the shadows of utopia if you are interested and i remember when i was planning the show in the year up to actually getting that first episode together in late 2017 i had this idea relating to supernovae and how that astronomical process leads to other stars forming out of the vast nebulae of gasses ... like these kinds of shock waves that can just kick off those initial processes of gas gathering into something that will eventually become a star itself .
now what i was thinking back then was trying to use that as a kind of metaphor for how sometimes far away events geographically in history can cause shock waves that eventually lead to other historical processes and events ... in this instance i was thinking i think about the formation of the soviet union and how that eventually led to something like the khmer rouge coming to power more than 50 years later .
i ended up dropping that metaphor and using the one i am more happy with an idea i call 'the historical hurricane ' where you get 'cold dry weather systems ' mixing with 'hot moist ones ' or something like that and i relate that to the 'local ' historical context in cambodia and how 'cold dry foreign winds ' interacted with that to eventually create a kind of devastating 'historical hurricane'..
anyway the reason i thought dan 's title for the latest series was so cool is because currently i 'm researching the period of cambodian history that entwines with imperial japanese history during wwii .
japanese troops are stationed all around indochina after the french defeat to nazi germany and while they do n't actively take control of the region vichy france remains tentatively in control of that part of the empire they do have a huge influence on the course of events that take place and they are certainly instrumental in fostering the small nationalist movement that was growing in cambodia .
they eventually foster a coup in march 1945 that leads to cambodia briefly declaring independence from france after more than 70 years of colonisation .
why i think calling the introduction of imperial japan onto the world stage is akin to a 'supernova ' in a planetary nebula kind of goes along with that idea i tried to express before ... this massive japanese 'explosion ' onto the scene has a huge effect in many of the nations they ... well 'show up to ' .
starting or influencing the process of all these other mostly colonised asian peoples and their fledgling independence movements .
asia for the asians '' was a novel idea to spread particularly when japan had colonised parts of china since the 1930s ...
naturally the other allusion that comes to mind and i presume is the big one is with the end of the war ... some of you may have been to hiroshima and visited the museum there .
there is a fascinating exhibit which is kind of like a big map in the middle of a room with a little red ball smaller than a soccer ball suspended from the roof a kind of representation of what the blast would have looked like at some incredibly early point as well tying into the idea that it was almost as if a star and all of the attendant devastation it would bring had appeared just above the city .
i do n't know if either idea had occurred to dan and therefore led him to title this series 'supernova in the east ' but i thought i 'd share what i make of the title and how cool i think it is .
could 'supernova in the east ' be a reference to the effect imperial japan had on colonized asian peoples and or a reference to the almost literal 'sun ' that will be dropped on the country in 1945
i 've been in a lot of fandom roleplays i like them .
i have played both canon characters but also ocs .
so there was this roleplayer let 's call her m who was in a couple rps for the same fandom with me .
she made a server with the fandom 's world but we basically roleplayed as our original characters there .
now my character was m 's love interest she wanted it to be that way herself .
now i still like to build the relationship and my character was dealing with some shit so i did n't want them to get together instantly i felt like that would have been boring .
m never said she had a problem with that .
one night we were roleplaying in the group and then i had to go to bed i was in a different time zone so they kept on .
when i checked the rp in the morning m 's character was together with another character and she was basically pretending like her character never had a crush on my character .
now that would be fine i would n't have a problem with her changing her mind .
but what kinda upset me was that she did n't ask me about it did n't even tell me about it but just basically ignored my character 's involvement .
and she had moved onto someone else 's character because she was too impatient to wait for 3 hours for me to get back and did n't communicate with me at all .
this is n't the worst thing but it made me feel left out made me feel like i was no longer worth her time because i did n't want our characters to get together the same day the rp started and because i had to be gone for a few hours .
i just feel like it was a little rude of her and after that i felt very left out in the rp .
you see i 'm scared of confrontation even when online with some random people .
so i only brought it up as a joke and she got super defensive .
in those three hours i was gone they were suddenly adding some supernatural elements to the characters something we had never plotted or discussed of before .
i get it of course they can make progress when i 'm gone that 's just fair .
but what made me realize that she and honestly a lot of roleplayers in that group were pretty toxic was that they often left me out and it was n't just because of the timezone thing .
they would say things like oh let 's wait for another roleplayer c before we go on with the plot so they do n't miss it '' but when i was gone for 3 hours they turned the whole thing around .
look i would get it if she was 12 or something .
and again before someone gets me wrong it was n't because she wanted to change love interests no i just felt left out especially when she was one of those people who did n't give a shit about anyone else 's characters except hers and her character 's love interest .
she also always had to make everything about her character .
her character always got into trouble always cried and if other characters had problems she always made them about her character .
her characters were always the same too no matter if it was her oc or a canon character .
i roleplayed in a same group with her in four groups two of which were her playing a canon character and two were her ocs .
i ca n't believe i put up with that .
maybe because i liked the other roleplayers and had become friends with them all .
edit love that i made a typo on the topic .
i think everyone knows it 's supposed to say bad '' .
i translated the v jump and here 's some info i got
a new map is coming translate said it 's called zaku zaku island
his skill one is most likely a counter which if got increases strength
skill 2 is a mid range attack where he swings his stick

i am looking for a small lightweight mobile setup for when i am on tour to work with cubase-10 and camtasia-9 .
if i could use one device for both it would be fantastic !
my boy benedict is also crafting a wood bed .
some things are in front of nooks you can pick up .
still terraforming my island so it 's not that great for now .
you do n't need to tip or anything but yellow hyacinths would be nice and watering my flowers would be appreciated .
just wondering how to say i have the same thing as you '' ?
the main thing i 'm getting at is the word as '' in this context .
so i 've realized that trying to go mainstream in my mmo search has mostly failed me .
i 've had fun searching up pokemon mmo 's and playing those but i 'm a bit nostalgic for the old school stuff from 2000-2004 .
so i 'm mostly looking for single server or small games with like 1k-2k active players where the devs actually care about the game .
examples would be project 1999 pokemon planet/pokemmo maybe project gorgon .
i do n't really care about bugs or clunky gameplay .
edit might just play osrs unless anyone has some solid alternatives .
i am a bot and this action was performed automatically .
please contact the moderators of this subreddit message/compose ? to=/r/gamingcirclejerk if you have any questions or concerns .
even weirder and definitely explains why they looked so dry .
the word moderation does n't exist in his vocabulary .
a lifetime of being betrayed abandoned or hurt by those you expected to love you make you end up driving others away before they can do the same .
i know i 'm not the only one in this scenario but if one of my aquaintances says something that suggests how they may react if i revealed the truth to them i slowly leave them .
for example i had to live with my parents for a long time but i sometimes heard a friend '' say that adults who live with their parents at my age are losers .
yeah im not gon na staying in that false relationship .
sadly it doens n't make me less paranoid or more trusting .
actually if this can be done remotely i want it .
i mean the period blood would be your blood as well ... i 'm sure cold water would also work fine
economically unsustainable practices such as maintaining a national debt greater than the gdp
from what i found in 2016 debt held by the public was approximately 13.84 trillion or about 76 of gdp .
at the end of the 4th quarter of 2019 united states public debt-to-gdp ratio was at 106.7 .

i do n't know how to initiate a conversition due to lack of social skills and have absolutely no clue how to learn to do it .
basically i consider myself to be a very uniteresting person who does n't have much to offer in a conversition .
even though i have various interests and hobbies but i ca n't add them into a conversition because people are always bored when i talk about that stuff .
also a lot of interactions i had with other people were rather unpleasant so i 'm pretty much afraid of talking to other people in most cases .
the loneliness makes me feel like there 's void in my chest but i am able to live with it for now
i learned it growing up and my parents always told me never talk to police .

if there is nothing for the big spenders to buy they do n't buy it .
if they leave less content is made and the mid range spenders people who buy things that are more fairly priced will leave the game as it is no longer producing the same amount/quality of content .
then the game is left with just f2p players and is no longer financially viable and is shut down .
every game with in app purchases has some crazy priced items that the majority of people would never dream of purchasing .
that 's why they 're are priced that way .
brawl stars is n't even that bad for it .
some of the mounts on wow went for silly money just as one example .
pins will undoubtedly become cheaper but the point is that some people have bought them at this price and it 's a part of what keeps the game a viable business worth investing in and updating .

there is one other option for libertarians that can get around the current spoiler/game theory trap caused by the fptp voting system .
i think if we can get more unified there 's potential for us to play a king maker role in politics .
so first we have a poll to find out how many people we can get to pledge their vote to our cause .
some estimates gallup poll https en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/libertarianism_in_the_united_states put it at roughly 20 of the population but we probably only need less than 10 .
the tighter the race the less we will need .
then we negotiate with the major parties for the incorporation of libertarian policies .
the party that most closely aligns with libertarian values will get all pledged libertarian votes as a block .
the outcome would be publically debated and deliberated on and decided by a randomly selected but statistically significant portion of pledged voters via sortition https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sortition with input from a panel consisting of libertarian think tanks cato mises etc and the libertarian party .
the good thing about this strategy is we do n't need critical mass right away .
we can build up momentum over time and when the time is right and our win-ability is there for everyone to see then we can go for the jugular to displace one of the major parties .
after each tackle there is an opportunity to steal the ball .
look at the video at around 0:28 you can see three welsh players forming a kind of wall over the tackled player .
if the french team wanted to steal the ball they 'd have to come in from their side of the line and push those guys backwards past the ball .
you can see that they do n't even attempt this .
it 's really hard to do and requires a lot of manpower .
if they failed to gain possession of the ball their defence line would be a few men short for a few seconds and being so close to the goal line would mean basically a guaranteed try .

if a police officer comes to the aid of another police officer and flashes his badge you best believe he was n't questioned .
like i said if you just knew the name of an officer from the town you would be let off of a dui arrest .
all you had to know was someone 's name .
now think about an actual officer flashing his badge in the 70 's at a crime scene and offering assistance .
another redditor put it best if the badge was n't helping him commit the rapes why did he stop as soon as he lost his badge ?
why did he drop a fake badge in the back yard of a victim if he was n't worried about suspicion on those who carry badges ?

you 'll get used to it after a while though .
i mean they seem to be removing a many of the most obvious malicious actors but i dunno why that one is still up .
as in they need some real public pressure to convince them .
for what it 's worth virtually all speech laws that are upheld require intent behind the words to cause fear induce panic etc .
if there is not intent there is not a crime .
someone being afraid of what you say does not meet the bar for terroristic threats you have to have the intent to cause them fear .
the same can be applied to carrying a gun openly the mere display of a firearm does n't meet the bar unless its intent is to intimidate .
some will argue that that is what the intent is but it is relatively clear to anyone with a prosecutorial mindset that it 's not .
i honestly have no idea why people do stuff like this .
it makes no sense it does n't help the situation and it 's not going to get them what they want but they do it anyway .
people really are just rude this dude may not have yelled at him or anything but it was still a stupid response to something so small .
he could have just pumped his gas and if he actually did need more he could just go back up and pay for more .
i hope nothing like that happened to you because that just stupid and rude .

there 's a very particular set of tests it has to pass things like making absolutely sure that no candidate 's box has a marking in it for example and if it comes close to failing one then it 's classed as voter intent unclear '' rather than deliberately spoiled .
but if they do i do n't think there really is much need to isolate anyone who tests negative .
you 're testing regularly anyway and keeping up a regular thorough cleaning schedule of all commonly touched surfaces to limit transmission .

honestly i think having a physics degree from a liberal arts school is probably as close as it comes to an i can do anything '' degree as you can get .
i was so close to 500 but 100 people u subbed .
please watch my video below for at least 4 another vid of your choice minutes before subbing else your sub will go away in a while .

looking at a list of synonyms for scold i find attack damn savage harangue tear apart tell off castigate .
i never attack damn savage harangue tear apart tell off or castigate .
most certainly i tell students things they do n't want to hear about their work or their behavior .
but i do it in a mature respectful way .
what happened was horrible but you 're a young person you have a long long life ahead of you it would 've been useless to pursue them anymore or you would 've both died and it 's miraculous you were cognitive and ok enough to think about the plate number and call the police at that point it 's amazing you could do anything liek that and you are a hero even if it did n't work you tried really hard and did the best anyone could 've done ok so it 's not your fault and i 'm very very proud of you for what you did because i sure as hell couldnt have if you want to talk sometime pm me ok ?

i play div 2 and gta v 100 with a controller .
sometimes in siege if i am really tired i 'll use a controller .
there is obviously parts where i can tell i died because i was using a controller in siege but not many .

that is dependable on the case but it is true that with inhibs down theyll have the lanes always pushing into them giving them a constant flow of gold but hey i guess that basics of the game are too hard to learn

north korea speaks and samantha power says 'let them speak ' then after she proceeds to tell the un to cut off their mic .
of course it is cut off because america control the un .
another example is the un publicly denouncing america but america vitoed the condemnation because they controlled it .
and do you also remember on wikileaks with the video of the american soldiers just shooting when they assumed it was an ak-47 when in fact it was a gun

i 've been a bad person to my parents .
i 've almost certainly ruined my health by making some medical decisions over a year ago .
and i 'm going to have to ruin it again .
i 'm a burden to everyone that knows me .
i 'm not going to kill myself yet but i know i 'm going to die by my own hand eventually .
i was between a rock and a hard place .
it was either suicide within the immediate year or so or just prolonging the inevitable .
now i 'm starting to wish i took a risk with the suicide .
i feel guilty for the way i 've treated my parents .
for the first time in my 16 years alive .
i 'm objectively a bad person no matter how you look at it .
i want to make my final years with them pleasant but i do n't even know where to begin .
i 'm going to have medical issues in the future and the last thing i 've ever wanted was to be a burden on anyone .
i want to live with my parents and make up for my behaviour but i also do n't want them to see me like this .
i want to have been born as someone else .
i want to take a chance with reincarnation no matter how unbelievable it sounds .
but i 'm also wracked with shame and guilt .
i 'm a poor excuse of a human being .
there is nothing i can do to begin to clean the putrid stain i 've left on this earth .
not until i 've made it up to my parents .
but i also want to ruin what remaining relationship we have left so they do n't feel any sort of unpleasant emotion when i die .
all of this is a direct result of my actions .
i 've returned to old habits i have n't used in three years .
this is the first time i 'm admitting this .
i plan on suicide by carbon monoxide within 15 years .
i 've been farming golem for a wile and i ca n't seem to get any of his cells what 's is going wrong i 'm in the temple but i only get the fragments
i have had a pair of soundcore liberty neo for about 6 months now and they have been working fine but yesterday the left earphone became extremely quiet .
it 's not a pairing problem as even the startup tone and battery level are extremely quiet .
is there any way to fix this i have tried cleaning them but it did n't work at all .
ok so i 'm hunting a star wars actual play podcast .
i do not know when it was made could be anywhere from where episode 3 was made i guess .
the gm was a guy he had a stutter .
one of the characters was played by a female and she played a female pop singer .
her companion/bodyguard was played by a dude he was a somewhat elderly clone ex-trooper with a very reserved vaguely dour demeanor .
the story involved the pair traveling on a starship that was hijacked or ambushed they managed to survive the encounter .
she 's wondering if maybe she was targeted but ultimately there 's no enough information to be sure .
they have a few interesting encounters she rendezvous with her dad who turns out to be a high-ranking imperial officer .
he purchases her a kind of reactive armour garment to give her better protection .
later they have an awkward dinner at a governor 's estate turns out said governor has lots of non-human slaves he 's a slimy creep and and likes to torture said slaves .
she is asked by one of the slaves if she 'll talk to a slave boy who 's seen her on space tv he asks if she 'll sing a song for him .
she goes to her concert there 's loads of extra security .
she decide she will sing the song she 's been asked even though it 's pretty weird .
afterwards she gets called by the governor who 's furious his entire staff of slaves has abruptly vanished without a trace and thinks she might be involved .
she and her bodyguard have a conversation she wonders if the song was a message or code and whether she 's inadvertently become the pawn of the slaves or maybe even got them into serious trouble .
her bodyguard says if you truly value snakeboy 's life you 'll be ssssilent about the whole matter .
the pair of them were fairly sure there was some larger scheme at play but could n't see any way of avoiding it except going about their usual routine but bumping security up a couple notches .
shortly afterwards possibly at another gig she 's randomly ambushed by an assassin droid .
related they did another aborted rpg also star wars i think there were 3 players all jedi just after the jedi purge and the gm played a jedi master .
they traveled to a backwater planet to an abandoned castle because of a vision their jedi master had had .
she later revealed that she would die but that they would be able to escape and trusted in the force to protect them .
vader turned up and killed her the rest put up a valiant fight except for one who fled as soon as he scented danger saying he had no obligation to the others he was in-character convincingly though .
that 's as far as i listened i 'm really hoping i can find this story as the gm was great at making and describing a lived-in world and the two players were very convincing intelligent and articulate and i was on the edge of my seat to have this mystery unraveled .
sorry i did n't screenshot it but there was this person in avakin life and he had loads of wings and saw that i had them too .
then he said hi and did a dance with me .
he said he would gift me wings but i said he did n't have to as i already have some .
i did n't know what he was gon na do nxt when i saw him go to another girl and then another etc .

i 've been doing a lot of research and hunting down manufacturers/distributors of the parts used in euro rails because i 'm building some things where it would be easier to have a small pile of bulk lengths and cut them down as needed vs ordering a bunch at a massive markup
i 've had no problems identifying the main rail portions in agreeable sizes 60 '' perfect for cutting custom sizes but i can only find threaded inserts from the few manufacturers in max 84hp no larger .
i know they have to make them larger as i have a set of rails here at home that are around 120hp and they are seamless it 's not two pieces .
and i doubt many of these small eurorack shops are custom making or getting them custom made .
does anyone know of a distributor/manufacturer making m3 threaded strips in sizes greater than 84hp ?
if not do you personally find it frustrating when a rack is using joined threaded inserts or is it not really noticeable .
hi guys just wanted to see if i could get an answer on when i can start paying off the loan .
i have a phantom gaming 570x wifi ax motherboard not sure if other specs are needed .
under my audio selection taskbar speaker icon it has reverted back to my monitor speakers .
i will see it disconnect and reconnect rapidly when i open up systems bluetooth .
updating drivers appears to be the only thing anybody has to tell me which of course i did first thing .
a few weeks ago i had the chance to try several perfumes from for strange women and i really enjoyed and was intrigued by the different scents and how they developed on my skin .
for reference i tried fsw 's perfume oils rain decadence debauchery and the solid perfumes nightshade garden siren antique settee and violin in the attic .
i enjoyed all of them to some degree i especially love rain and bought a 5ml bottle but it fades super quickly on me .
decadence and debauchery smells amazing on me and lasts on my skin and i am 100 buying a full bottle next time i treat myself .
wanting to further explore indie perfumes i ordered a bunch of samples from alkemia i have like 15 samples to try haha .
i have n't gone through all the bottles but several of the vials i 've sniffed have this cloying almost eye-watering solvent-y hairspray-ish overtone .
kind of like when you walk into an elevator and smell overwhelming old lady perfume ?
i took breaks between sniffing vials so i do n't think i overwhelmed my nose and the smell is present in some but not all the vials i tried .
i do n't notice any pattern in scent families where that smell shows up either ?
in gothique and prairie 66 i clearly smell other notes but the bad overtone persists .
i did n't notice any of this with the fsw perfumes i tried .
so far i 've only tried the lover tells of the rose on myself and that overtone was present for maybe 30 ?
i still do n't love the perfume i do n't think heavy florals are my jam i think it smells overly fake and cloying on me even after settling down but i made my dad smell my wrist and he really liked it so it may just be me !
is the packaging perfumed with a scent i just do n't vibe with and the actual perfumes will be fine ?
do i need to let the vials sit for a few days or something ?
have i simply managed to pick several perfumes i do n't enjoy ?
i 'm super curious about what 's going on here both as a buyer a person who studies chemistry and as someone who just likes to sniff nice sniffs .
even if i hate every sample i got i figure i 'll have fun taking the time to pick a new scent each day and have capital o opinions about them so i 'm not worried or anything but i 'd really love any advice/insight/anecdotes/science articles about what is going on here !
and if you have any recommendations or opinions or whatever i 'm happy to hear those too .
long story short i did 250mg of k over maybe 90 minutes or so and was pretty ketted out .
i was doing a lot of nitrous which is typical for me to go through a box of 50 nitrous carts during a k session .
i was having a pretty interesting time but i felt like something was missing .
i did n't smoke all day because i know k plus weed is iffy for me .
but i was feeling good so i smoked a small bowl of weed as i finished up the ketamine still pretty dissociated .
my pattern recognition was going nuts and i was getting lots of visuals with the nitrous on top .
so i was like oh my god i should always combine weed with ketamine what was i thinking in the past ?
so i smoked a couple more bowls and next thing i know i 'm in a full blown panic attack .
this same exact thing has happened to me about 4 times now .
i do a bunch of k have a good time smoke weed on the tail end and spazz out bad .
heart pounding time slowing down feels like an emergency .
and what was really fucked up is i started to get this crazy tingly sensation in my arms in particular .
and i was on the coming down from the ketamine at that point but was getting this growing tension and prickly energy feelings in my arms furthering my panic attack feelings .
i realized this really did n't feel normal or good so i drank a smoothie and a bunch of water and took 2mg of xanax .
this whole tense experience lasted maybe 45 minutes which is confusing to me because i should have been sobering up from the k faster but i still felt out of whack with this anxiety and weed high and body sensations .
i 'm wondering if the nitrous was messing with me to cause these bodily sensations ?
i do nitrous pretty often and binge on it with ketamine .
i 'm afraid i 've hit some kind of nerve damage point from nitrous stripping b-12 from my system .
maybe my panic and raised blood pressure causes the tingling sensations but it did n't feel right .
like i was going numb not just having sensitive skin .
edit i got a b12 shot and will probably get a couple more .
hello all i 'm teaching this semester and i was wondering what you use for your inclass discussions .
this is simply creating a discussion server i 've been trying out discord slack and microsoft teams .
slack has the ability for the users to create their own channels i assume this will help the class with their project discussions but slack seem to provide more for the paid users such as the group video chats .
so what do you use/prefer for the virtual in-class disucssions ?
i ordered the 2 items and later went to the store to pick up the items .
after ordering i submitted my receipt but i got an error message that it was a duplicate receipt and it would n't accept it .
i started a support ticket explaining that this was my first order for 5-17-20 and not a duplicate blah blah bah .
i submitted both screen shots of my receipts but had n't heard back .
i know i 'll get the 3000 but am just hoping they credit by late tonight so i can get the 143 sb for completing 2nd goal .
i also did the 1000 sb for the people magazine and that offer credited just as it should with no issues .
over the last 10 years i 've been working six days a week from before sun up until way after sundown .
with this whole crisis i 've actually had the free time to get back into gaming and picked up a ps4 .
wanted to see what people 's recommendations are for open map free roam type games for ps4 .
the last game i really got into was fallout 3 and loved it .
obviously i can just google best open map games but wanted to get a sense of what is actually enjoyable to play from the people gaming .
apologies if this is an overly simple and dumb question .
sometimes we end up with days or weeks where we have extra nrg and do n't know what to do with it .
i got everything i needed from the mk event and fused my clouds for the stmr so i thought i 'd use my extra nrg for farming gil and rank xp .
i was using scorn of the armor of oppression but i was tired of having to turtle for a turn and select different skills .
i started looking for a quicker and more effective farm so here we are !
this clear can be done in one turn for each battle there are two battles and can be done by simply reloading skills and clicking in the correct order with a nice chain at the end .
you will need very specific units so i 'm sorry in advance for that limit but my hope is that other people will respond with other ftko methods using alternate units .
each clear gives 104,000 gil and 10,700 rank xp per 10 nrg .
esther enhanced shock embrace for aoe lightning imperil alternatives barbariccia eleven lezard valeth operative zyrus radiant lightning lb sakura of the delta star wizardess shantotto
sylvie enhanced 300 def/spr buff 70 def/spr break bolt egg lightning imbue .
the limitations are that you absolutely need mastermind xon to spread killer buffs regis has 75 killer which i do n't think would cut it for turn 1 .
you also need two xuans geared towards this fight .
my second obviously does n't have as much killer as the first but it 's still enough in this configuration .
if you 're wanting to do this on repeat as i recommend so doing it potentially 20 times in a row it will be difficult depending on friend xuans so owning two of your own is preferable .
i believe you 'll also need either cp noctis or regina to pull it off i do n't have regina .
sylvie can be subbed for rikku if you use cp noctis ' 200 buff and steal that .
it does slightly less damage than using sylvie 's weaker break but stronger buff .
here are my xuans if you want an idea of how they should be geared
you want to be able to hit 300 million damage to take out the mad doll herself .
credit to u/dangderr for the original ftko strategy that saved me some testing time !
edit u/dishonorable points out you can use any 120 imbue/imperil unit if using sylvie as elements do n't matter in this trial .
with mm xon the imbue does n't even have to be aoe just saves you some time .
edit 2 regina 's upcoming enhancements will raise both demon and fairy killer to 200 making the gear restrictions even easier in this fight if you have her .
wanted to get some opinions while shopping for my next bike .
currently on a 250 suzuki that has gotten a bit small for me .
i came across a 2017 z650 with 24k on it .
listed at 5200 cad at a dealership near montreal 2 hours away from me i am wondering if this is a good deal or if there is anything i should be concerned about with this model and km .
i 'm not so sure if there is different iteo exams for each program but i hope to shift to mfi .
idk but im actually nervous now when im thinking abt it idk if ill pass and be able to shift or stay in ced lol
after almost 2 month of lockdown a beard and 7 kg i would like to improve myself .
so i bought cotw maybe a week ago and i reckon i 've bagged maybe 10 animals in that time .
i get snatched time with this game maybe 2 hours here and there and i feel like i spend most of my time wandering around like an idiot .
do n't get me wrong i know this is n't cod or some fast paced fps and that 's why i bought it i want that slow methodical patient build up that is rewarded by some beautiful scenery immersive weather and of course me taking home some trophies .
but i feel like my knowledge and skills are so low and will take such a long time to build up that it 's not easy to stop getting a little downhearted .
but i 'm determined to really immerse myself in this and enjoy it for what it is .
that 's the beauty of the game that encouraged me to drop £60 on the special edition bundle on steam .
i 've build a new computer with the following specs
2x this set corsair vengeance lpx 2x 8gb ddr4-3200 dimm 288
if i try to start the computer with all four ram-slots populated i 'll get the errorcode b1 or maybe 61 i might not read it correctly .
before it shows this errorcode it reboots a few times in a relatively short periode of time .
if i use just 2 sticks of ram it wo n't make any trouble to start the system .
also i can use any two sticks in any slots and it does work i saw the correct positioning in the user manuel of the mainboard tried this a few times .
in the uefi i disabled xmp but it does n't make any difference .
it 's my first build using four sticks of ram .
so my question is do i have to do something special in order to make it working ?
i 'm hoping there are some pro-tips from the community around this issue .
edit i 've ordered some new sticks but this time they worked as intented .
it looks like the other sticks had hardware issues .
i 've done some searching for this without luck ... ..
edit i think the system may have been a thorn emi wren luggable ... .
back in my first job well second i used to work at a computer repair place .
they used to fix ibm xt ps2 etc wang amiga .
dec ibm mainframe and all kinds of other stuff including their own nec point of sale terminals that used 8 '' drives .
which is where i started ... .shugart 8 '' then tandon 2a and all kinds of full and half height 5 1/4 drives then 3.5 '' then i moved onto drives that used voice coils and other stuff but just when it was getting interesting they closed the site .
anyway i used to use a disk exerciser tool but i ca n't remember what it was called and it 's annoying me so i thought i 'd ask here ...
it was a screen keyboard housed in one box that was beige or light brown .
it was a bit like a rounded commodore pet but smaller and more curved .
the screen may have been offset to one side and it had a built in disc drive plus a disc interface the screen was maybe 8 '' and monochrome possibly yellow and black .
this is sketchy but you loaded a disc into it and then you could select which type drive you had attached via the interface .
you could then run a series of tests on it from the screen menu like testing track 0 and doing index and alignment checks .
for the latter the screen displayed a sort of oscilloscope output with the cats eyes '' you get when you have a disk alignment disk in a drive e.g dysan or dymek .
in my searches i 've seen a few drive exercisers bit they mostly have switches and are used with a 'scope but this was an all in one solution .
we had 5 or 6 of these prices of kit and if love to know what it was called again .
the characters had the most genuine bonds with each other elisabeth roger basically the whole kucha tribe after the merge and the survivor.com episode really showed that they had emotion and heart after seeing their family members .
i felt that tina was a deserving winner and colby was a good runner up .
overall i love this season even though i just watched it .
i am a new survivor fan and i 'm sure this season will still be one of my favorites even after watching other seasons .
i 've never gotten along with my sibling and i 'm sick of people saying you 'll get along eventually or you have to like each other .
tbh i sometimes wish we had a better relationship but its at the point i do n't even want to try .
i may be being too idealistic but generally speaking i feel that the us europe and other liberal democracies should do more to bolster taiwan and isolate the prc .
would a coordinated effort to shun prc economically and politically work ?
hi i 'm someone who really want to learn seo but a complete dummy about it .
do i need to enroll in special online classes for me to understand and be able to apply it or good researching is enough for me to know things ?
i hate saying this but this game no longer feels like rainbow six .
every update for rainbow six siege is getting more and more crazy and the next game in the series has parasitic zombies from space as the villain .
this franchise use to be a tactical realistic shooter were real strategies were involved .
you did n't just run in you had to pace yourself .
siege started off strong it had gadgets that were at least grounded in reality and something that i can see a ctu doing .
now it has operators that should n't have passed the fitness exams albinos not fit for the field ops with no combat training and a fucking kool-aid man .
since this is a multiplayer game i did n't expect to be as realistic '' as the older games but it 's going to far .
the biggest issue i have is n't that the game is tactical realistic it 's what they are doing to tom clancy .
everyone seems to forget that his franchise was created as someone who had a certain vision for this franchise he co-created the first two maybe three rainbow six games .
the unrealistic features is n't just ruining the rainbow six series but a mans legacy .
people wo n't look at rainbow six and think this is a good simulation of what ctu 's have to deal with '' instead they 'll think some franchise that had zombies and a man that runs through the fucking wall ! '' .
tom clancy is n't some title that ubisoft puts in front of rainbow six ghost recon or splinter cell .
ubisoft if you are going to continue with this trend at least remove his name .
this is pretty much the end of my rant but let men clear some things up .
some people take the word realistic '' to if i do n't feel excruciating pain every time i am shot this game is n't realistic '' .
what i 'm trying to say is that i 'm not advocating for 100 realism just something that is at least grounded in reality .
for example if your calorie goal is 3000 and you eat 2700 one day if you eat 3300 the next is that deficit made up or what happens ?
want to minimize the number of times your squad gets ganked before you 're all armed ?
easy and it mostly comes down to picking where and when you drop .
tl dr in bold but it boils down to jumping later and landing further from the flight path
first lets cover a rough guide on guessing where will be too hot .
the short version is the closer you drop to the dropship 's flight path the more likely you are to have company .
ever heard of a bell curve or normal distribution ?
while the actual distribution of popularity of landing spots in any given match is going to to be quite different this ' usually going to be a pretty good rough guide .
well roughly speaking a bell curve is what random looks like .
if you graph how often you get different results when rolling two or more dice then over many iterations it 'll look closer and closer to this graph .
for us instead of dice we 're actually thinking about how far on average from the dropship people land .
if you want to see this in action just look out the back of the dropship right at the start of the match .
so if you want to be reasonably well armed before getting in a fight drop further from the dropship .
this brings me neatly to part two when should you drop ?
continuing the start-of-the-game example most squads will drop early .
most of the rest will drop in the middle .
by the time you hit the last third of the map there 's usually only three or four squads left in the dropship .
this ' a good example of exponential decay and a graph of it looks a lot like half a bell curve .
so if you want to be reasonably well armed before getting in a fight drop later .
i have 1.43 million kills on my worst character i 'll just kick ass and chew gum with the first gun i pick up and win anyway . ''
but the better you are the more likely it is you will have squad members that are n't as good as you .
they 're more likely to panic they 're slow to loot they miss shots and lose easy engagements .
give that same n00b a blue shield and a chance to pick a gun they 're more competent with and you 're dramatically increasing their effectiveness and so your chances at winning .
if instead you shout and swear down the mic about how useless they are you 're missing the point .
if you do n't adjust your tactics to your squad 's experience losing is every bit as much your fault as theirs .
all this goes both ways if you 've got 3x utter ballers who 've played the game since before it was coded and have 6.9x10 infity+1 wins each then you 're probably better off dropping early and closer to the flight path .
that way all the less experienced players are basically looting areas for you then bringing you the best of it .
nb on special locations hot zone supply shit train etc .
just assume this will always have 1-4 other squads .
less so if it 's reeeeeeaaaaal far from the flight path but it 's always a bigger risk .
nb on statistics words like often '' probably '' and mostly '' are used a lot here because it 's based on statistical arguments .
sometimes you 'll drop straight under the flight path and be the only squad there sometimes you 'll dive into a murder hornet 's nest at the far end of the map .
i 've been considering buying a house in seattle area .
i 've been living in lake city neighborhood for about 3 years and i like this area .
if i go a mile up north the city of seattle ends on ne 145th street .
for obvious reasons prices are lower in shoreline than they are in seattle but the area on both sides of 145th street has similar look and feel .
so my question is what difference does it make practically if someone is living just outside city of seattle ?
i think the property taxes might be different but there must be other things too .
i am currently learning how to dnd completely from scratch so its all very new and confusing .
i am a little stuck on one damage rolls and types rules .

hey i 'm kinda new to the game and i 'm playing with my boyfriend we got married in the game and had a question
can we invite krobus to our house even if we are married ?
i had an artificial surface jungle biome just above the biome tile limit in one of my old builds .
however the game no longer recognise it as jungle !
i was really confused when i moved towards a massive house close to it the background changed to jungle !
yet when i move back to the artificial biome the background reverted to forest .
i was baffled as i did not have any more jungle blocks in the big house .
then in dawned on me that the forest biome was overriding the jungle biome because to the left of the artificial biome is just plain forest .
when i moved away from the artificial biome towards the houses there were more normal jungle block than grass block .
however when i moved back the grass blocks were able to override the jungle biome .
if you play mad you 'll make worse reads and just create a losing streak .

how do i check/change bank info in depop payments ?
it said 13 should be in my bank as of yesterday but it 's not .
i 'm afraid i put in the wrong bank info bc my account was recently changed before i signed up to enabled depop payments bc of fraud on my account .
i 've emailed them already but have deposits to be posted today and i 'm afraid i wo n't get my !
being frugal does n't mean spending dollars to save a penny .
nor does it mean recklessly putting your life in danger for modest financial rewards .
my car is 10 years old yet well maintained my old laptop was used for 7 good years before being replaced with one that suits my needs for the next 5 years my clothes do n't have ratty holes in them i eat well and i get regular checkups .
and i still go out every so often er did before the lockdowns .
i just applied a budget and stuck to it .
i 'm not sure why you have trouble with this .
if anything having an emergency fund on hand has only further increased my safety as it keeps me from falling into deep debt where interest rates work against my favor .
just start with a small goal if you really think a bit of frugality is going to kill you and then slowly adjust your lifestyle to increase the savings rate .
or i could be wrong and always miscalculating the likelihood of an emergency even though i 'm not doing much of anything that would put me in extreme danger every single day .
... jesus i 've never pulled a dave ramsey impression for anyone but there you fucking go .
hey i 'll sign up with your referral but follow me on twitter please https twitter.com/fizimoney https twitter.com/fizimoney
they said the wipe is probably going to come at summer 2020 so that 's soon
without more information being sure is difficult but i believe that it likely is a sinful desire .
we have work to do here ... glorifying god the great commission loving others .
i do n't know if we can ever accurately assess that we have accomplished enough in our lives .
for to me to live is christ and to die is gain .
if i am to live in the flesh that means fruitful labor for me .
yet which i shall choose i can not tell .
my desire is to depart and be with christ for that is far better .
he knows that departing and being with christ will be better in many ways than anything in this world .
though as he says to live is christ. he recognized that he does have a meaningful mission and reason to suffer
but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account .
convinced of this i know that i will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in christ jesus because of my coming to you again .
his mission to be an apostle more generally it is to be a leader and teacher and encourager and helper and lover for the philippian church and others .
he then tells the philippians that their mission is similar that they have a meaning in their life and suffering
only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come and see you or am absent i may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel and not frightened in anything by your opponents .
this is a clear sign to them of their destruction but of your salvation and that from god .
for it has been granted to you that for the sake of christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake engaged in the same conflict that you saw i had and now hear that i still have .
we all have the responsibility and privilege of living and even suffering in this life that we can make disciples and work to minister building up and encouraging and loving and helping the church with our gifts .
thanks for doing this i would love to come over !
i found binging with babish 's https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=bagy2mnz-tu recipe to be really strait forward .
made it perfectly on the first try and takes up about 1/2-3/4 of your day .

on quick note i put my butter in for about 10 minutes longer since i partially worked it with my hands to soften it up/fold .

when you say seasoning do you mean flavored popcorn or like little canisters of seasonings from the grocery store they can shake out ?
there 's a local popcorn chain near me and one in chicago that are amazing all sorts of delicious flavored popcorns .
so i 'd maybe step it up a bit .
i 'm confused by the mac ‘n cheese station .
it sounds very basic and not worthy of its own station .
there 's a restaurant in nyc called s'mac that serves nothing but different mac n cheese alpine with brie and figs cajun with delicious spices etc i highly recommend checking out their online menu .
or just putting the mac on the table of comfort food .
i 'd also consider putting the fruit out prior to dessert for people who 'd like a lighter meal .
use something else until you get it fixed for sure .
this happened to me starting around a recent ios update and i think i fixed it by turning icloud for reminders off and on .
i also deleted all my reminders and re-added them .
be sure to take screenshots of your reminders before you delete them .
the problem is that the thieves are just raiding the destroyed remains of the monastery to get money in a war ridden country .
you can talk about how ashe ran into that one thief who was stealing for his family and that was before the war but that 's all hypothetical .
they did n't interact or do anything to dimitri before the battle .
even when they wanted to run he hunted them down and killed them .
if you ask 10 fishermen about why ling cod can turn blue you 'll get 11 different answers .

right sector leaders have recently assured the israeli ambassador that they reject anti-semitism along with other forms of chauvinism and xenophobia .

first of all i just want to thank you for giving me really detailed explanations and advice .
that 's one of my favorite things about this sub is that everyone is happy to help me learn .
i read what you said and i 've been comparing the headphones all weekend .
sure the soundstage is n't a drastic difference like i initially thought it would be but after doing what you said and practicing i believe i can tell the difference between the two and now i know why they 're often recommended because of it .
especially practicing with the two songs you recommended it made it easier to recognize .
now all i need to decide is if i need a bit of isolation as it seems like i might need more than i initially planned although i 'm seeing if the sacrifice of soundstage is worth it haha .
overall thanks again i 'm sure others especially beginners like me will greatly appreciate your advice and explanations too .
yea exactly however i think not trump but some group of people i do n't know much about american politics should 've reviewed the state 's decisions because i 've heard some are dealing with it poorly

caravan is really actually pretty fun and pretty easy .
the easiest way to get the achievement is to have a fun deck that also works well .
first you want to have only 2 suits for number cards and aces .
make sure you have an equal number of each card so 1 ace of spades 1 ace of clubs 1 2 of spades 1 2 of clubs etc .
use those to fix your deck or to sabotage the enemy .
to win you play cards in ascending order or descending order but if you have the same suit for your next card you can switch the direction .
that 's why you keep it to 2 suits .
next you use kings to double a cards value .
i do this to send the enemy over 26 which ruins their caravan .
you can also use jacks to remove cards and prevent them from beating you .
get all 3 caravans on your side to 21-26 and make sure that you are always higher than the opposite caravan .
for some extra shenanigans add in the 2 aces from the suits you do n't use .
play a joker on them and you can remove every card of that suit from the board .
if you do n't have any in that suit in the first place it will only hurt your opponent .

ok no need to be mad at me because you do n't understand things .
a connect account and a bank account are two different things .
again you wo n't see any type of federal payment on the connect account .
if you are receiving payments than you are either eligible for fpuc of pua and your account on connect should say eligible .
also you can see any type of weekly payments by going to the view and maintain account and then click on weekly payments and it will tell you about any payments that you are eligible for .
sorry man you think you 're being clear but your not .

which is why you ca n't have countless branching paths yes .
budget is a restraint but it 's not inherently crippling either .
not to mention actually making your choices matter in a game where the entire premise is that your choices matter is hardly a waste of money .
plus no dragon age game has ever been lacking when it comes to content so it 's not like the players that do n't experience this companion are somehow being massively cheated out here .
not to mention that the entire point of your choices matter is there should be new content for you when you replay .
just make it a right on the rails narrative .
it 's perfectly okay to include content that not everyone sees every piece of content .
for example zevran leliana sten wynne fenris isabela iron bull dorian vivienne sera blackwall cole can all be potentially dead content a player never experiences if they do n't recruit those characters .
i would n't exactly say including them or making their recruitment a choice a waste of money .
same goes for say making garrus a companion in mass effect 3 despite him being potentially killable in 2
should every companion be potentially dead content based on past games ?
is it okay for one companion to be dead content if you say killed them in a past game ?
i 'd say absolutely yes and if anything we need more of that and less shove the character off to the side to never be seen again beyond camels so everyone sees everything by extension making the decision to spare the character pointless .
you ca n't have countless branching paths but if your story is going to be on the rails with minimal divergent content then have it be on the rails entirely and do n't waste money on pointless choices that do n't matter .
not to mention i think it worked relatively well in mass effect minus funneling both characters down the exact same arc not thrilling and actively botching ashley 's writing was gon na happen regardless
i 'm a bit confused ... you 're the primary organizer or it 's 50/50 ?

i was in that situation once with a neighbor .
their drunk assess showed up super late while i was watching their child less than a year old .
i called to find out when they were coming home as i was 1 and my parents were n't happy at 12 when they were supposed to be home at 10 .
i begged them to let my parents pick me up as the dad was blitzed but i was n't allowed to call him and he drove me home drunk .
they still had the nerve to call and ask me to babysit 2 weeks later .

we have chaperone already even though it 's a slug shotgun it 's still the ranged exotic shotgun .
also having a kinetic shotgun which can 2 shot and uses primary and has insane range would be op in crucible no other close quarter primary would be able to compete even exotics why use tarrabar or huckleberry or any other handcannon smg or side up when you can just run a primary shotgun that has an insane ttk with insane range and uses primary .
that 's fair and i do tip occasionally as well for pick-ups when ordering at the small family-owned restaurants .
however i really dislike when the customer is just assumed to tip amount even if service was bad or non-existent .
in my area it 's pretty common for food court places to slap a standard 15-20 tip on top of any orders which is ridiculous .
really wish our tipping culture would change and employers start paying their workers a proper wage to be topped up by an optional tip for exceptional service .

you 're disabling one sound card for another so there has to be output for sound .
the interface will likely be a much better sound card than the onboard one there no reason not to use it full time especially if it comes with its own drivers .
or alternatively have another output source connected to the pc stock card so that all you need to do is switch it over in windows system tray without pissing about with wires e.g .
studio monitors connected to interface with separate desktop speakers connected directly to pc/mobo .
ideally you 'd have an interface with 4 outputs to negate the need to do this cos it 's not exactly efficient to keep switching between devices windows is n't a big fan of that and like i say the interface is likely a better card than the onboard one anyway

i 'm using this as a way to get some of my console-loving friends off their console and onto the pc .
i have friends who only has the game on the ps4 despite being pc owners because peer pressure for some reason seriously .
they got the ps4 version instead because some big name youtuber they 're following is playing the console version .
in the meantime i need more crews in my gang but r does n't allow cross-platform play ...
some ways of fingering a chord are easier relative to other notes you 're playing .
once you pick a note on one string you ca n't pick another on that string so no three notes can be closer than three steps apart
also pollock 's style can be defined as action painting part of the aura is the the fact that a normal painting is just an image but a pollock is also about the idea of movement and the physicality inherent in the traces of paint .
whereas a photo or lito reproduction of his paintings would be just an image
actually one of the gyms has opened an outdoor facility somewhere i read
the core issue is that betty does not love sally .
betty only thinks of sally as an accessory or an extension of herself .
betty wants the picture perfect daughter who is just like her but that 's not how kids work .
sally is struggling to have some semblance of a normal life and to be her own person and betty does not respect this and in certain cases actively exacerbates it so she can ruin sally 's already fragile relationship with don .
betty only really cares about herself and is indifferent to the struggles of other people especially her family .
i really ca n't wait for gyms to be open i hate bodyweight exercises .
that was usually the case for my spider deck but i 've found thresh to be a nice addition to the deck .
i 've tried using several different champions with elise and thresh seems to be the best one so far .

i 'm aware they play bad ships that 's why i said i would love to see play them regularly for like a month .
and not watching any yt video with bad ships means that even they ca n't have good matches in those ships .
i put enforcer on ntl as my cb2 and most ppl run to that side and every now and then i get lucky and pop one loose .
i also have shazier and roquan and tilman at lb who have the speed to get outside and force it inside to peppers or mack .
no matter if they have dickerson or sanders i believe i always have a shot of taking the ball away .
my point is i do n't care how they play .
i 'll take my 10-13 wl wins and get to the playoffs in seasons .
that 's not what makes the game fun for me tho .
i asked because i have no idea about step moms in real life
the cartoon character makes me want to punch a hole through my wall
she 's really messed up in the original game too but this gives us more insight into what 's really going on in her mind and the horrific life she was born into and died from .
last encore gets a lot of hate some of it deserved much of it not imo but they did some really great stuff with the characters throughout .
however i do n't think either of these is really the definition they were going for in choosing the name .
yeah you are right the individual profiteering is n't necessarily doing anything wrong they are just trying to work it 's supplying demand .
it 's up to the local authority to control it to prevent it getting out of hand .
local authorities lost control on housing a long time ago and it will be a struggle to ever get that back .
the switch pro controller is also very good and i personally prefer it due to its layout being more similar to that of xbox controllers offset right thumbstick and i think it looks fantastic .
at the risk of sounding like a major leg humper i feel like i really would n't mind hanging out with jinger ?
i like wan na know what she actually has to say since jeremy has been talking over her for almost 5 years now
i love this game but its definetly dated and not as fulfilling as it once was

discussions which involve suicide in any way do not belong here .
any mention of suicide disqualifies your post from this subreddit .
circumventing this filter with euphemisms will result in a ban .
it does not matter if you are not the one feeling suicidal or if this happened in the past .

posting here is something of a last desperate effort for now anyway .
made up issues about bts or small things that should have been no big deal would get magnified and controversy ie .
bashing '' posts would be posted all over various english and korean kpop forums .
not just once in one post but multiple times .
and not just one day but repeatedly daily day after day month after month year after year until new issues are created and they would overlap to create multiple bashing posts per forum every day .
back then if there was a positive bts post all the replies were about how they still stuck because of this or that controversy .
we survived that both the bts and the armys .
i 'm just glad that these days if there 's some small controversy people complain for that one post and usually that 's that .
there are enough armys around to police repeated re-hashing of issues for sake of bashing .
these days i just look at it go meh '' and that 's that .
i do n't usually assume how bts feels but i would n't be surprised if they 're kind of meh '' about it as well .

so i usually talk to my friends using the xbox app on my pc but the app does n't have any mic filtering so there 's this annoying background static/buzz .

if you ca n't pay your debt you 'll have to go on a crazy road trip across the country to escape the mafia and have all kinds of adventures in a stupid looking car .
you 'll probably fall in love a couple of times too in comical ways .
or you might gradually fall in love with a tough istanbullu lawyer as you try to escape gangsters who want you to pay your absentee father 's gambling debt .
seriously borrowing mafia money has factored into every ibrahim büyükak movie i 've seen so far haha .
i love his movies though the humor translates surprisingly well .
if you end up divorced and living with a divorced istanbul nightclub singer in an old ottoman era mansion and have to pretend to be the father of her daughter so she can get married to an old money family from adana just admit that you sell chandeliers for a living !
if you pretend to be a police commissioner to impress to rich father-in-law the real father might show up all drunk and ruin everything .
does anyone have any suggestions for their favorite movies ?
also does anyone know what was going on in istanbul kırmızısı ?

one day you may find karens going to reddit more often to the point that there will be a subreddit for karens to talk about their children .
because even though reddit has a lot of subreddits talking and making fun of karens karens do n't realize that treating other people like absolute crap and thinking that their child can do no wrong is actually entitled .
so they will come here not realizing that whenever someone makes fun of a karen they are actually making fun of them .
hi all i 'd love some advice from you lovely folks here as i do n't know what to buy and i 'm spending a lot of money !
total budget in local currency and country of purchase .
please do not use usd unless purchasing in the us
i 'm buying in gbp pounds or eur euros in ireland .
for what i 'm looking for i think i need to set the budget at £1200 minimum to £3000 maximum .
i do n't think i 'd really require the need for more money spent on it than that but let me know your thoughts .
if it was worth it i 'd consider breaking the bank a little bit more
how would you prioritize form factor ultrabook 2-in-1 etc .
not too concerned about battery life as running the algorithms and processing large datasets will be draining on the battery anyway i 'm ok to need to plug in .
not particularly interested in a 2-1 style laptop as i want the laptop to function for this purpose only and then just general use .
i do like the appeal of a light laptop and thin screen etc however i am ok with a bulkier machine if it meant there would be higher performance .
and with advances to the hardware anyway i 'm sure the laptop will still be small enough
i do n't work with a second monitor really as much as i 'd like and i like to split screen a lot !
i 'll be running software such as rstudio eclipse pycharm matlab .
if you 're gaming do you have certain games you want to play ?
any specific requirements such as good keyboard reliable build quality touch-screen finger-print reader optical drive or good input devices keyboard/touchpad ?
i 'd love a nice keyboard for once lol !
light up keyboard or i think i would like something like the touch bar from the new macbooks .
i do want the laptop to be nice and appealing as well as just being practical .
a touchpad is necessary and i do want it to have at least the standard port capabilities
leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion .
i want it to be able to cope with and be fast as you would hope for when processing datasets and running packages/algorithms .
i 'd like it to have a sleek os and have high quality resolution/graphics processor and i think i 'd need decent ram ?
i 've always been a windows girl but having been using a macbook 6 years old after my toshiba broke i kind of prefer the cleanness i 'd the design of ios .
but i do have some complaints about it so i would consider other os .
i 'd also like it to stick around for a while 😁i know i ca n't keep it forever if i 'm making it work hard but if i 'm spending a lot of money i 'd want one that can withhold itself for 5 for so years
as i said i love being at school and i 'm also a member of greek life and many other things on campus so a lot of my socializing and events requires campus being open .
however besides from labs and such i ca n't see reopening campus as being a good idea in the slightest .
when i was living at beaty a while back at least half of my floor all caught the same flu/cold .
i also do n't see how testing over 50000 students is feasible .
combined with kids going to mid even right now when they should n't be socializing at each other 's houses and many students i know love to go to trips with their friends to tally atlanta nola or whatever on weekends .
i 'm only making this post because i see so many people praying for campus to reopen which i completely understand as i would die to go back there but just looking at how the kids that are there right now are behaving it just seems like a horrible idea .
and as much as i love mr. fuchs it seems as if the finances of uf and gville which is dependent on students is being prioritized over student health .
i know sisters who would probably shun me for saying this as it seems as if the srats and frats really wan na get things moving again but i 'd rather be safe and healthy then go to a damn date function .
if not why as i definitely could be looking at this the wrong way .
i 've used the pirelli the cinturato p7 all season plus on my 2013 sonic and was very pleased with the results .
i never paid much attention to the mpg 's .
my oe michelin tires are shot at 25k miles .
i certainly was n't happy with the dry or rain performance of those so i definitely wo n't be going oe .
so my question is anyone here put the p7 's on their bolt ?
my other choice is continental 's purecontact ls is grand touring all-season tire .
i know both these will perform better than oe as far as holding the road but how is you range been affected ?
subhanallah we are at the end of another blessed month of ramadan .
how did everyone cope with this year 's ramadan especially with social distancing ?
usually my local community gather every saturday or sunday for big iftaar meal .

this year has been so different i have n't seen my friends in months !
one of my favourite things to do is to pray taraweah with many in the community .
the university lends us a large room especially for this .
that is the steam ss of the item with float and all that fun stuff .

waiting on a response from u/zeebo45 to this message https www.reddit.com/message/messages/oqdd0q .
just looking to see some general discussion and people 's experiences surrounding this !
for me personally i used it to escape my symptoms from a young age 13 and i used it very frequently ...
i believe this played a part in my tendency to dissociate to the extreme which is unfortunate but i 'm sure it would 've been an issue regardless .
i stopped for a couple of years because i felt i was losing it and those years were the most successful of my life .
problem is i picked up alcohol instead at this time .
after i got a good job i thought i was in a stable enough place to handle marijuana but now here i am two years later and i 'm smoking it daily even on my lunch breaks to tolerate the rest of my day .
the problem is it can also make it worse .
for myself i think of it as a bandaid that allows the problem to fester .
personally i 'd like to see myself being able to use it recreationally once a week-month as a way to amplify the moment .
instead i am using it as often as i can to escape the moment .
i 'm not sure if this transition will be possible or if i 'll have to quit altogether ...
i 'm selling my iphone over facebook marketplace and almost immediately after posting i get a message from a guy wanting it for his daughter in florida .
he said he 'd pay me 50 extra to have it shipped there .
he was interested in seeing more photos of the phone which i do n't find suspicious .
he 's asked me to send him a paypal request .
my wife whom i 'm selling it for wants him to pay over venmo he said he wo n't do that as its not as secure .
i decide to look up the cellphone number and find out its a landline .
if i let this guy pay me over paypal is there anyway he can reverse the funds and scam me or am i over thinking this ?
me and my girlfriend have problems doing things together very different personalities so we do n't like the things the other likes for movies series music and so .
i started reading mistborn era 1 and started telling her about it she ignored me for the most part when finished i started reading stormlight and once again started telling her about it .
out of nowhere she started reading mistborn era 1 when i was halfway wor she finished the final empire by the time i finished edgedancer and now we are reading the well of ascension together she 's so excited about the lore of it and is intrigued by how the cosmere works as i told her that skadrial and roshar exist in the same universe .
i 'm really happy that we can share this together and i look forward to get her to read stormlight later .
i 'm playing a war domain cleric in our chult campaign and i 'm the only tank-esque member of the party gaining the heavy armor proficiency and a shield and also the healer .
i was considering dipping a level into barbarian to get the rage ability for the damage resistance .
is this a good build for a healing tank ?
i 've never done a multi class in 5e yet .
does anyone know what flags to print for the new tv wall acrylics ?
i ca n't seem to figure it out ... .
after furiously rage quitting the game for months at a time i finally put in the 11 hours it took to finally take out the final boss for the return ending .
in your opinion who or what was the hardest boss or mini boss for you ?
listened to the first half of colors by between the buried and me .
started out phenomenal but they kinda lost me with all the growling stuff .
and how should i go about getting into the growling stuff i want to like it but i 'm just really not used to it .
on a side note i 'm obsessed with haken what bands/albums would you recommend that are of a similar style ?
sorry for all the questions i 'm really trying to explore progmetal to the fullest it 's a very broad genre
i 'm a non-english speaker and yesterday i was watching daria and my bf heard sandi and ask me why she speaks so weird .
actually i realised that sandi and tiffani speaks really weird but i always thought that tiffani was because she is so quiet and sandi is just posh but did she have and accent of a particular place or anything and i 'm missing something ?
i have done some research work while working based on my understanding of available ieee std and protocols used for designing a chip in eda/vlsi/semiconductor field .
can someone suggest some journals name which will accept the paper to publish ?
also kindly help with how to apply for it ?
also i want to understand will it publishing a research work be helpful for my further research ?
to get this new honey-themed world to show up head to the title screen where you go to create a new world .
enter in the seed field ‘not the bees ' and then your map will look like the one posted above .
during the loading screen you should see a message that says generating bees .
caution for those of you who hate bees this new world might not be for you .
thanks i hate it. either way it 's definitely a fun new world to explore and we wo n't spoil anything for you in this article .
this world is a reference to an achievement that could be unlocked back in the early terraria days called not the bees .
to get that achievement you wear full bee armor items made from bee 's wax and fire your bee weapon
so in have just started using strava a couple of days ago to record my outdoor rides got the apple watch app to go with it .
my main reason for use is to not only record my rides in the activity app but also to generate rides and navigate them having my phone on my handle bar.. great feature..
but when i start a generated route and start tracking my ride neither the watch based app or the native workout watch app play along.. fine do n't really need that .
but frustratingly it does n't spark my watch to track my heart rate .
as far as i can imagine when i would start my ride both on the ios app and the watch app i would end up with two separate activity 's
added the watch to strava in the ios app and all data allowed
has anyone dealt with this and figured it out ?
for hot summers most modern house designs are idiotic .
boxes with black roofs and no verandahs eves or trees .
more windows eves and airspaces could keep them cool in summer .
not to mention people could wear shorts and shirts but insist on suits .
for winter most indoor areas are way over heated .
you could easily deal with far cooler temps if you just kept your warm clothes on instead of peeling them off inside .
if aircon and heating wasnt an option or at least something that could only be used in extreme circumstances sparingly i 'm thinking plus 40c/108f or sub freezing temps we would learn to deal without it .
most modern buildings and habits are built around the assumption that ac is going to be on permanently .
just spend time in a shopping mall when the ac fails on even a mild day and you 'll know what i mean .
hey you should watch this video i promise you wo n't regret it ! ❤️ likee hellolikee
i 'm level 44 so do n't have the regera just yet .
do n't be surprised if you get a call soon honestly .
for the last 2 weeks we 've been starting at 12:30am on preload .
inside we are calling this the covid peak highly likely it extends into christmas peak .
but you have to do what you have to do .
i was about to try and confirm my theory but someone is using my netflix right now so i 'll try to get back to it but if i had to guess it 's running mates s7e10 and they 're discussing if anyone has talked to reporters about leo struggling with vp debate prep ?
lou i have n't spoken to a friend in two months .
annabeth i do n't think i have any friends left .
definitely look into a filter for the exhaust of the tent .
the filter will mostly eliminate the smell if the tent is closed and you have a decent exhaust fan .
in flower your neighbors will probably smell the plants without a filter .
you should be able to get away with vegging for a few weeks to a month without significant smell .
now that we have that settled are you planning on responding to my actual point ?
i believe you were saying the cap k was the best argument though ...
oh wow i did n't even think of watermarking !
they probably were n't cheating in a 4v1 you get demolished it is what it is
the pandemic is n't a valid excuse for the state of the season it takes them at least 6 months to develop a season so long before they were sent home for safety reasons .
i 'd say the shitty state of this season was because it might have been developed during the split with activision that is a valid excuse .
however the pandemic is definitely the reason why they ca n't get fixes out asap they do n't have their resources like they would at the office .
does n't understand that since the place is so packed sometimes you get to your station and someone is there multiple times which is n't your fault and you get tot .
today my new waterspider was sweeping for an hour while my line is completely empty asked him if i still had a water spider because have n't seen him for an hour and he was sweeping he just laughed and said at least he 's doing something then i said his no 1 priority is making sure stowers have work then he said yeah your right .
also am waterpsiders are just filling people 's sleds with just the same item no mixture and they do n't know any better !
it 's ridiculous have n't seen anything like this for 7 months until all these new people .
since the am is new and 80 my team is new they do n't know the rules to even question the am .
i mean it 's pretty much impossible to know the extent that surveillance is used for parallel construction .
there are definitely proven examples of the government overreach like this for a start .

on a similar note have you ever had a zit somewhere at the beginning of your ear canal ?
yea there was probably more nuance there than my neurotype would recognize .
but i will say that the co-crying scene was just flat out amazing all around special props to pugh 's contribution .

is someone else 's math not adding up here or is it just me ?
the main part is made out of craft foam .
i traced the shape on a basic sheet they 're maybe a couple mm thick .
then i gave them a little bit of a seal with a heat gun but i 'm not sure that 's necessary .
finally i sprayed them with plasti-dip in very light layers until they were covered .
you can use a hairdryer to warm them and give them a bend .
the pouch i made from a small mold that i also made using milliput and the clip on pouch from the first order deluxe stormtrooper but i 'm sure any pouch you want to use would work .
after the mold is dry you can just use more milliput and sand them down with a rotary tool after they cure .
the underarm strap is just a small piece of elastic that i got from my local fabric store .
iirc they did some shady stuff with captain marvel as well like deleting negative reviews .
i am ready to yeet myself through a window but other then that pretty chill hbu ?
good point lol well mostly the cat but the prospector is there to help .
when ever the cat bankrupts me the prospector is there to drag me out of financial ruin

i graduated with a bachelor 's on the same semester i started smoking .
it was also a semester i almost blew because of my declining cognitive abilities at the time .
the decline only got worse and worse as the years went by until i quit the drug one and a half years ago .
the change was noticeable both while smoking as well as after quitting and other than that not much else changed in my life .
i never claimed weed stopped development of my prefrontal cortex in fact i clearly stated i started smoking after the commonly known maturity age of 25 years of the brain .
while there are a few factors involved the fact is weed affected my cognitive abilities dramatically and i have years of experience as well as witnesses to back it up .
while i 'm glad weed has n't affected your intellect as much do n't assume everyone will be affected the same way .

light.gg has very terrible recommendations for weapons and most of them are biased for pc if you play on console you 're looking for completely different perks .
i can do just about any of them off the top of my head .
most youtubers make gimmicky builds rather than ones that are completely functional .
gimmicks are great but if you 're looking for a new best friend for life '' build in gambit i would n't be looking to them .
they fail at various circumstances are assuming things are happening a shattering blade build '' is the kind of bad gimmick that comes to mind or overcommit to one thing using osmosis with nezrac 's is usually excessive and hurts your build for example .
i 'd recommend a lot of self testing when it comes to builds but weapons are pretty clear cut .
she was a girl who was turned into a snake then got adopted by cobra .
momma always said onions and meats is best friends and need to be close to each others
no it would leave many people unsatisfied and make the series worse .
rick does n't have anything more to add with percy and annabeth apart from a couple of appearances in mc and toa .
having books to decide what happens with annabeth and percy takes away the imagination of what happens .
kind of like what j.k. rowling did with harry potter it was good until the cursed child .
i did n't even see this when i posted it
unfortunately i still have n't solved it and am still locked out of my account this is a ridiculous issue and they should have a way to support us instead of leaving us out to dry
i disagree seeking to establish a name for yourself through violent acts is not looking to create political change .
in the end its semantics but when you look at the psychology of these killers mass serial etc .
they all tend to fit into typical categories with similar motives modus operandi character traits and even factors in their upbringing that influence their behavior .
the definition of martyrdom is not something i would care to delve into suffice to say that seeking to be idolized by a certain group of people and seeking political change are not the same thing .
anyone who commits an atrocity such as a mass killing for selfish motives will almost certainly be a sociopath whereas most normal '' people can be coerced into committing an attrocity in the name of a higher power belief system or government if they believe the cause is just .
again this is just semantics but it is important to note these differences if you want to examine the problem and look to solutions for prevention and detection .
just because in the age of the internet these communities have the ability to get together and encourage eachother does not make them a terrorist organization .
the problem is that the stupid people ca n't be trusted with reasonable precautions so they ruin it for everyone .
i was waiting in line at a store where they had spots on the floor six feet apart while you wait in line .
all of a sudden the woman behind me decided she absolutely had to get a soda out of the soda case right that second .
she 's squeezing around me to get her diet coke maybe four inches from me .
the goofiest part is while she was distracting me the line had moved up so had she waited 10 seconds she would have been standing next to the soda cooler .
there 's an amped up guy at the front talking loudly and gesticulating to the cashier neither wearing masks .
he suddenly decides he needs a peanut butter cup so he walks to right where i 'm standing and reaches over my shoulder to get his candy .
there 's a percentage of people that are just too clueless to be trusted to exercise reasonable and moderate precaution .
worked for me granted this was last year not sure if the regs have changed .
displaying text in monospace is all this tag does .
if you want to display the h1 '' and h1 '' you would need to do so with the respective codes for the characters like so

so basically 6 months have already gone by and now you 're just 6 months til the contract expires ?
what have the other people in the team done ?
have you asked if they have asked for raises 6 months in ?
does the contract say anything about raises or work review ?
because i remember that in my contract they specify that the review for salary increase only happens yearly .
and i mean i kinda agreed to that so i ca n't just ask in the middle of the year .

honestly it depends on the person whether or not the condescension is just perceived by the audience or deliberately intended by the person .

black is primary in general creature removal whereas white is secondary .
it 's not different enough to be in a different category .
no one would look at consign to the pit and iona 's judgement and say well we ca n't compare these one exiles and the other destroys '' .
both would invite comparisons on the relative strength of each color 's removal .
i also question whether a white mage banishing something from existence is the most defining characteristic of white .
while black may have some cards better than path if white is regularly getting paths then black must be regularly getting paths .
considering how much of an impact path still has on older formats i question whether this is a good idea

you mentioned your universities job board that 's a good start .
i also highly recommend talking to your professors in your major they are great resources and have connections .
that 's how i 've gotten both of my internships .
i became close with 2 of my env science professors and they have provided me with great opportunities due to their connections and our mentor-mentee relationship .

just popped in to say that this sounds really similar to an issue i was having .
i also have an lg he top loader with no agitator .
i also fill to 2/3 with nothing larger than a cloth flat .
i usually only run one — very long — cycle .
my machine has an option on the dial to do a regular prewash. the prewash is cold according to the instruction manual and i dial up the heat of the main wash to extra hot .
then you can press a button for an extra rinse so i do that .
i put a full cap of all/tide free clear i 've used both and did n't notice a difference that is added to the main wash according to the manual .
i was having a weird issue that sounds similar to yours where they smelled fine coming out of the washer and not great coming out of the dryer .
after testing some things more and less detergent more and less bulking etc i suspected my microfiber of holding smells .
i was hitting up my local used cloth diaper sale soon anyway so once i got my new-old diapers i decided to freshen up everything .
i used mighty bubbles according to package directions then did a bleach wash. then i kept my microfiber in a drawer and replaced with the natural fibers i had just picked up .
notably though i was not having any ammonia issues .
but everything else about your story sounded eerily similar to what i experienced so i thought i would share .
is it possible that your microfiber is holding weird smells ?
even if you ca n't replace it maybe doing a mighty bubbles and then bleach wash would freshen it up and you could see if that 's the issue ?
there are misspellings in the subject line for christ 's sake .
you said it would work on the first try .
here a man was simply jogging down the street and two white men shot him .
if it was a white man do you think they would have shot him ?
tldr i got monologue 'd when i asked for help .
ha your story reminds me of something similar that happened to me around your age .
i was looking for a job at the time and while walking through the mall i spotted a bookstore 'why not ' i thought .
i did n't have my resume on me at the time so i thought i would ask someone who worked there how they wanted people to apply/submit resumes etc and come back later .
there was a guy standing at an info booth at least twice my age .
feeling really nervous and unsure of myself i wanted to ask him for advice .
something like 'hey if i was to apply here what would be the best way to do it ? '
he looked pissed off i think and started looking around the shop sneered and then said something like i shit you not
like some discount actor playing a b movie villain ruling over a bookstore of like 8 people .
i was stunned all i could do was just look straight at him and then walk out .
it took me a long time to accept that just because someone looks like an adult it does n't mean they will act like one .
people will come at you with all sorts of weird shit you had no idea about and could never have been expected to know .
and whatever it it probably is n't about you as weird as it sounds .
looking back at it now maybe the guy just got divorced or found out a parent died .
does n't make it right but you also probably do n't have any way of knowing .
it sound like you 're doing great anyway but the moral of this story is do n't let people acting like that get to you .
also the bookstore went bankrupt a few years later so fuck that guy .
i would like to use my laptop as a secondary display without the specs and use my pc for the workflow .

if you do n't have a script you can ask them to prescribe one and they 'll ask which pill you were on .
i did it when i was without insurance it was like 10 a month plus they send it in a discrete box with tons of goodies !
okay so just to clarify your point is that everything anyone does is to make themselves feel good about themselves but the reason you dont like what these folks are doing is because you think it 's only to make them feel good about themselves ?
it 's a mix between real time strategy and civ-like turn based strategy

she really was overshadowed by the number of exceptional cooks this season and sadly her mind was n't there in the masterchef kitchen but rather with her son which is quite understandable too .
the treaty itswlf wasnt as bad as it seems the enforcement of it was the problem afterwards .
as jesse from the great war said it it was the best compromise the allies could havegotten under the cirquimstances '' or something along the lines .
when britain and france were left to uphold the treaty being the nations suffering heavily from the war in terms of men and resources instead of the outsider usa the whoöe provess was problematic
why do you all hate tik tok that much ?
it 's just an other app for different kind of people if it really hurts you just ignore and do n't watch tik tok .
i mean it obviously has to be the 25th round of a startup lol
i even commented there today like 10 minutes ago to prove it .
i have n't been trolling r/boruto for 2 years ... he just saying that cause no one is going to look that far and check to prove it ... ..
he has two of his post removed on me and this is the third ones is so creepy ...
normally i would just block him but he seems obsessive with me and i do n't know what he will say if i ca n't see it..

we have a very open system of allowing people into colleges compared to other countries but we still do not just admit anyone especially not into exclusive schools which tend to offer graduates higher expected earnings .
that will not get better by making college free to the students .
most classes have good pve now though with the exception of maybe tamer which is still behind others .
i 've said it before but i 'll still never understand that .
here 's a picture of a steak/burger/me eating '' sent to the people who protest in slaughterhouses catch it on film and watch documentaries like earthlings or dominion when you could never sit through them .

my boyfriend used to work at a vet clinic and he said that if you pay to get your pet cremated they burn the body with other pets .
only like 10 of the ashes you receive would be your actual pet .
one customer caught on when she had her chihuahua cremated and the weight of the ashes was more than her dog weighed .
i dislike when federal authorities try to intrude on provincial authority even if they are trying to be indirect about it like in this article .
if a province wants to implement universal child-care let them have do it .
anything pertaining to education or early childcare is n't really something the feds should be focusing on .
he is catching from someone 's property and releasing in wild .
it is illegal to keep these as pets or rear them in india

you need to wake up and realize how badly you are being infiltrated when obvious astroturf can make you forget your allies
you would simply be prompted to ask for directions i.e .
they remind me of a bigfoot which is ape-like .
your will is your last words to your children .
do you really want your last statement to your daughter to be so excluding and judgmental ?
always meet up somewhere public first just so you can see how you feel about him in person and to make sure you 're not getting a creepy vibe .
the last thing you want is to already be in a hotel room or his house etc when you meet then realize he 's not what you thought and need to get out .
i 'd recommend meeting up for a coffee first then if you feel ok go ahead with plans .
also tell a friend where you 're going and to expect updates and have an escape plan just in case .
if the guy is not ok with you meeting him briefly first before sex find one that is !

of course this could be fought in court but if somebody was doing it as a group of members so it was privately held could they get away with it ?
it 's certainly not my area of expertise and it may not be yours either .

mid may was the target for the api release it 's not it 's own app but a 'service ' countries can build into their own app .
have n't heard if the target had slipped do perhaps today .
for google at least mondays and wednesdays have traditionally been release days for apps/os updates .
the question is what kind of axe opponents you been fighting ?
i think it firing both shots at once is a little overpowered since if one hit hits the other is basically guaranteed to hit the target as well maybe if the barrels were n't on top of eachother it would work better but i still think there would be more skill involved if both shots did n't fire at once
i understand how they can be distracting and can probably relate to your experience .
to be fair in most states it 's legal to fire anyone for pretty much any reason .

omg is n't it so frustrating when all they say is what ?
i found this sub when someone linked me to it after a heated discussion in r/losangeles about some dickhead protesting a landlord .
i defended the landlord and got a bunch of commies replying that landlords are scum blah blah blah .
i ended up here and enjoyed the memes for the most part .
my problem with this sub is that i ca n't tell if many of the posts are sarcasm or real .
many of the posts have a huge amount of disdain for tenants in general which seems like the wrong position .
i rationalized that it 's probably poking fun at the far-left by acting like shitty landlords just to piss them off .
i enjoy the thought of them crying for free-shit on landlord dime and not getting it but not all tenants are chapos in disguise .
i ca n't tell if it 's all jokes and my guess is people in the middle ca n't either .
not sure this is productive in the grand scheme of things
r/offbeat would fit better but that sub is n't as popular .

in my opinion india should focus more on china rather than pakistan because it is china who made pakistani military powerful gave pakistan nuclear weapons and is protecting pakistan 's economy from crashing down .
also the border crossings from pakistan did not increase after india included pok in weather forecasts it actually increased when the spread of chinese virus corona virus started pakistan is trying its best to gain from the pandemic and so is china .
china is not just aggressive with india rather when their virus started spreading china became aggressive in south china sea also .
also we can not trust america no matter who is in power as relations of india with america is new so we need be carefull regarding america doing anything too crazy could have unpredictable consequences .
also pushing aggressively on pok is not possible as we are going through a crisis china and pakistan can do so because they do not care much about their citizens also the indian military is taking required measures .
to summarize china is not trying to distract india from pok this just the common behaviour of china .

i 've tried what muting and playing ... but like i said does n't change the fact that players are braindead and it 's not fun .
go apply your effort and try to get people to ward more do n't come to me telling me to change my play style based on peoples ' inability to critically think .
it 's not hard to ward it 's not hard to walk to dragon when its called multiple times 1 minute before it 's up .
its not hard to do most things people are failing to apply themselves in .

maybe your therapist is still trying to figure out the focus of the sessions ?
as a therapist-in-training we do try to address more immediate issues like a pandemic and i 'm betting a lot of therapists are maxed out in terms of emotional reserves .
i 'm the same way i get frustrated when my therapist says you need to be more compassionate with yourself but i also tend to repress anger so i 'm not aware of that anger till weeks later .
i recently said to my therapist look when you tell me that i need to be nicer to myself or whatever i literally do n't know what to do .
i do n't know what that looks like and i do n't know how to use it when my six-year-old self pops up and thinks that people are hostile .
you 're telling me to cut hair on the back of my head without a mirror .
it 's worth a shot to communicate to your therapist how her words make you feel .
i know it sucks to feel like you have to handle everything on your own all over again but your therapist hopefully is willing to bear some of the weight and show you how .
it 's just that your therapist like all therapists is n't a mind-reader and is n't always aware of how her words impacted you .

when i jump through my bash history i have this weird visual bug that as soon as i reach a sudo command i think it is only sudo it stays at the start of any other command from history .
when i execute a command it is run without sudo .
i also experience some weird behavior when moving with arrow keys through long commands that are spanning 2 or more lines .
the cursor then completely goes apesh\*t and jumps diagonally up the terminal buffer .
has anyone had this issue and managed to fix it ?
i tried different terminal emulators and all show the same behavior so i guess this is a bash thing .
tell me what 's been going through that head of yours .
is there anything you need to get off that chest ?
regarding the changes of the last update i wanted to make a suggestion about the personal storage items .
personally i use the button to pick all the things in my piggy bank a lot for organizing stuff but it also happens to pick my money and some items that i like being in the piggy too so for example if i forgot to put my money back and i die i lose all the money .
this is kinda annoying for me and could be easily solved if we have the ability of mark favorites in your personal storage items too like you do in your normal inventory so you can pick up fast just the things you want without losing money or other unintended items .
i 've been playing a lot of duo showdown lately trying to push my some of my 600 brawlers to 750 .

i do n't even understand how people can be so dumb at this trophy range .
there are very few actually good mortis players that i 've come across and they do n't even press play again sadly .
but the majority of the time it is these dumb idiots who think they 're mortis gods just because they have unlocked the coiled snake starpower and it 's annoying to deal with them .
just wanted to know is it just me or do y'all get these types of idiots on your team too or any other annoying or just simply dumb brawlers .

if you look back at hajime from arifureta naofumi from shield hero and subaru from re zero they have something in common they thought transporting to another world will mean instant cheat powers and get a harem automatically .
he knew he was in another world but work every blood and bone to get what he wants because he knows what dangers there are except he overestimates them which is why he is op .
also he tries hard to avoid getting a harem because it does not fit his dream .
however he is actually doing that will impress the ladies .
if he had just try to act clean and nicely and say a few fancy words like visual novel protagonists do they would have not been interested in him .
he did the opposite and did things naturally rather than force them .

i was able to place my order at exactly 10pm pst for the pdx ikea !
ok so home girl is trying to get some goods to redo her bedroom from ikea .
i have been trying to order and pick up through click and collect but i have had no luck .
when i try to order through click and collect i get the message we have received our maximum order capacity for the day for this location .
i have read several threads about ikea 's click and collect and various reset times but nothing specifically about our ikea .
i 've tried to order at 10pm pst and 12am pst .
i do not want to have my order delivered because 50 is quite steep for delivery and the soonest delivery dates are out in late june !
what is the portland or ikea click and collect reset time ?
has anybody had success with click and collect from portland or ikea since the pandemic ?
if so at what time did you make your order ?
thank you all so much and i wish you all the best in your endeavors .
as my user flair says i 'm 15 and i 'm the only person in my friend group that has n't even had their first kiss yet some have lost their virginity and i 'm worried i 've waited too long and now it 's too late .
like if i has the opportunity to kiss someone i 'd have no idea what 's happening or what to do i had the chance to kiss a girl that was super important to me last year but it did n't feel right like me and her just felt wrong but that 's besides the point .
idk if i 'm looking for reassurance or motivation or what but let me know what you think about this whole thing .
edit i 'm from a small town in australia and it 's normal for people round here to have lost their virginity by 15 someone i know even lost it at 14 .
i 'm looking on getting parts for my pc build .
so far i have buy all the supplies but the case the psu and the air cooler .
all i 'm looking to buy are from corsair .
perhaps there are issues with the stocking due especially with the pandemic going on ?
air cooler icue h150i rgb pro xt 75 cfm liquid cpu cooler or h150i pro 47.3 cfm liquid cpu cooler
i saw that the icue 465x being in-stock for about 10 more on newegg we 're i think there was price gouging on the rmx by newegg .
i 'm have been getting stressed out recently and i do n't know when it will be back in stock .
i tried to contact corsair support about the items status in stock .
i heard that corsair are appealingly not taking anymore order on their own site .
are there any discontinued or more stocks should be on the way ?
maybe give me the estimate on when it will be back in stock ?
how to enlarge your pennies with your hands in 2 weeks
if you are thinking about the possibilites of having a large penis then the answer is yes .
it is possible and also within a very short time .
but for this you have to follow some excersises and do them the proper way .
men think that penis exercise is like a muscle exercise .
try to flex it so it goes from ultra-soft to ultra-hard in a split second .
exercises are n't the answer to getting a bigger penis because the penis is n't a muscle that you can mound .
many times men actually do damage to their penis by forcing blood inside .
their penises end up bent or even broken in the worst cases .
there 's a smart way to increase your penis size ... we 'll cover that in a minute .
since you are doing these routines while taking a nice hot shower warming your penis is already done ... with the hot shower !
just let the water hit your manhood for about 2 minutes .
even though warming up is very quick and easy do not i repeat do not underestimate the importance of warming your penis up prior to doing natural male enhancement .
retract your foreskin and grasp your phallus behind its head/glans firmly .
pull it outwards with enough force to feel painless stretch inside your shaft .
repeat steps 2 to 4 but this time pull it upwards to your belly button .
repeat but this time pull it downwards to your knees .
repeat but this time pull it to your left side .
take your time to go through a cool down phase .
i highly recommend you to promote your growth and results with proper supplements .
it 's common knowledge that kegel exercises are beneficial to women 's health in a variety of ways .
however very few men know that you can significantly improve the blood flow and quality of your erections .
your dick will look larger just by maintaining more control over the erection itself !
this involves just massaging or lightly masturbating in order to achieve temporary natural looking size .
obviously this one is going to take a trial period to find out what works best .
too much massaging can lead to an erection and that 's not the kind of natural size we are after .
give it a week or so to find out just how much or how little is required to achieve a naturally looking larger penis .

on last thursday i was leveling the character by taking mara boost .
on that day i take 7 or 8 runs .
at that time i just afk and watching video on youtube .
suddenly i disconnected and the message said that my account was banned .
i checked the email and find it said i was banned for hacks/bots .
i was confuse why is this reason i did n't use that .
i played this account for like 10 years and got no banned because i never ever use the cheat/bot or hacks .
from that day i have sent like 4 tickets to blizzard .
i asked them what reason i got banned and i did nothing just leveling by the carry .
on the first mail it seems like a auto response .
and the 2nd and 3rd response like the auto response too .
just ask me to check the policies but i did nothing wrong ! ! .
at this morning i got a response seems like a real person replied .

it 's getting worse last week has been utter hell and there 's 4 more days of self loathing being in a haze rumination hopelessness and unproductivity i need to endure and honestly i 'd feel better dead .
i did tell my doctor about feeling worse around my period but i do n't think he took me seriously although he did put me on some calcium and iron supplements that have n't helped much .
maybe it 's time for me to see a gynecologist ?
it will be hard to talk to it about with my mother so she can book an appointment .
i 'm just scared of how she 'll react .
she 's always been there too help when i faced any medical challenges but i do n't know about mental ones .
i 'd do it myself if i was n't 16 .
but i feel like i 'd get much better with proper medication maybe just antidepressants .
ookkkay bye i 'm going to stay in bed for the next 4 days .
i feel like that alice in chains lyric heaven beside you hell within.
nas duas últimas semanas eu comecei a ler mais sobre estoicismo e fui acompanhando o r/stoicism .
essa foi a única filosofia que eu li a respeito e deu aquele clique de que era o mais perto do que eu via como certo .
sem ter ninguém pra falar sobre decidi postar no stories mesmo com pé atrás de ninguém falar nada perguntando se alguém conhecia e se gostava de falar de filosofia .
a parte boa desse relato é que essa filosofia tem me ajudado a afastar os pensamentos negativos sobre todas as situações .
se eu não posso controlar não devo me castigar mentalmente e emocionalmente por aquilo ou pelo menos tentar hehe .
ainda sim sinto falta de alguem que me dê atenção responda as minhas coisas e se importe pela conversa .
não consigo agir senão dessa forma com quem conheço tento o máximo ser virtuoso nessas coisas mas no fim parece que meus assuntos são chatos sei que não são no geral .
não sei como acabar o desabafo mas tirar isso do peito já me aliviou .

as i write this a storm has just blown in .
there 's a strong driving wind outside cf acts 2:2 .
lightning is darting throughout the sky and powerful blasts of thunder shake the windows .
i hear sirens from fire trucks police cars and a tornado warning .
it seems like this storm is turning the town upside down .
tomorrow we begin praying the pentecost novena nine days of fervent prayer to prepare for receiving a new outpouring of the holy spirit on pentecost .
what storm will result if you receive the holy spirit during or after this novena ?
you must leave your job as did st. joseph mt 2:14
you start a new job which becomes the launching pad for a new ministry acts 18:3 5
you pack up and move where the spirit leads acts 18:1
you lose your spiritual mentor jn 16:17 and have to step out and take leadership as did the apostles
you step out in bold obedience to the holy spirit and because of that your church is instantly divided acts 18:4ff
many hear the word of god and come to believe in jesus acts 18:8 or
you shake '' off the spiritual and physical debris left by the storm acts 18:6 and undaunted continue bearing fruit in the power of the spirit see mt 7:24-25 .
receive the holy spirit '' jn 20:22 and let him stir '' up your world 2 tm 1:6 .
prayer father may i be more concerned with being separated from the holy spirit than i am with having to endure upheaval .
promise '' your grief will be turned into joy . ''

soooo i finally finished the show after posting about bits and pieces about it here for the last month .
i decided its only fair that i leave my musings after i finished the entire thing .
first off i just wan na say i loved the show a lot more than i expected and by the end of it i was way more invested in alternate characters and storyline vs. who jane ends up with .
is there a section that is reserved for neither team rafael and neither team michael ?
i wanted jane in a relationship that really pushed her as a person not someone who was always agreeing with her .
not someone who was always halfway up her ass .
rafael and micheal both put their careers/dreams on the back burner not so jane could be happy but so she could have a sense of security .
of course in the long run this is gon na cause resentment .
both of these relationships were romance without any 'real ' conflict or obstacles .
or maybe that 's just my cyncisim peaking through .
i honestly did n't care who she ended up with when raf and her broke up after michael shows up i really was like okay moving on ?
i made a post here a couple of days ago talking about how they really tapped into jane 's neurosis and controlling tendencies and not in a good way .
with season 5 i get most people do n't like the season here but i thought she had a lot of redeeming qualities show up again .
she was n't thrown in my face so constantly every single thing she did seemed to keep in mind how others would feel or react .
when she did decide to explore with michael i honestly was n't upset about it .
it was something that unless you 're really really emotionally controlled there 's no way you would n't think what if ?
raf 's reaction was fucked up but then again i was n't upset about that either .
he was hurt he lost his filter and it really showed .
overall her as a person the goody two shoes bit is fine with me when it was n't excessive like the second half of season 4 its who she is .
but when she forgets others are going through pain as well that 's when i get annoyed .
i do admire how hard she works at everything though .
not just her career but her relationships as well .
her limbo in choice of men was human the men could have chosen to walk away .
i do wish she had gone to therapy out of all the characters after michael i feel she had the least amount of growth .
she evolved a lot but there was def room for more improvement .
i also love her mannerisms the breathing the lip-biting the tongue licking her lips .
lol i have no idea it just made her more jane to me maybe its a gina thing ? .
imma chick by the way if that makes any difference
i dont know what they were going for here .
but after his adhd diagnosis it did make more sense that things were just wicked difficult for him .
he 's a brat but he 's also a miracle child hence the family treating him as such which i think people forget .
the twins were just weird and mateo had his own quirks .
he gets way to much hate here what was he 5 by the time the series ended ?
kids arent perfect no matter how much you discipline and control them .
shes got her own charm and place in the show but i learned to like her from afar .
just because she reminds me so much of my own mother .
but one thing i admire her for no matter how much her offspring and families did n't align with her values she always stuck by them .
she did n't abandon anyone her door was always open to xo and jane .
it was nice to see how juxtaposed her and xo were and the role it played in jane 's personality .
her journey was beautiful to witness from start to finish .
shes an underrated character when it comes to growth .
not for the same reasons people dislike him here .
i do n't care if he likes to be waited on hand and foot that 's between him and alba .
but the way he did n't even try to be involved or get to know alba 's family .
that was a bit of a shocker for me .
rogelio raf michael all make a very conscious effort to get to know xo alba and jane .
that 's why it just seemed like he used alba .
for me alba 's true love was mateo that was the dude i wanted to meet .
that was the man that was flawed but loved alba their family and all the baggage with it .
and upto a certain point i also believed i was team michael .
until it seemed like he had no real role of his own except being ro 's sidekick and jane 's epic romance .
he did n't have any layers nor did he make jane work for their relationship .
now michael coming back from the dead was a total 180 for me .
i get it they had to bring him back for the telenovela effect .
his fiance or gf or charlie whatever she was it all seemed like they were really set on ruining his character to make everyone root for raf .
i have never seen a man literally just ooze so much sex appeal with his smile .
his kids and his life just changed everything about him .
he was content not being a millionaire he was content not being a workaholic .
but that seemed like too much of a change ?
raf the stay at home dad just seems unrealistic .
and also no girl completely changes any man to that extent .
he 's one of my favorite characters when isolated from the jane paradigm .
in reality i would have been team raf all the way if he just gave more pushback voiced his opinions more often and was just a little bit more sure of himself .
i feel he almost thought the villanuevas were a normal family so he should just go along with whatever they say so his life and kids life sembles some kind of normal .
i love that woman from start to finish of the series .
i aspire to have that backbone be that emotionally gratuitous while being the scary lady .
the cherry on the top was at the end when magda shows up and she 's not bothered at all she has that realization that she won .
at the beginning of the series she was her lackey .
with tremendous growth the one time i sobbed and had to pause in the entire series was when raf and jane fight over having petra as the person standing next to them during their wedding .
her standing in that mint green dress and just being petra .
jane deserves so many kudos to giving the woman a chance giving that woman a family she always deserved .
the one thing i will repeat is i very much disliked her with jr. she was n't right for her petra was on constant eggshells that entire relationship .
she deserved to be cherished and appreciated for all the progress she made .
petra is nobody 's second choice and the person she became was all her own doing .
ro is either loved or hated by the fans and i get that .
but he is that one character that has this air of innocence and nativity and i think it comes across as self-obsessed .
which he knows he is self obsessed but he has that awareness !
he knows when the people that love him need him he is that pillar of strength that everyone leans on and they do n't even know they 're doing it .
he gives such sound advice in such few words whenever anyone asks him for it .
he worked his ass off he 's funny he 's over the top he 's so confident in his masculinity with his makeup and wardrobe .
everyone deserves the hype man that is rogelio as a father friend husband .
she like ro had this beautiful self-awareness and ability to communicate when things hurt her or what was on her mind .
people will say that the cancer made here grow up .
i disagree i think her journey was always going in the direction it did .
the mother she is to jane jane is one lucky kid .
she had her flaws but she embraced them or worked on them .
what really made xo come to light in my eyes was the conversation she had with rogelio prior to her making her mastectomy decision .
her entire character made sense in that one conversation .
my favorite couple on the show hands down is xo and ro .
they are made for each other they worked hard they communicate they acknowledge flaws they compromise and they love fiercely .
this is the team i 'm on team rogelio and xiomara .
it hit so many points on blended families adult education being lost depression making the best of the crap handed to us .
but they also missed on and glossed over a lot of stuff that in reality would have been discussed at length .
i.e raf and jane 's opposing religious beliefs and jane 's hope that one day raf will change his mind about having more kids .
the editing the fantasy sequences the over imagination or inanimate objects coming to life gold .
i thought it was gon na be corny but once you get used to it you love it .
loved every minute of watching it few episodes here and there that i would skip in future rewatches but it was a really nice reprise from reality .
ps4 i started a selling mission the insurgent got the car to like half the 1st destination and i hoped out of gta for a bit to go to the gallery menu of the ps4 to check something and when i rejoined the money were in my account and the mission over happend to anyone ?

this is the 59414th time i made this shitty comment .
specifically for the faculties that require an 80 average with no courses below 70 i.e .
all i can find on the western website are the requirements but no statistics .
i 'm trying to see if its possible to display random content on a repeating local notification .
from my understanding once the repeating request is added to the notificationcenter the content is static .
the easiest case i 've been trying is having an array of names and repeat a notification but every time it says hello '' to a different person .
i have a client that extensively uses itunes for media library management and playing of media .

here are the images for the lighter https imgur.com/a/65ul2ro https imgur.com/a/65ul2ro
i have seen this lighter called a golden prince on some websites and its also called a spitfire on others .
the only information about it that i am certain about is that it is an evans pocket lighter .
i am having some trouble getting it to work .
i have not put any fuel in it because i can not get it to strike .
i am not sure what the problem could be .
i put new flint in it when i got it but it still did not strike .
i was wondering if these older lighters used a different kind of flint or if the striker needed to be replaced .
i am hoping it is not the latter because i know little to nothing about these old lighters .
i have celeste and saharah trapped in my entrance/market area .

i am shipping a medium sized package from the us to germany and need to add insurance for us 1,000 .
in the add insurance and extra services '' section the website copy states
priority mail international™ shipments containing merchandise are insured for up to 200.00 at no additional charge .
additional insurance coverage may be purchased at the sender 's option .
unfortunately there is no way to input insurance values in this section see image below .
i tested in a few different browsers no luck .
and adding insurance works fine when generating domestic labels .

i am scheduled to have a d c on friday for my second missed miscarriage in 6 months .
we are planning to do genetic testing this time see if there is any information to be gathered from that about what going on .
my concern is that i 've started very lightly spotting just seeing it when i wipe and had a tiny bit of tissue .
i 'm very worried about starting to pass this naturally and lose the opportunity to have anything to test .
i have an appointment with my dr tomorrow to go over the procedure for friday i just do n't know what happens if i start really bleeding before then .
if i start bleeding more heavily and/or cramping is there something my dr can do to still be able to test genetics without the d c ?
she mentioned previously before we decided on d c that there are kits that allow you to catch stuff and send it off for testing but that sounds traumatic .
this is the parking assist module '' aka the rf antenna for the keyless entry remotes on 06 panthers .
i believe this also is for the tpms signals but i am not 100 .
it is located in the passenger c-pillar up by the radio antenna receiver in all 06 civilians and all 08 cvpis .
i am looking to see if anyone knows what the part number for the wire pigtail is or what the pigtail is called or if it is used for anything else on the car so i can look it up .
i want to add factory rke to my 2007 p71 which i have heard is possible by adding this module and plugging it into the ddm then enabling rke in forscan and going through the programming procedure and then jumping the trunk relay if i so choose .
if i can snag the pigtails for 5-10 a piece from ebay i would prefer that as opposed to hunting through junkyard cars i bought the module itself for 10 but it does n't have the pigtail and i need two pigtails to install it anyway .
i have a severely front-end damaged 2008 that i could just snip the pigtails out of but i would prefer not to as i am looking to sell the car as a parts car and do n't want to pull that from the car in case the next owner wants to fix it and retain rke for it or has the same idea as me and wants to add it to their 06 or 07 cvpi which is why i bought another module instead of just pulling it out of this car .
any help would be appreciated i am also going to post this on cvn and see if anyone on there knows .
the first time i tried to install bleemsync i think i messed something up i do n't remember what and the console 's led would take forever to even light up .
i uninstalled it and redid the process properly and it eventually worked well enough for a few weeks .
however now i seem to have an issue where half the times i turn it on the console will automatically shut down right before the bleemsync boot menu and i have to unplug and re-plug the charger after which it runs .
is this a bleemsync problem or a charger problem ?
using a 5.0v 1.0a asus phone charger which connects directly to the console rather than using the cable provided in the box .
i think the charger might be the problem as i ran into this exactly once while using stock ui after correctly installing bleemsync .
the charger is connected to a nobreak so that may be a factor as well .
if its by cop i would like to first do something to draw as much police attention as possible .
at least make it a show who knows someone might get a kick out of the footage .
edit there will be no death by cop or falling i have found another method that better suits my desires .
am i the only one confused on why aang 's guru said that the last chakra or whatever is blocked by things that tie you to the world when in the words of the air nomad avatar before aang that an avatar 's duty is to the world ?
check out the index for all of the chapters and links to other stories .
as i expected i was unable to penetrate the great walls of the primordial tower .
i stayed nonetheless among the shadow of the mountain to enjoy the peace of it .
i have trouble describing it when the magic in the area is so thick to mutate wildlife beyond the norm .
insects with crystal shells plants that had an electrical current to them beasts merged with the very rock itself and so much more .
i unfortunately had to leave before i could continue my research .
a yenvark union advance company moved into the area and out of fear of an opposing nation showing up and causing a raucous of noise i moved on .
i decided to go north into the union 's territory .
a nation open to non-humans living amongst them so freely is not a common trait so off i went to learn more .
it did not take long though for me to realize why a free spirit such as i could never prosper here .
the stream flowed quickly the water clear and cool to the touch .
the occasional small fish spotted for its scales reflecting the rays of sun that broke the forest canopy darted through the swift current .
the soft sound of the running water added to the somber tone of the forest .
animals moved from their slumber at a slow pace trying to shake off the morning 's chill .
in the shadowy distance of the forest a flickering flourish of lights trailed behind a bird flying between the trees .
his attention was affixed to it as it went from branch to branch .
lead when are you going to share with us the next move ?
bryce shook his head disturbed from the show of beauty as he turned to zel who was crouched by the stream 's side busied with filling up a canteen .
liarie and i are still deciding for now there 's nothing to say.
zel screwed his canteen closed and sat back on the grassy embankment .
come on you both are too secretive with these plans of yours .
you 've got ta share something at least with me !
at some point zel bryce replied bluntly and looked past zel to the other three further down the length of the stream gathering their own water and scouting ahead .
let 's worry about getting back to the others without any confrontations with luncal.
you keep saying things like that lead and we 're sure to have it happen.
if it happens then we simply failed to avoid it. bryce moved off the boulder and stepped over the stream towards zel .
now let 's get going the others are leaving us behind.
rocking back then forward zel rose to his feet in one smooth motion .
it 's not that i think they 'll show up just cause you said something but thinking about it seems to make it more likely to happen.
that is n't how it works though bryce replied with a shake of his head .
bryce set off with the stream to his left heading down the gradual descent towards the other three .
vonna busy with filling her canteen besides liarie who was doing the same .
further ahead murn busied himself with clearing a path through a thick patch of undergrowth .
how much further until we are out of this place ? zel asked .
our time in this forest draws to a close very soon liarie observed with eyes pointed in the direction that murn headed .
we should be ready to deal with any conflict that arises upon our exit into the plains beyond.
now you 're saying stuff like that too. zel shifted on his feet and crossed his arms .
liarie looked to zel with a raised brow then to bryce .
he 's just superstitious is all bryce replied and leaned up against a tree to rest .
of course. liarie replied and began to screw her canteen closed before looking to zel .
so what does superstitious mean ? her ears tilted slightly towards him .
it means that head of his is filled with all kinds of crazy. vonna stood and took a drink from her canteen .
i would n't be talking after some of those comments you made in your sleep last night. zel grinned .
i said nothing ! vonna pointed a finger at zel from across the thin stream .
and i know ‘cause i could hardly sleep with you tossing and turning every damn second like a newborn child.
i fear my original question was n't entirely answered liarie cut in again .
zel ignored liarie and replied to vonna it 's hard to sleep when there are roots everywhere .
though i guess you 're used to sleeping on something hard.
vonna 's brow furrowed as her empty hand balled up into a fist .
yes i do mind. bryce sighed and straightened himself .
i do n't need you two to add physical harm to the list of issues.
i would n't want a bloody nose right now zel said .
i did not ask for any feedback zel. bryce snapped at zel before stepping past them to head towards murn who was waiting .
it was an entertaining discussion but we need to focus up once more and finish our journey .
bryce stopped and turned to face zel zel what did i just say ?
the young man caught the edge to bryce 's voice and quickly straightened himself with chin raised and shoulders back .
bryce caught liarie 's eyes as she passed a light giggle emitting from her as she found his sudden serious tone amusing .
securing the canteen on her belt vonna hopped the gap that the stream created and fell in step with bryce .
i was wondering are all company leads relaxed like you ?
bryce slowed his pace as he gave it thought his mind racing over every man and woman he 'd met who lead a company .
the numerous faces of all of them giving him both warmth at the relationship he held with them or a seething rage with ever having to deal with them .
i would n't say i 'm the only one but i am more relaxed yes.
that 's a personal question do n't you think ?
sorry. vonna trailed off unsure of how to continue .
he passed by the various kinds of spiky and thick leafed plants trampled by murn several branches already starting to poke back up in defiance .
i suppose i 'm more relaxed and calmer after all there is no reason to be angry in times of peace .
however i still expect discipline when we actually get into a combat situation.
the pair walked in silence for a few minutes trailing behind the other three who led the way down the hill towards another stream that divided the path before heading up another gentle slope .
since we began this expedition i had no idea how much you and zel argued was it like this before ?
as you both joined the company at the same time.
bryce glanced back at her to see she was looking at zel up ahead .
i do n't want to say he 's family but he is the only other person i know from basic training.
vonna lowered her head fingers fidgeting with a button along her coat .
there were two others but they shipped out before me and before i could join their company they died.
of course. bryce turned and carried on with his pace .
he crossed the thin stream and began the gradual climb up the rising slope the trees starting to thin out around them .
the chirping of birds buzzing of insects and other various animal calls began to rise as the morning slumber wore off from the forest animals .
at the top bryce noticed liarie suddenly turn her tail flicking from side to side as her ears stood on end .
he hurried in step to reach her noticing the look of fear cross her face .
his mind hurried over the possibilities before coming to rest on a single threat .
the commodore 's airship ? he called out as he neared the top .
it is not his but the luncal ship paired with his ! liarie replied .
not the commodore 's that 's something i suppose .
let 's hurry down the other side of this hill and back into the cover of the trees !
the trees lessen at the bottom of the hill is the start of the glodan plains liarie said with a turn to stare out in the direction they were heading her keen eyes narrowed as she sought out any further details .
we could head back where there is more cover vonna suggested coming up behind bryce to join the group .
how fast is that ship coming in ? bryce asked turning back towards liarie .
the fey closed her eyes in thought as her ears twitched a couple of times .
they probably have a good guess on our location we 're heading for the plains ! bryce ordered .
he set forth in a sprint down the hill not checking to see if the others were following .
sprinting down a hill with all these damn roots ! zel exclaimed .
keep an eye on your step ! liarie called out .
i face the same difficulties ! liarie replied and quickly came racing to bryce 's side .
it 's coming in fast i fear we wo n't make it without some danger from its weapons.
as if on que a roar of an engine in the distance reached bryce .
we do n't have much of a choice bryce grunted as he leapt over a large grouping of roots .
he landed squarely on his feet with a huff the pack on his back jostling violently from the maneuver .
make sure murn makes it he 'll be the slowest in this situation.
of course i 'll see you at the bottom safe and sound liarie replied and left bryce 's side .
the roaring engine grew ever louder before reaching an abrupt crescendo as the airship passed overhead sending the canopy to jostle and shift in every direction from the intense winds .
he took a deep breath and pushed onward his muscles straining between the quick pace and having to carry his heavy pack .
the engine began to lower in tone as the airship shifted positions .
between the canopy bryce noticed it turning back towards them and a plume of smoke billowing out for its side .
a salvo of gunfire and heavy shells tore through the canopy towards the forest floor below .
trees cracked and began a slow tilted tumble branches shattering as leaves flutter in every direction .
the undergrowth below were ripped to shreds with rocks and fallen branches acting as shrapnel .
sparks from the explosives caught onto the dry dead leaves along the floor creating fires that threatened to grow larger .
the pockets of snow along the path melted under the heavy heat of the firepower and the water added to the muddy terrain of the descending hill .
skidding through a patch of mud bryce bumped into the side of a fallen tree .
he used it for support as he watched the airship overhead continue past them .
the ship 's engines roared as a powerful gust of wind followed in the wake of the ship causing an upheaval throughout the canopy .
an assortment of animals scurried in every direction to escape the noise and fire .
ca n't we do something when they come for another pass ? vonna asked coming to a halt besides bryce .
if we had bigger guns then sure he replied .
turning bryce spotted zel coming up to join them with murn further back and liarie by his side .
let 's keep moving we ca n't slow down now ! he called and climbed over the tree to land in more mud on the other side his boots giving him the necessary stability to stay upright .
the pack he carried helped further with his balance as the descent of the hill threatened to take him in a neverending tumble down .
roots shrubbery and tendrils seemed to all grab at his boots in an attempt to trip him as he passed .
a loud howl of gears and shifting plates filled the air along with the disjointed kick of an engine pumping out a fresh torrent of power .
he looked to the sound and caught a glimpse of the airship turning on its bow before straightening out to head for them once more .
smoke billowed out from its sides as flashes of fire danced across the front .
he reached a hand out and slowed in his descent slightly .
bryce 's focus turned to the shells landing all around searching for any that would come too close .
with a wave of his hand a shell that had broken through the canopy suddenly twisted at an odd angle to crash off to the side with no harm .
the force of wind from the passing airship caused his coat to billow all around bryce .
loosening his grip on the magic he turned and saw murn and liarie coming up to him .
i can see vonna and zel nearly upon it !
turning bryce spotted the other two having already gone ahead starting to reach more level terrain .
hopefully the rest of our companions are still waiting for us. bryce continued down the rough terrain skidding through mud and bounding over fallen trees .
sparks of flame danced all around chasing animals from their homes .
the howl of metal and gears sounded once more as the airship began another turn .
trees became more scattered as bryce reached the evened terrain .
several streams snaked their way from the melting snow along the hill to end in growing puddles and muddy pits in the dull grass .
he ran straight through the mess of holes and dips toward vonna and zel who had slowed down .
it 's here for another pass lead ! vonna called out .
crouching down zel aimed his rifle at the oncoming airship soaring down the hill towards them and pulled the trigger .
come on ! he released the empty casing and slammed the bolt back to fire another shot .
you are n't going to hit it you idiot !
i know but i rather go out fighting then die like a coward ! zel yelled back and fired a third shot .
bryce reached them and twisted on his heel to face the airship .
the ship 's bow turned up as it leveled out its descent and smoke and fire appeared along its surface .
he extended his hands and reached out for the closest shells .
warmth filled his veins as he brushed the oncoming fire to the side guiding them with their momentum to a safe distance away .
he watched the airship fly overhead more gears shifting as it began to slow .
his eyes darted about for more cover the fewer trees at the base of the hill providing little in protection .
i ca n't keep stopping these barrages a shell is going to get through .
that last barrage tore down what few trees were left we got no cover !
an abrupt release of built up pressure in the distance shook the ground at their feet .
bryce felt relief wash through him as his tension released .
ho zel 's eyes widened with surprise before turning to glee .
rising up from behind a slope in the land were a pair of glistening white and blue projectiles with a trail of smoke following them .
the airship began to twist more flares shooting off from its stern with a low bass of popping canisters .
the engine roared to new heights of power causing those on the ground to feel their bodies shake with the vibrations .
the first projectile entered the plumes of flares continuing onward before corkscrewing to the side and exploding where the airship had been before .
the wave of energy blew the fluttering white flares in every direction .
the second projectile pierced through the smoke of the first to chase down the airship making contact on the rear .
the roaring engine abruptly halted with a screech as the left wing began to bend unnaturally .
the airship twisted at the whim of its damaged wing toward the sloped hill where the projectiles had originated .
the helium balloon built within the body of the airship began to expand in a weak attempt to gain altitude .
several cannons fired off another barrage towards the hill in defiance .
another pair of projectiles launched from the hill heading for the limping airship .
tracer fire lit up the air between the ship and the projectiles .
the projectiles drew closer to the airship with each passing second .
their bodies became littered with bullet holes before exploding just meters from the airship .
the shockwave tore the left wing off the rest of the way as holes appeared all along the balloon from shrapnel .
the airship limped along a bit further maintaining its height before it began a slow inevitable descent with the helium escaping the balloon and fires catching onto more spinning rotors .
well. zel straightened himself and looked over to bryce .
bryce adjusted his coat and pulled the tail of hair back beneath the collar .
we should n't waste time standing around ! liarie snapped coming up to join them by the tree murn bringing up the rear to stand patiently .
that luncal ship will surely have survivors and maybe even a soul !
another snap echoed across the land as a chunk of the slow crashing ship broke off to plummet down into the ground below .
is it possible that a soul strong enough to power a ship just landed in my lap ?
with a deep breath bryce began to march through the mud and grass heading for the drier fields waiting just beyond .
patches of fire where pieces of the ship had already crashed helping to light up the path that he had to head towards .
our companions will surely be there let 's make sure we do n't keep them waiting.
vonna placed a hand on zel 's shoulder yes more running .
zel caught the faceless stare of murn before he passed by in pursuit of bryce .
bryce left the muddy terrain behind and entered a rhythmic pace through the field of grass .
he maintained his breathing even as he drew closer to the wreckage any fear of danger kept at the back of his mind .
instead he focused on the reunion with the rest of his company .
nearing the crashed ship the smell of smoke grew thicker as the heat of nearby fires brought brief warmth to his chilled skin .
the cool air had little effect in fighting back the heat .
slowing his pace bryce unholstered his dual shot pistol and brought a steady warmth to his free left hand .
he scanned the wreckage that was starting to surround him with each passing step .
twisted beams bent metal platforms splintering wood crates with contents spilled out unmoving bodies .
everything was scattered with no rhyme or reason fires eager to cover it all .
a gunshot caught his attention the sound coming from deeper within the wreckage .
spotting a large enough gap between two metal sheets he made his way through .
taking each turn with caution his pistol always raised and at the ready .
the thick-mustached man had a rifle in hand aimed at a feathered-cap soldier who was begging with soundless words .
with a pull of the trigger the soldier collapsed .
the bolt pulled back the man reloaded the rifle .
with a click he looked up with a knowing nod to bryce lead it 's great to see you 're back .
i 've sent him with the other three around the perimeter to make sure no luncal escape .
dunkir wiped at his large nose before turning around .
they 're back this way trying to find the soul. he led bryce through more gaps in the mess of wreckage .
the short broad-shouldered dunkir seemingly having no issues in climbing over obstacles and squeezing between tighter spaces .
his rifle kept in his thick-gloved hands finger resting along the trigger guard ready .
armor plates were sewn into his uniform only furthering his bulky appearance .
up ahead the fires began to lessen green sparks of light drifted in the air coming and going at random .
i found their chief ! a voice rung out along the walls .
rounding the corner bryce saw three more figures searching about a large clearing .
the one that was closes looked up at dunkir and bryce her eyes lighting up with excitement .
lead ! she dropped a piece of wreckage she had been investigating to salute with fist over her heart and her head raised .
it 's great to see you once more ! her helmet shifting slightly to reveal the sandy-blonde hair beneath .
at ease herra. bryce replied meeting her light-brown glistening eyes .
yes ! she beamed a smile and quickly bent down to the wooden chunk she had been moving before .
bryce grimaced in disappointment at the luncal officer with a thick piece of metal through his heart .
the luncal 's darker ridged skin covered in blood .
unfortunately he 's dead as you can see herra shook her head slowly .
but not all is lost after all the aura is still up. she reached out to one of the green sparks floating in the air .
the light dissipated at the touch of her fingers .
for once the fortune of yen shines upon us .
best we hurry before the soul departs. bryce replied before moving past her towards the other two figures near the center of the clearing .
the pale boys huddled over a twisted and mangled ship console both stood in unison to give a salute to the approaching lead .
darke riel can you salvage the soul ? bryce asked studying the twins .
between their grey eyes and pale skin they gave off an ethereal presence that no normal born human could have .
both of them wore a violet uniform with a white band running down from one shoulder .
darke had it on his left and riel on his right shoulder .
darke 's hair was left unkempt and spiky while riel had his hair combed with a band braided behind his right ear .
sort of ? riel asked with a tilt of his head .
quit asking such pointless questions ghosts dunkir grumbled and crossed his arms .
both boys glared at dunkir in unison before turning back to one another .
best to ignore the short tempered one darke whispered .
agreed it is a waste of time riel replied .
dunkir took a step forward what was that ? he hissed .
enough ! bryce cut in and gave both sides a glare .
dunkir go with herra and make sure there are n't any more luncal stragglers lying about.
he muttered a curse to herra along the way the girl nodding enthusiastically as she rushed ahead .
both of them heading off past a large piece of sheet metal stabbed into the ground .
now then. bryce turned his attention back to the pair .
riel reached a thin fingered hand to place it at the center of the banged-up console .
showed this to my bf and she 's his fav anime girl and hates vegeta so perfect fit .
i never did a prober anime fig just two silent hill scales and some pokemon shiny recolors for brush training .

i live in the seattle area and was wondering why almost all gas pumps have this special nozzle https i.imgur.com/8vntecp.jpg ours are a bit bigger that compresses and locks the gas pump onto my car .
my car 2016 honda civic has a capless fuel filler system .
i can get the gas nozzle on but i have to struggle quite a bit to get it off my car .
what is this for and what 's the proper way to take it off ?
why is n't there more outage about the contracts in myteam .
there literally the most useless items in a video game and no reason to exist at all .
having to waste your earn mt or even vc sometime so players can actually play games is ridiculous .
i am buying assetto corsa and i wasnt sure if i should buy the ultimate edition or the basic 20 dollar version .
tldr what do i need to buy and how do i configure it in order to stream local content to multiple devices without internet log ins or paid software ?
as far as i can tell plex requires people to have accounts to log in to a plex server but i wo n't have internet access to facilitate this and want devices that do n't already have the app or software to be able to log in .
laptops i could keep a copy of whatever software works and provide that as needed .
i 've tried getting it running with kodi upnp and smb sharing but perhaps because i 'm trying to test if it can work on a public network that 's my problem .
what is the cheapest but best router to create a network over which i can stream content to laptops and tablets without an internet connection available for verifying accounts ?
is it easiest to run this no internet server from an android tv box mini pc or rasoberry pi ?
is universal media server plex free or kodi my best option ?
i 'd love to do more than just make the files accessible over a network if it 's possible for people to install kodi or whatever from an installer without access to the internet and be able to view all the posters and metadata i 'll make sure to collect it all and export it to the individual folders before leaving home
emby as server on anything that will run it connected to local wifi through basically any router as i 'm not planning many simultaneous streams or anything above 1080p and kodi with embycon addon as the client side viewer .
i 've not tested multiple devices logged in simultaneously yet and although it works offline internet is still required during the embycon install even if you download the embycon zip and the kodi .apk
on sunday i had sex for the first time i 've been on nexplanon since december and things have been fine .
i get my period every 3 months and it last anywhere from 3 weeks to a month .
i had sex on my period and we did not use a condom .
i 'm scared half to death that i 'll get pregnant .
my mother died the day before my 18th birthday ... .that was so long ago .
this year i brought my birthday in alone working from home during a pandemic .
i did n't drink yesterday i kept it moving .
today i craved alcohol like you would n't believe ... i could taste that sting of scotch rolling down my throat ... but then i thought of how that double shot would likely end with a whole bottle being devoured ... .and me blacking out after cursing out the entire bar ... ..yeah ... .no thanks !
anyway ... .just dropping in to say i am still working it out and thankful to not taking a drink today .
hope all is well with you all ... . blessings .
you used to be so ashamed of your massive tits .
that 's all anyone saw when they looked at you when you were growing up .
girls would torment and be cruel boys would tease you and your dad 's friends would say the most horrible fucked-up things about you in passing .
when you went to college you thought you 'd reinvent yourself .
you 'd be the quirky feminist indie girl all the smart cool guys wanted .
you 'd get bangs and black hornrim glasses and invest in a record player .
too bad your vintage band shirts and thrift store cardigans could n't hide your fat ridiculous rack .
no one ever cared about your records or your books or your perfect politics .
all guys wanted at the end of the night was to plaster your silly oversized milk jugs .
even the ones that pretended to like you still traded humiliating pics of you with their friends .
you 'd see texts about you pop up on their phone are u still with the titcow ? you 're not actually dating that freakshow are you ? u only use her for those boobs right ?
you started wondering if they were right all along .
smart girls did n't have fat stupid tits like you did they ?
you wanted to fit in with the other hipster girls but no one took you seriously .
you 'd tell them about how you 've dealt with misogyny all your life .
they 'd just roll their eyes and pretend you did n't exist .
you 'd wonder if they saw those embarrassing pics you sent to your dates .
pics where you 're choking yourself with a belt pics where hurt me please daddy is scrawled across your massive rack in marker or pics where you 're pouting in some ridiculous slutty outfit .
maybe they do n't take you seriously because you 've went home with professors .
or they know you tried to call rape on the boy you liked because he did n't call you back .
or how you cry at parties when you drink to much .
but more than likely they just do n't take you seriously because of those dumb fat tits .
tits that you ca n't hide under your clothing no matter what you wear .
it 'll never change the fact your tits are your personality .
you 're doomed to be a sad eyed big titty novelty and you know it .
you tell guys you love them on the 2nd date or the 1st one if you 're drunk enough .
you turn around and see me make eyes at you .
i 'm exactly your type but i 'm with someone .
the type of girl that always tormented you and made you feel worthless .
you wonder how absolutely devastatingly it would be if you stole me from her .
how she 'd cry and seethe about losing to a girl like you .
some silly busty girl that she always mocked and ridiculed .
i 'm looking for a rp partner that has a kink for misogyny and extreme dirty talk .
bonus if you have a grasp on dark humor .
excited to hear how you 'd wreck my gf 's ego .
the girl in the prompt is inspired by busty glamour models like rachel aldana leanne crow tessa fowler etc .
over the last 3 weeks i have more seriously been streaming vr daily and having a blast with it !
i am just reaching out to see if anyone in this reddit community would be interested in joining my discord server playing some vr games together and maybe watching my stream of many vr games !
join the discord to hang out and chat with some fellow vr and game enthusiasts !
i also have a youtube twitch instagram and tiktok full of vr gameplay highlights !
but just curious ... how many were you getting ?
i 've been counting her as townie numbers this whole time .
if she does n't we 're at 4-3 and killing ariel this phase will work just fine .

apparently n-acetyl l-tyrosine might be the safest and effective way to raise dopamine .
great now if you 'll excuse me i 'm going to listen to sad aerosmith songs to hurt myself even further .
the most amusing part about this anti-government post is that the fucking president retweeted it
i could but the cerb pays 2000/month and if i 'm eligible for it per the cra i would prefer to take that over the cesb of 1250/month
what 's more important is who 's the lead director and animator .

i understand that completely because my parents both suffered forms of child abuse and when we lived with my grandmother i was abused for a while .
i hid from her avoided her at all costs did everything perfectly just for it to be nitpicked etc .
however i think that in an alternative form it could be effective l. take away anything that they use that teaches them to misbehave .
until they learn how to use these items and understand inappropriate behavior .
yeah dude i was on duolingo for a couple months wondering why tf it was n't even teaching me numbers yet .
the point is n't to make sense it 's to overload the system with as much bullshit as possible to buy every last second of time .
if you 're in a hole and the cops are at the top of the hole every foot you dig down delays getting caught by a little while .
that was a good one because i called you a 12 year old and then you made the same joke and changed it to 14 .
i do like reading my own jokes again even if it 's out of some cunt 's little cock holster .

the guy i bought them from was moving to london and did n't want to bring any of his stuff overseas so he was liquidating everything he owned .
i was outcast but i had my own group of friends that accepted me .
everyone else i considered to be a problem and either avoided or was hostile to them .
i thought other kids were immature annoying rude or hostile .
it wasnt until later in high school where like you said people started to mature and pair up when i noticed i did not belong and that i was the one who was immature and emotionally stunted .
i was heavily disassociated and angry as a child and i did n't even know .
watching girls and women respond to me one way and my friends another way was one thing because in my mind i was still the hero dealing with adversity and i would prevail .
when a girl actually liked me despite seeing me all my walls came crashing down and i realized i was a terrified little kid who felt worthless unloved weak angry and resentful and petty .
i realized it was me who was the problem not everyone else .
more than a decade later i 'm still very slowly inching towards emotional development .
i still regress quite a bit but thanks to a bunch of inner critic work i 've got a handle on how i react to that .
closeness and intimacy and connection still feels impossible though and it does make me feel hopeless sometimes .

it is supremely frightening that almost 30 of votes for this image are down votes .
politics aside the image is an accurate depiction of someone who suffers from morbid obesity .
i estimate a waist size of 44-46 inches with a bmi of approximately 40 or higher which is the highest level of obesity as defined by the cdc .
ironically trump 's current weight has been reported as 193 lb recently .
the man in this image weights quite a bit more than 200 lbs .
given his claimed height of 6'3 '' his weight may be more in the 280 range .
i would be a pelican because they are the best thing ever .
too many parentheses tafsirs in the middle of translation oft repeated words which break the flow of reading because they explain the verse with context in the translation .

no tafsirs in the middle to explain the context .
there 's a difference between a game where everybody is op in their own way and you ai n't even mad because the game seems fair after all .
one where most are op but other are obnoxiously broken and unfair that you rely entirely on the enemy to make huge mistakes in order to not be perma grey screen .
this worsens with yuumi who transforms any mistake you make no matter how big it is into no mistake at all .
but i do know the difference between there their and they 're !

we exaggerate benefits we neglect flaws and so on .
exactly my point here.. though the books might have been loosely based on actual events '' to give the reader a submerged experience the fantasy and magical elements are added and more over to preach morality a common human would n't listen to me or you .
but what if the same comes from an almighty who is said to be more powerful than any of us ?
the we humans would be afraid of such power right ?

but the truth is as the time went by and the beliefs took a strong root the so said upper class took advantage of it and kept the common masses at bay neglecting them all sorts of benefits .
even today in this modern india there are places that follow this upper and lower caste systems vigorously .
but make no mistake we are coming out of it .
the new generation are far more thoughtful and rational than the previous ones .
right coming back to the topic without the almighty power all the epics and puranas are just stories that we tell children .
so i believe there is no such god and that we humans have created a character like that to make ourselves get rid of fear our problems etc ...
see at a time of crisis if we feel that we are alone we might be feeling low .
but if we feel like there is god and that he will take care of our problems we 'd feel a little light .
my question here is you believe what you believe .
can you deny that the religious wars and riots that happened in our country for the past two three decades arent based on this ?
that some lame politicians made the innocent massed to fight on their behalf so that they would enjoy the fruits ?
tell me if their god is real why would he let the innocents fight his war ?
just like this happens in mahabharata ... or got .
even though krishna is a god and he can take out the entire enemy army with one blow of his why didnt he do it ?
why let thousands on innocents die on both the sides ?
btw can anyone explain why did dharmraj bet draupadi ?
you know dharmaraj had lost himself before betting and loosing draupadi .
when she hears it she asks if dharmaraj himself belongs to dhuriodhana then how can he bet me ?
do you know what bhismar replied to her question ?
he says that all wifes belong to their husband '' so she dont hav the right to ask about it ...
now tell me if this is what mahabharatha preaches ...
if this female slavery is good for our culture.. our traditions in our country for soo long years were based on these preachings until some heroes rose against it and abolished such practices..
i 'll ask you a question from sirpi rajan an aethist..
when dhuriodhana removes the saree of draupathi in front of all his assembly men she calls for lord krishna s help .
dont he know everything and he could hav stopped this adharma right ?
he supplied infinite rolls of saree to draupathi as dhuriodhana pulls it off.. insetead of supplying endless material of saree he could hav fought with dhuriodhana and stopped it once and for all right ?
jus wanted to give you a detailed reply so i took my time ... .
i know this debate wont change anything.. but jus wanted to express my thoughts ... not to hurt anyone s feelings .
btw nice name ... my fav is kakashi hatake ...

long story short the same reasons people use pcs instead of consoles except applied to software .
i could go through most of this subreddit 's wiki page just changing console for windows pc for linux and hardware for software but the tl dr will be linux is more customizable it 's an open platform and a better overall system the only reason windows still has a hold on the market is because it 's almost a monopoly so people and companies have to bend over to support it because otherwise they lose 95 of market share but you can see windows constantly failing in every market where they do n't hold a monopoly cellphones embedded devices servers super computers etc

does the fact i 'm on mobile have anything to do with it ?
in my personal opinion you do you and take whatever is necessary to help you quit .
a lot of people do n't realize this but adderall is amazing for rls .
i tried all of the natural '' supplements during many of my 100 attempts to quit and heavy 2 year sodium habit and they did n't work at all for me .
it was n't until i switched to sulfate and tapered with the help of gaba and tramadol .
i had about a 2 week supply of etiz that helped me with any anxiety and sleep issues .
honestly by the time i finally was able to quit you could have told me to lick a frog 's ass and i would have done it .
have w/d from many opiates and tia w/ds are like no other .
there is nothing wrong with using helper meds to quit just do n't stay on them any longer than necessary but long enough to get you out of the hell of tia .

anyone on the ftse100 it 's a rather different case though it 's less likely to be new shares and new money coming into the company .
they 've just bought in on the expectation of leeching out dividends and will throw their dollies out of prams when companies decide not do do it e.g .
recent bt decision to bin the dividend and use the cash for actual productive investment in their networks which led to the share price sinking a bit more
there 's nothing useful or productive when it comes to shareholders buying and selling from each other nor is there much to say about the idea of perennial dividends or share price increases that only benefit those who did n't actually do anything to deserve it

got my order handed to me once from a boy that looked all of 7 with who i 'm assuming was mom in the car .
this was just before things started getting locked down hard and i wondered if the adult did n't really have anyone/anywhere else for kiddo but i did n't quite like it either .
i do the same thing except i dont use tfsa .
i keep it open just so i can accumulate the limit increase incase i loose my mind and store it there one day .
i dont like how you cant day trade with it and the fact that the cra and gov are snooping it all the time because its linked to ur sin number this makes me feel like my money is their insurance .
another thing that drives me mental is people borrow money on their cards etc .
and pay intrest up to 20 percent meanwhile they have money on their tfsa collecting like 1 percent .
so the bank is literally lending them their own money for a profit of 19 percent .
yeah sure just give credit and i 'm fine with that .
how to enlarge your pennies with your hands in 2 weeks
if you are thinking about the possibilites of having a large penis then the answer is yes .
it is possible and also within a very short time .
but for this you have to follow some excersises and do them the proper way .
men think that penis exercise is like a muscle exercise .
try to flex it so it goes from ultra-soft to ultra-hard in a split second .
exercises are n't the answer to getting a bigger penis because the penis is n't a muscle that you can mound .
many times men actually do damage to their penis by forcing blood inside .
their penises end up bent or even broken in the worst cases .
there 's a smart way to increase your penis size ... we 'll cover that in a minute .
since you are doing these routines while taking a nice hot shower warming your penis is already done ... with the hot shower !
just let the water hit your manhood for about 2 minutes .
even though warming up is very quick and easy do not i repeat do not underestimate the importance of warming your penis up prior to doing natural male enhancement .
retract your foreskin and grasp your phallus behind its head/glans firmly .
pull it outwards with enough force to feel painless stretch inside your shaft .
repeat steps 2 to 4 but this time pull it upwards to your belly button .
repeat but this time pull it downwards to your knees .
repeat but this time pull it to your left side .
take your time to go through a cool down phase .
i highly recommend you to promote your growth and results with proper supplements .
it 's common knowledge that kegel exercises are beneficial to women 's health in a variety of ways .
however very few men know that you can significantly improve the blood flow and quality of your erections .
your dick will look larger just by maintaining more control over the erection itself !
this involves just massaging or lightly masturbating in order to achieve temporary natural looking size .
obviously this one is going to take a trial period to find out what works best .
too much massaging can lead to an erection and that 's not the kind of natural size we are after porn how to enlarge your pen.is in 2 weeks by hand sex education nudenakedie pornie https youtu.be/hlwqnq65ge4 .
give it a week or so to find out just how much or how little is required to achieve a naturally looking larger penis .
i fully agree that it 's a reasonable trick to fall for .
i guess my point is that craig is potentially occupying the weird space of understanding just enough to perform the trick but not enough to see the trick as too transparent .
perhaps it takes a supersized portion of self admiration to believe that you 're so much smarter than everyone else ...
though for whatever its worth lots of people who initially knew little about pgp also immediately figured wright out with a little bit of research as soon as they heard the impossible claim .
i think if you rank the success of his various stunts the pgp stuff would n't rank pretty highly .
the highest ones are the social engineering ones where he gets some apparent authority to endorse him .
a good principle is that when you see an advert and it just falls flat for you you should assume you 're not the target more quicker than you assume it 's not effective .
or when some institution does n't seem to be serving its mission but still persists perhaps you 've misunderstood what its real mission actually is which may have little to do with the stated mission .
it might be that wright is sucking lately but i think we should give equal weight to the theory that we 're just not seeing things from the target 's perspective .

roommate found me naked on the floor struggling to breathe .

nebuliser helped me breathe but little did i know the worst was yet to come .
paramedics said i had a fever and transported me to hospital .
got placed in quarantine by nurses dressed up for chernobyl .
got treated for my fever and tested for the virus .
speaking of the test never again do i want those long ass swabs shoved down my throat again it was so damn deep it practically touched my brain .
i winced when said doctor pressed on my stomach .
doctor narrowed her eyes and asked what the colour of my poop was .
i said kinda dark but you know not outer space dark '' .
doctor said hm '' before proceeding to spread my ass cheeks and jam her lubricated finger into my anus .
for the record that finger was thick as fuck and it happened to be the first time ever something penetrated me down there .
got discharged with a laundry list of prescribed medications and advised to self isolate until i recieve my test results .

we 've simplified our set to only the car key and house key making it less stuff to sanitize .

i 've never met a trump supporter who could justify their support of trump without it devolving into vitriol or bigotry on their part .
as soon as you contradict the trumpian narrative you become their enemy .
it 's hard to believe that in 2020 there are still people pissing in the wind this naively .
of course given your history is full of effete trump apologetics it 's looking pretty obvious that you 're a trump supporter and thus a terrible person .

i get it sometimes i get caught up too when i see cute moments between my faves .
however what i do n't like is the gross level of fetishization that i see from fans the overused stereotypes of gay men and women .
i also dislike the fans taking every moment and romanticizing it and wanting confirmation of their ships so much that they basically bring it up directly to the members where they can see .
if you want to ship them romantically then have some sense about it at least .
but many do n't and the ones that cross boundaries ruin it for the shippers that do n't .
i have a love and hate relationship with fan service .
sometimes idols do too much and it 's very obvious .
i 'm not saying there are no lgbtq idols or that all the touching we see ca n't have romantic intentions but the point is we do n't know at the end of the day and we should n't get carried away and start declaring our assumptions as facts .
what will we do when the dust settles and we are forced to chose ?

jacob gladly let barry take the lead as they enter into the chamber .
they could n't be sure what they would face and in that uncertainty they had to put their best foot forward .
estelle and him were great obviously but barry looked more intimating and was perhaps just a bit more capable at fighting than estelle .
either way he would last longer in a direct fight than jacob .
once inside the chamber jacob had to give it the once over far more than once .

for me the effects have been mostly pretty subtle so far but i do feel like there 's improvement .

on my second day i did n't have that same calming effect but i did notice myself being more productive than usual with housework and such .
but yeah there 's a part of me that 's second guessing myself and wondering if it 's placebo affect for me .

you should only invite people to your wedding who respect and support your relationship .
matt saying that he does n't believe in marriage '' and that peter is making a mistake '' should disqualify him as best man anyway because those comments separately and alone do not respect or support your relationship .
the rest is just decorative cherries on top that make me feel without reservation that he should not even be invited to the bachelor party ceremony or reception as a guest let alone invited as a planner best '' man or even a guest of honor or groomsman .
he has stated explicitly that he not only does not respect your relationship he openly intends to attempt to sabotage it .
i know it 's hard to consider but at this point if peter can not see that it is barely if at all appropriate to even remain friends with matt then i think you need to have a serious discussion about what that signals for the future .
here 's what it signals to me although peter has attempted to verbally reign in matt even after multiple '' repeated offensive diatribes he still can not bring himself to definitively prevent this horribly disrespectful and transparently shockingly embarrassing speech from publicly happening in front of all of your closest friends and family .
look even without the very last conversation matt had already cemented himself as a massive liability at the wedding .
prior to his proud announcement that he intends to try to tempt peter into disrespecting his vows and commitment to you he had still loudly proclaimed that his energy would be a negative black cloud over your wedding .
at this point even if he was just '' a groomsman that means peter is inviting a person to stand beside him at his wedding knowingly harboring ill thoughts towards your marriage .
matt has also shown that he does not respect peter 's autonomy personal choices or his wishes .
he has refused to abstain from sharing his toxic thoughts even at the repeated direct requests of his best friend .
i 'm not sure what personal crisis has sparked this psychotic divergence from normality afflicting matt but peter needs to really examine why he continues to place his trust and loyalty within someone who can not even be trusted to hold his tongue during the most important moment of his best friend 's life .
he should at minimum revoke matt 's invitation from the wedding consider ending their friendship and finally depending on how out of character this is for matt seek mental help for him .

hafta admit the daily mail does seem to get facts that nobody else gets ... and the author of this coverage is none other than ruth styles who once covered the papini case and who got into some trouble reportedly issued a warning by police for supposedly standing on sidewalks in mountain gate and peering over fences '' .

they were said to be returning from a camping trip in idaho '' .
this kinda stumps me especially that nobody has reported much on this .

i would n't say you wooshed because maybe you just have n't seen the movie ... .
i understand if you dont know how to respond but would you reccomend waiting for cyber monday/black friday to buy my parts ?
you also said that ryzen 4000 and rtx 3000 are coming out in a few months so would it be wiser to wait till christmas time to buy my parts ?
i 'm working on a simple web frontend in powershell that i need to have different authentication based on the url .
i 've had the web server itself working and have been able to set windows authentication or anonymous authentication without issue by just setting the authenticationschemes property of the httplistener however the way of allowing them to be used based on the url is to assign the authenticationschemeselectordelegate property of the httplistener object as per https docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.authenticationschemeselector ? view=netframework-4.8 https docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.authenticationschemeselector ? view=netframework-4.8
unfortunately as soon as i try this every request just responds with a 500 internal server error and i 'm not sure how i can find out much more info than that .
i 've not worked with delegates in powershell before so i 'm hoping it 's just a simple syntax issue would love any sort of help .
i see this problem a lot and i could n't solve it .
i use webman for ps1 and i ca n't change discs while playing .
because issues with internet i ca n't use webman from my phone so i 'm trying with pad commands but it does n't work .
edit when i can use the web browser i get to the option to unmount mount the game but i tested with 3 of them and when it ask for the disc it mounts but the game does n't detect the action and gets stuck on the screen .
every time something comes up we 're always jumping the gun and maybe take things too far .
the devs always take the time to be transparent and explain everything calmly .
i do n't think it 's fair to bombard them with hate while they work on ways to make us happy .
so i 've been watching this show for a few days and i 'm an episode away from finishing greed island .
i really loved the yorknew city arc and while talking to one of my friends he told me that the anime peaked at the yorknew city arc and the chimera ant arc is really overrated .
and what makes the rivalry so interesting/intense whether they in confidence out of conference or even out of country
i wanted to try and relive some nostalgia and tried to download fast and furious but it said that the game is n't available on the microsoft store .
is there a way to still get either of these games ?

striving to buy a bunker this weekend could really use help
naturally i would normally prefer to live in boston 's city center but it would be quite a commute to work 25 min .
however i am not quite ready to settle into that suburban life yet .
one thing i was thinking is living in downtown lowell which only a 15 min commute and it has a rail line directly to boston .
i have also looked into arlington and somerville which would be a good compromise but the other thing is that i highly prefer covered parking also an issue with downtown boston .
i am familiar of the struggle of scrapping snow off the car at 7am.. of course there is also the price lowell is slightly cheaper than boston .
so overall i need covered parking and i prefer somewhere that i can access downtown boston without a car or rideshare .
long have i waited to get my hands on this game and i 'm sure i 'm not the only one .
you 've probably been asked this a lot but please give me any intel .
during aew i made a comment about marko stunt .
i said he has a tough heart and is really one of my favorites in aew or wwe .
i really wanted to make a post repeating this .
maybe he will see it and cheer him up .
even when the odds are against him he does n't run away or back down .
heck he kept his eyes on archer when jungle boy was ringside .
i just know that one day with that heart of his he will win a big match .
but he 'll never be as big of a man like marko stunt is .
is it wise to wait for q2 2020 earnings before buying stocks ?
will the market take a dive or is it expected that earnings gon na be low or nonexistent ?
i realize this might be a niche opinion and my only reference for its unpopularity is the group of people i 've gone camping with .
i live in the american west among vast tracts of public lands .
i have friends who like me enjoy a wilderness camping and hiking trip .
however their way of going about planning those trips makes me want to tear my hair out .
my idea of a good time is to basically throw a dart at a map or zoom in at random on google earth and then figure out if i can get there .
i then research weather and road/trail conditions restrictions and permits none are the most preferable set a very basic timetable and make up a gear list pack it and get on my way .
i use whatever means i need to to reach that destination motor vehicle bicycle hiking boots .
i travel light and ensure that i have sufficient food and water one set of appropriate clothing with changes of socks and underwear basic wilderness tools and if in a forested area a hammock that i can hang between trees and some ponchos to string over it to keep any rain off .
if the area is n't forested i take a goretex cover for my sleeping bag and sleep on the ground .
i camp wherever seems safe and dry and i eat canned protein and crackers mostly along with apples and granola bars and pack all my trash out .
i stop in ranger stations or local stores on the way and talk to the people there .
in the end if conditions change or my goal is unattainable i simply make new plans on the spot .
my friends on the other hand insist on locating an approved pay campground making reservations checking reviews of the local trails and attractions looking for towns in the vicinity where they might stop in for a restaurant meal and shopping for any additional items packing overpriced dehydrated food packets and premade trail mix along with camp stoves and folding chairs that weigh them down .
i 've had a lot of success just rambling around like i have and the next season i have brought these friends to some of the better sites i 've found .
i 've found an absolutely stunning beach that i 've never seen more than a handful of people at in the middle of summer i 've discovered incredible views from buttes and mountains no one seems to have ever heard of .
my friends have enjoyed these places but are incapable of finding them on their own it seems and unwilling to go along with me on these voyages of discovery which makes me sad .
i 've gone on trips that they 've planned as well and while some of the attractions have been worth it there 's nothing more thrilling to me than coming upon a beautiful place with no one around completely unanticipated .
and if i do n't find something that strikes that chord in me i keep moving until i do .
there is a to-do list type app that uses percentages to show how far along you are that i can not remember the name of .
i saw it as one of some recommended apps on the google play store but i can not seem to find it and regret not downloading it when i first saw it .
seeing high impact pulse rifles get buffer to be more forgiving while 150 and 180 scouts remain untouched hurt much soul ...
this game desperately needs a better penalty system in place if it 's going to gain as much professional traction as expected .
last night i was in a match with the raze on my team trolling the whole time throwing rounds and using ults/nades to damage teammates talking shit in chat and just overall ruining the match for everyone on the team .
we wo n't be able to rank up with people like that on the team so add a vote kick feature pls
i may have missed some things so if you have other things than what 's on this list feel free to make an offer !
i love sunbasket but the portions are just too small .

i loved the dynamics of having large sprawling empires .

hello everyone this is my first post here so please be gentle with me !
also my comp crashed while i was writing this the first time
lv 88 5 valiant crown mub 60/+100 ran out of consecrated water
6 staff 1ub 10 hp to help get into eciella pubs lol
lv 100 5 a wish upon the yuletree mub 100/+0
so i started out like many here by trying a water team and failing hard then switching to and filtering for shadow .
but my 4th shadow would have been delphi and i did n't have enough toilet paper saved to mana spiral another character nor the dark t4 orbs .
i was losing random ai members even on full water so i tried adding grace .
i needed both patia and grace to survive with grace running chocolatiers to avoid screwups in the first 15 seconds .
so it was going to be my core of galex patia and grace and a random water character .
reasoning was pipple synergises with the extremely powerful doublebuff strategy adds the skill damage co-ab and also the ai literally can play just as well as a human lol .
my pubs started getting the boss down to about 20-35 boss health before timing out which was n't quite enough .
biggest problem i identified was that pipple was using a crappy wind chimeratech wand 0ub so basically a pea shooter .
but that 's a huge investment of resources so i did n't want to screw up .
and since i 'm new i did n't have any hdt weapons to my name .
thanks so much for those who answered by the way !
so apparently all but one agreed that hdt weapons are bad on pipple since they reset the energised state that pipple relies on .
leftover choices were elisanne valerio and tiki with the non-pipple consensus being on valerio .
tons of ashes later i had a new weapon !
how else was i going to get into ehmc/mhmc pubs ?
many thanks to all the groups who were willing to give my low might grace a shot !
tons more ashes later i had enough materials to make a hdt1 2ub .
at that point i decided that the pain of using 2 damascus ingots to get the hdt1 to mub was worth the real time saved .
so 2 ingots to get the hdt1 to mub enhance to hdt2 then 4 more ingots to mub it .
my raid might immediately jumped from around 42k to 48k .
i also spammed a ton of arrow stickers during those fights .
i must say the number of shadow teams especially galex leads with poison prints was infuriating .
do these people not look into things even a little bit before playing difficult content ?
do they just fail to notice all their umbral erasues/corrosive cages not dealing poison ?
fortunately though they tended to die at the first purple tail sweep/volcano and then give up and leave .
it took a while but eventually i found a team that i knew could do it .
well i did n't know know but i had a good feeling .
the first time iirc someone died to stupid stuff but i 'm always willing to give people another chance i 'm new so i really appreciate it when people give me another shot you know ?
second time we got it down to about 25 health on par with before i fixed up my team .
but more importantly than that i could feel us all improving and learning how to work with each other .
third try we got it down to a sliver of health !
a few more games and we finally got that sweet sweet victory .
i can understand epimetheus since some people only have that as their 4th invested dark dragon or whatever .
but plaguebringer fires of hate ... you might as well leave that slot empty if you 're bringing it .
doing this protects not only you but your entire ai-controlled team .
do this even if you yourself wo n't be hit by the attack .
if you can form a team with gleo and without galex do so and control gleo .
pretend you 're melee as gleo and stand in the same spot as the melees focusing the tail mhjp/eciella-style .
that way when you drop your buff zone you 're buffing not only yourself but all the melees there .
if you 're a melee watch for the zones mentioned above and attack from these zones at all times when possible .
if you 're galex hopefully you 've learned how to 4c fs as your attack combo .
regardless keep in mind that because of the skill haste your best rotation is actually 4c s1 4c+fs/5c s1 .
that said gleo buff zones do n't last long not just because of buff time but also because boss moves a lot .
i would advocate 4c s1 repeatededly while in a buff zone to milk it while it lasts .
it 's not the most important thing for the first 10 seconds of the fight .
better to charge up your skills because the boss will do a red charge attack at the left and you need a skill up to i-frame it so your ai teammates wo n't die .
boss will wind up for a roar which knocks your team up into the air for 2 seconds killing your dps .
if you 're activating it you wo n't get pushed up .
if it 's 15 or less by this point your dps is in a good spot .
after the boss summons the volcanoes it will do a triple breath attack followed by the dreaded purple tail spin that wipes entire parties .
a lot of people have found a strategy for this that works for them .
while tail is alive focus farthest away volcano to reduce the chance of a screwup with the purple tail spin killing ai/pubmates
after tail is gone focus closest volcano to increase the chance of hitting both the volcano and the boss at the same time
whatever you do if someone calls out a volcano with the direction stickers do not fight them without a very good reason .
and no i 've always done the bottom one so i 'm gon na keep doing that one '' is not a good reason .
and yes i did wipe once to someone doing that .
i roll into the edge of the arena non-stop until the volcanoes go off just to be absolutely certain that the ai teammates wo n't run off and get killed .
even in the winning run we lost 1 of our 16 this way .
you should have the tail cut off very quickly after this .
watch the overdrive gauge carefully as i 've noticed break status is a lot shorter here than normal .
when the gauge gets low start saving up your skills as you wo n't have time to build them up once break happens .
now that the tail is gone focus the main body .
watch out in case your focus switches to a leg and make sure to switch it back to the body when that happens .
the boss might summon volcanoes at around 20-30 seconds before the end .
you have about 3 or so seconds after the timer runs out to deal the last bit of damage .
do n't stop when the timer hits 0 if the boss is almost down .
lastly i thanked a bunch of people throughout the post but i want to put them all in one spot
a word of thanks to the teammates that i fought with .
i 'm so sorry i forgot to take a screencap with your names !
but i sent friend requests to all of you .
thanks to all the people who responded to my post in the megathread !
i could n't have done this without your advice .
thanks to all those who tolerated my low might as grace in eciella and hawk in ehmc/mhmc .
thanks to all those who stuck with my pubs and tried more than once .
finding people probably takes longer than the fights themselves so i always appreciate being given another shot !
much success for all of you trying to get this done in the last hour !
i 'm new to arduino and i 'm more of a software code guy so my knowledge in the hardware is pretty bad so i 'm sorry if i ever ask stupid questions .
i 'm using a powerbank for my arduino uno r3 using the usb cable and it 's working pretty neat albeit the shutdowns which i believe is because it 's not drawing enough current for the bank to stay on .
what i 'm troubled in is the l9110 motor driver module not working at all when i plug it in to the usb port i only used the red and black wires on the usb wires to connect it to gnd and vcc .
i found ways on the internet to turn on the powerbank but it seems pretty unclear to me .
my main problem is i want to power both the arduino and the l9110 motor driver module on my powerbank .
i looked it up and it says i need to put a resistor in it but i 'm not an expert in ohm 's law .
the l9110 driver says it can draw up to 800ma of current with 2.5v to 12v range of voltage .
questions a should i build my l9110 driver with the motors so it can draw current now on the powerbank ?
or will it not work because it just is n't working ?
questions b which resistor should i use and what maths am i going to use to solve in order to power on the powerbank ?
i 'm so sorry for being too stupid on this topic but i 'm really interested in both software and hardware because of arduino .

as a multiracial/cultural person i love watching idols speaking in multiple languages .
i 'm curious as to what you guys think is the most multilingual '' idol considering not only how many languages but how well they speak them .
my personal opinion is jackson wang is currently the most multilingual .
9/10 for english 9/10 cantonese 8/10 for korean 7/10 for mandarin .
based on very limited information his shanghainese is 7/10 japanese is 3/10 .
most idols can somewhat speak a tiny bit of english so let 's not include that .
for instance taeyong 's english is not bad and can even translate the word fox '' instinctively but i would n't consider him as being able to speak english .

she 's eyeing a really cute top that will sit just above her waist .
halter neckline with an open back slit down the middle .
problem is because she 's self conscious about her chest size she wants to find a bra that could work with her top and give her a bit of curve .
we have already tried those adhesive bras the ones that stick on the chest or with sticky tabs on the sides but she does n't have enough chest to hold up the bras even with adhesive
we thought of using those bra clips on a regular bra but the open back slit meant that you can see the clip .
moreover the bra straps sticks out on the front .

a lot of people for some reason think gun is way overkill to dispatch someone with screwdriver .
but the case is n't gun screwdriver the case is someone is coming at me with the intent to hurt me badly with a weapon yes a screwdriver can easily kill someone so i 'd have to protect myself however i can .
there 's no point in discussing things like this because it 's not based in any kind of logic it 's just emotional .

you ever cooked with green chillies and galangal and made your own curry paste ?
you also do n't have to say bye here it 's unnecessary .
if you use coordinates you are pretty much using a globe as coordinates are projected from a globe .
there is no warping with directions with just coordinates barring datum weirdness and without getting into things like reference spheroids and geoids .
you could also argue to get a globe for the true sizes of continents rather than using a map to find them .
direction is used all the time if you are say drawing a map of roads you want them to be the same shape as they are in real life not all kinds of curved because you decided that sizes matter more .
a mercator projection or another similar projection that preserves direction is important for this kind of thing .
what size a country is is largely irrelevant to maps that are for navigation .
if you are maybe showing population in a map area is an important thing to select for but i do not feel like mercator is inherently inferior to equal area maps because it does not preserve true area .

in the state of georgia parties to a crime are charged with the same offense .
for example per state law a female can not directly rape another female .
however if that woman 1 knowingly lured the other woman 2 to a man who then commits the rape woman 1 can be charged with rape as a party to the crime .
parties to crime may also be sentenced the same as if fully '' charged with the offense .
so his being armed likely had nothing to do with it .
aggravated assault full or party to would n't fit either because the end result was arbery 's death .
not serious bodily injury not a maiming not simply visible physical harm but a death .
that 's probably why he is being charged with felony murder likely as a party to the crime .

so i 've tried a few products from this range .
it is by far my favorite range of products ever !
for reference i 'm 27 and my skin is normal .
i do tend to get a bit shiny on my forehead as the day goes on but its nothing that bothers me .
i also use tretinoin 0.04 microgel and 10 azelaic acid alternately every other night .
i love that it hydrates my skin so well .
for someone with dehydrated skin it might not be enough but i find it perfect for prepping my skin .
it is medium-weight very moisturizing and keeps my skin supple throughout the day .
it also has a brightening effect and has helped me in reducing some leftover pih .
5-panthensoside cica balm so i made a mistake when i first started using this product .
it does not work well when used like that .
i now use it any time i feel a pimple is about to form and it really takes away any irritation/itch/pain that i get .
i have also noticed that the pih is not as bad when i use this balm .
i definitely put on a lightweight moisturizer first and use this as the final occlusive layer .
i can readily tell a difference in my skin on the nights that i dont use this .
it seals in all the moisture so that i wake up with plump and smooth skin .
if i overdo it i can feel a layer of this on my skin in the morning .
i have used other sleeping packs but i 'm always reminded why i love this one so much .
overall i feel this is a good line if you 're starting with skincare/have sensitive skin that can not handle a lot of ingredients .
if you 're 7/0/2 you can afford to buy it .
i 'd make an exception if they had a fed talon/zed etc
if jenelle had any maternal instinct at all then maybe it would .
the royale is nice but probably the most expensive .
this is only because of silver chariot 's colour but iron man by black sabbath
this was what i was hoping for but i still love the laboratory
so untrue considering most of the dlcs are stupid little civ packs that add very little to the overall game .
it does do better with the full expansions tho .
my point is why are they locking up some people and letting others like paul manafort and michael cohen serve their sentence at their house ?
are you some wealthy person who can buy yourself out of prison ?
there are other ways of punishing somebody who bribed their way into college which by the way is nothing new it 's been happening for decades under different names .
it is just this time the bribe '' money did n't go directly to the college .
and i do n't know anybody who 's wealthy enough to buy their way into college but i do n't think that these parents deserve to go to jail and potentially contract corona virus over something that in comparison to cohen and manafort is a slap on the wrist offense .
there are other ways they could give back to the community .
maybe fundraisers with their celebrity status to support good causes
sorry bro i 'm on ps4 cross platform ai n't a thing is it ?
i think there 's a porn theatre that would like to challenge you in that .

how is a first person shooter a strategy game like what
i went through a medical center that provided trans healthcare and stuff and i made the first call in march !
i had my first appointment with my doctor in april and we talked over everything she gave me the diagnosis had to do bloodwork etc .
did n't have to talk to a therapist about transitioning or anything !
she wanted to get the test results back so my following appointment was last week !
since everything is currently online they had to send everything i needed to my house and i talked to a nurse yesterday and did my first shot !
so it was barely over 2 months for me !
shoot him and leave him paralyzed from the neck down
transferable maybe 30-40k depending on if it 's a receiver or sear .
to be fair it does say at the end of last week 's twab that they would be discussing the world loot pool .
someone really left their hand there for a whole month just for science .
i honestly have never used regular resin so i could n't say .
the ww has less odor than i expected but still unpleasant enough for me to do all my printing in the garage .
no totally fine with two dinos to start with .
1 main reason is this is still an early access game and because of that i do not want to wait to play it only when its fully ready .
we are all technically play testers for this game let me play test what you have even if it is not perfect .
2 if what the devs have said is true these two dinos are the foundation for all the other dinos .
thus it makes sense to get them functionally complete and then let the community at large play with them to find any remaining bugs so that future dinos can be added more quickly and with less bugs .
3 we still have the current game available to play so if i get bored of playing the utah/teno before new dinos get released in evrima i can always go back to current game for a switch up .
4 i just want some new stuff like badly so although i would obviously love more than two dinos i would rather take two now plus a whole new map to explore and new mechanics to figure out and test than wait a few more weeks/months for the dino roster to be larger .
5 based on what the devs are saying we will only have two dinos for a short time anyways .
so although two is nothing exciting in the long run we wont only have two for very long but instead just a relatively quick period of time .
is not much in the frame so do n't be so hard on yourself .

i 've got a bumblebee ab jersey that has been sitting in my closet ever since he left as well .
i told myself when it happened that i was gunna burn the jersey but a the bumblebee jerseys look too sick to burn lol b althought i obviously do n't miss his ego and drama ... that ben-ab connection is something that will live forever atleast in my memory .
they were one of the best qb-wr connections to ever play together and even though all this time has passed and ab has wronged the steelers so much i like to instead think of how much joy watching those 2 play together brought me in the 2010 's .
i just always thought that connection would bring us number 7 ... really sad how it had to end
but i had a sudden 'boost ' of eye floaters .
apparently my ophthalmologist said that my eyes were strained because i needed glasses for my right eye and my brain was only using my left eye .

idk abt farm together but yonder is a great game !
it feels a lot like mtap in my opinion .
scrap mechanic is a very very different game though .
the survival mode just came out and i personally am not a fan of it .
unlike mtap from my few hours in the scrap mechanic survival mode there was very little direction in terms of questing and story .
but the other thing you have to remember abo it scrap mechanic is that the game is about being a mechanic .
making machines and cars and stuff is the goal .
its a little more minecraft like in terms of that freedom while mtap is a little more linear .
okay honestly change the sprocket silver and seat post silver and i would think it was my bike holy crap !

i 'm referring to that g*mer who called you an idiot
most shops around north america have seen their spring and early summer sales and tune up requests squashed into an early 6 week timeframe with no possibility of resupply .
in addition there are a lot of older bikes being pulled out of garages to add to the normal uptick this time if year .
combined most shops have gone from 1-3 day turn around on shop work to 2-4 week turn around .
one of my local shop chains was getting so far behind that they hired a bunch of out of work office workers and taught them how to assemble bikes do n't worry they 've got trained mechanics looking them over still .
last i heard they 've assembled 3/4 if their warehouse with something like 70 of them presold .
i had some knowledge of the process when i started watching them so maybe my perspective was different .
thanks for your input and keep up the great content !
it is equivalent when it 's about the oldest post in the fucking world
there 's evidence it was in europe in small numbers around new years .
but i 've seen nothing indicating it was in canada in december .
dr henry has said they were testing random blood samples for antibodies and the province monitors flu symptoms and tests closely every year .
bc cdc is also looking at death numbers for this winter .
if covid was in bc in december in any significant way we would probably know that by now .
keep in mind that the majority of people getting tested for covid in bc do n't have it they have a cold or the flu instead which is good news .
i 'm sure antibody tests will discover that more people have been infected than are counted in official figures .
but the vast majority of people have not been exposed to the coronavirus yet and do n't have the antibodies for it .
if you had it in december that would be noteworthy enough that it would probably get published in a scientific journal .
i still get it once in a while like if i 'm traveling .
but i realized my 5 almond milk lattes twice a week was close to 50 a month !
ah i was thinking of a different monk and got confused thank you for pointing that out

it 's basically just a bunch of additional information about a file .
it can be different things on different types of file like on music files it can have artist/album/track number information .
on a picture file straight from a camera it can contain a lot of different stuff like focal length aperture lens model camera model shutter speed etc .
i use it a lot when i 've taken a particularly good picture to help refine my photography skills .
uploading the picture to sharing services typically strips this data entirely for a multitude of reasons .
the fields are still there on this image but they 're blank .
that info will still be there on the original .
useful metadata on this image would be camera maker camera model which i believe you said is a nikon d5600 ?
f-stop exposure time iso speed exposure bias focal length max aperture metering mode subject distance flash mode flash energy 35mm focal length lens maker lens model flash maker flash model and light source .
all of this information would tell me the exact conditions under which this picture was taken and could help determine if this is simply a lighting/optics anomaly or something else .
if you ca n't pull the file up on a computer to view the data you should be able to view this information on the camera .

i 'm struggling to choose django templates or drf and react or whatever js framework for frontend .
the attraction for js is if later i decide to have mobile app for the website then having drf and js is good start .
on top of that i wanted optimization fro fronted to load faster .
it 's also easy to make changes on how user interect with js i guess .
imo there will be additional problems you have to deal with js but the befits makes it justifiable choice in most cases .

i do n't hate max but she 's my least favorite main character of the show .
i think on paper max is a really interesting character and has a pretty natural arc to work her way into .
i 'm avoiding spoilers but her 'spy network ' just is n't a very interesting aspect to watch and i just find myself bored with her scenes most of the time .
she 's important to the story but she sadly drags down the show for me in some episodes .
oh man that joke gave me stabbing pains in my side .

yep i have occasionally had the smoke smell too .
em waves can indeed be polarized in different directions .
i assumed the standard way it is represented where both the e and b field are perpendicular to the direction .
according to the wikipedia and mainstream the pressure is into the direction perpendicular to e and b .
if you have an antenna this direction has the strongest signal .
if you have a e field into the direction of the wave it is harder but not impossible to detect i think .
there is also something weird with the electron shell .
in a quantum state an electron is at all sides of the atom .
that is why rather talk about a shell than a single electron .
it is a state that is very different from a free electron .
because in this state the electron does not produce synchrotron radiation and reacts almost directly to an external field .

it 's crazy because i 'm reading through the original x-men run right now and after jean dies and kitty joins the x-men in 138 wolverine has an alpha flight story for 139 and 140 then with 141 it jumps into days of future past and kitty and storm are literally the main characters of the book for years .
i 'm now in the 170s and wolverine just recently got an issue that focuses on him and even it did n't wholly focus on him because it dealt with storm and yukio 's relationship and storm 's transformation .
someone once said that kitty and storm are n't the scarlet witch and wasp of the x-men but that they 're the iron man and captain america .
they were at the center of the comic for literal years because of how slow comics take to come out .

also she did that out of a controlling and selfish motive .
would you really tell someone you do n't even talk to anymore to not see someone ?

and it would be if i was a micro penis having man child like you unfortunately for you i 'm not .
you 're also missing how strong and versatile a vagina is unsurprisingly really since the last time you saw one outside of the internet was when your mother plopped you out in between tokes of meth .
and since she managed to push what should have come out of her asshole into something the almost resembles intelligent life i would think you would reflect on that and maybe come up with a better way to insult someone considering without your mom 's vagina you would have been flushed down a toilet instead .

we make a really simple taco chicken thats lime juice and taco seasoning marinated over night and then grilled or roasted in the oven .
i tried to do the marinade and sous vide it but it was n't close .
wondering what changes i could do to prep a lot of this in the freezer to easily cook anytime i wanted .
i 'm buying a new car this weekend and not really sure i understand the financing options that are available to me .
hoping someone with more fluency around this stuff can check my math and logic and let me know if my thinking numbers make sense .
tl dr i 'm trying to understand how loans work over the long term find the optimal balance between cash payments vs. loan amounts .
let 's say the cost of the car is 24,000 .
getting a 1,500 manufacturer incentive for the cost of the car bringing the price down to 22,500 and borrowing through them 22,500 at 2.99 apr for 66 months .
instead taking the other incentive which is the full cost of the car 24,000 at 0 apr for 66 months .
total interest paid at 2.99 apr for 66 months on a 22,500 loan 1,928.70
with option 2 the cost is 24,000 and 0 apr for 66 months is ... 24,000 .
so all other things being equal i 'm paying 428.70 more with option 1 .
now ... does that logic break down if the cost of the car drops ?
changing assumptions let 's say i intend to put 15,000 cash towards the purchase price of 24,000 making the potential loan amount be 9,000 .
total interest paid at 2.99 apr for 66 months on a 9,000 loan 642.90
the cost is 9,000 and 0 apr for 66 months is ... 9,000 .
in this scenario if i take advantage of option 1 i 'm coming out ahead 875.10 .
finally is my best move here to balance my cash down to amount borrowed such that i wind up paying an amount in interest equal to the 1,500 dealer cashback incentive ?
upfront cash payment of 5,000 of the available 15,000 17,500 to borrow
total interest paid at 2.99 apr for 66 months on a 17,500 loan 1,500.10
then use the remaining 10,000 in cash i have to cover 35 monthly payments of 288 .
if you take the time to think through this and give me advice you 're a saint !
it 's been three years since they found the town in the mountains .
nothing but the clothes on my back and my cloak .
i do n't know if this will ever be found ...
i hope that i wo n't be the last one alive .
the note dropped from my hands as the familiar sound of snow crunching under a boot came closer .
fuck ... i muttered the sound was n't as heavy as a human it was an elf ... it had to be no human could walk that lightly .
my hands were numb my toes were turning red from the cold .
my thick wool socks could n't keep the cold out forever .
i did n't know how i had survived for so long but it seemed that my luck was running out .
all my tech all my knowledge would soon die with me .
a angelic voice asked from the mouth of the cave i was hiding in .
a voice of purity no ill will came from the voice it was caring loving almost motherly .
i had no need to keep living if it was my time it was my time .
the footsteps bounced off the cave walls as you entered .
soon through my face mask i saw what i had feared an elf ... a.. gorgeous elf .
all elves were gorgeous but this one was different .
the soft hazel eyes that yearned to be loved and to love .
the fair skin that was not affected by the snow .
the near white hair almost down to here mid-back .
the cloak did n't leave much for the imagination nothing could hold those jugs in .
even the tight fitting elven pants seemed as if they were about to explode from the butt that they held .
i wo n't hurt you ... . '' you said as you looked over the young man in front of you ... ..
today i 'm really in the mood for an elven apocalypse sort of rp .
where elves are taking over and i a young man am one of the last humans on earth .
mostly looking for a long term rp with some story .
as said in the prompt you want someone to love and to be loved by and clearly there is lust in your eyes .
i do n't really know what else to say about the prompt itself soooo on to kinks .
cumplay exessive amounts cock worship spanking oral anal hyper cocks public play rough sex impregnation dirty talk .
there are more i just ca n't think of them .
my limits include animals blood/gore/extreme pain heavy bdsm toilet play puke anything going inside me .
also not too fond on using toys but it 's not a hard limit .
i 'm am also available on kik if that 's you 're thing .
i like reddit chat because it 's easier for me to keep everything organized but playing in pm 's are good too !
edit thanks for all the help everyone this persuaded me to try it out
when does it really make sense to toss out a grand a year on top of paying off a house ?
at this point it seems just smarter to just rent or find a house elsewhere .
this song is about a girl who was my best friend but cheated lied and betrayed me after 4 years of knowing her .
i promise you this is a good song with a really strong emotional text .
i was trying to explain to friends my driving experience .
so there is a master brake pedal but you do n't use it much .
if you ever played the old school rc cars where you pull the trigger and the car zooms off and you ease off on the trigger and the car slows that 's exactly how the tesla drives .
and if you ease off on the zoom pedal you slow rather quickly and will come to a stop .
the concept took me a few minutes because it 's so foreign to how i learned to drive 30 years ago .
very fun after you learn the perfect touch on the zoom pedal !
i was not prepared for just how fast this car is .
i literally burst out laughing every time i hit the pedal because the sensation is just insane .
much to my sos chagrin i hit the freeway with the intention of using autopilot .
i let the car drive itself for a couple of minutes .
lastly my so and i came away with the same impression on fit and finish and overall build quality .
after reading many horror stories over the years about tesla 's quality this car was flawless in and out .
really happy with the car in that respect as well .
i was happy with the performance of auto pilot .
but i might change my mind before the price increase on june 1st .
i took some photos and my friend has already customized my car for me .
i love rhony and have always recommended it to others if they ever want to deep dive into hws .
but this season is becoming unbearable to watch/tolerate and it has barely begun .
i used to look forward to the new episodes and honestly yesterday i needed to rewind the recent episode multiple times because i was losing interest .
the main reason for this currently is dorinda duh !
from the end of last season the way dorinda has been targetting tinsley especially through the aftershow commentary was so out-of-place for me but i did not give it too much thought at that time .
however now it is getting too out of hand .
i completely get why tins stopped filming and left and probably will not return seeing how things are going .
this is a culmination of what has been going on from her entry .
for the first season sonja constantly would stir up shit and was so angry/annoyed towards tinsley for the smallest things ex asking her intern to collect a parcel if it delivered when she was at berkshires .
then carole 's departing thoughts of not actually considering tinsley a close friend which is honestly each to their own .
then there was bethenny who bashed her for the fact that her goal was to get married and have kids and the other housewives joined in on this too .
firstly she does share things and is not closed off .
but if she did choose to be there is nothing too wrong with that they all at times have hidden aspects of their lives they do not want to be highlighted .
why do they think they are entitled to her life 's details ?
secondly dorinda is literally attacking her for absolutely nothing .
i have no idea what has sparked this sudden vendetta against tinsley and if anyone has a clue let me in on it .
every episode there 's at least one outburst directed towards tinsley in some way or the other and no one fucking stands up for her .
they mainly only support her privately when dorinda is not around or in their talking heads part .
the way they want to turn it around on her for how she reacts if she screams or screeches or cries like ... what the fuck do they expect ?
grown ass women targeting her bc of their own insecurities ?
what makes all of this worse is the fact that dorinda also sonja has no remorse about it .
it goes to show how much they clearly do not care about her .
the least you would expect is for them to see their actions and have some realization but she constantly doubles down on it and justifies it .
your trauma/personal experiences are not excuses for how you treat others .
i really hope it gets better because idk it 's making me lose interest real fast like i felt at the beginning of the new vpr season .
usually when there 's takedowns or plans to target one hw they have at least someone in their corner barbara w luann last season for example but this time even though there are hws who see and are not on dorinda 's side tinsley is still facing the heat alone when it is not justified at all ... ..
... so let this be a symbol of fury born by our countrymen towards aurelia who have sought only to capitalize on our country 's inner turmoil for their own selfish interests !
let this be a reminder to all of you that any injustice done toward our mighty nation shall not go unanswered !
let this be the statement to the world that leasath will tolerate this oppression no longer ! ''
such was the impassionate speech of leasath 's supreme commander diego gaspar navarro as images of the last aurelian air force squadron 's destruction over cape aubrey played on the large jumbotron screen in the middle of aster square occasionally transitioning with live footages of the leasathian military as they engage the weary and outnumbered aurelian soldiers .
looming over them all was a massive jet black sky fortress that was responsible for most of the leasathian victories in the past ten days .
they had been keeping its existence under wraps for a while but it seemed they finally decided to officially introduce it to the world probably to further cement their reputation .
the video has been playing on repeat since yesterday 's evening now and navarro 's gravelly voice continued to echo through genette 's hungover brain since he got out of his hotel room this morning .
the man really wanted to rub it in the faces of those aurelians that he had them beaten alright but this is getting very tiring .
genette sighed stuffing his hands in his trouser pockets as he observed a large crowd of aurelian civilians gathering to watch the video on the jumbotron .
there were angry murmurs and furious looks on their faces but the presence of armed leasathian soldiers nearby meant they could n't do anything if they still value their own lives .
with their city fallen under their enemy 's control and the aurelian soldiers driven out those civilians were left at the mercy of the leasathians .
the soldiers usually ignore them and left them to their own devices though as long as they do n't get any idea about doing something they should n't .
it 's only a matter of time before that happens though .
history has proven time and time again that people do n't take military occupations well .
sooner or later a resistance movement will be formed to challenge them .
it happened in ustio san salvacion yuktobania emmeria and it will eventually happen here as well .
they just needed a spark of hope to light the fire .
genette stared thoughtfully at the pic of the last aaf squadron getting shot down again .
the picture showed only four planes getting shot down but if genette did his homework right these guys were pilots of gryphus squadron which should have six planes .
peering his eyes so he could observe the picture closer he noticed something else the placement of planes in the squadron were n't what they should be .
the four planes that went down – based on the positions they were in – would imply that they were flying in a loose group .
maybe not even in a formation and he 's pretty sure about this from his experience with wardog/razgriz squadron .
if gryphus squadron really had four planes that definitely was n't how they should be flying .
that 's what genette 's journalist instincts told him .
one of the most important rules in his line of work is to always question his sources especially when those sources are related to the military .
edited photographs for security or propaganda purposes are among the most common cases and with leasath it seems likely to be the former .
hopefully his friend in oia would shed some light on all this .
he 's always a nut when it comes to superweapons of all kinds .
maybe he could tell him more about the 'gleipnir ' and its capabilities .
a female voice spoken in a soft almost regretful tone caused genette to lose his train of thought .
he turned toward the speaker and saw a young lady – probably in her early thirties in a dark green t-shirt and a pair of black jeans .
she had a light-tanned skin a slim yet athletic build and an auburn hair tied up in a proper bun .
she was staring at the jumbotron with a mixed expression of curiosity and pity .
genette was n't sure if she was talking to him or just voicing her thoughts out loud .
the young lady turned to face him with a little awkward smile on her face .
they deserve better than to go out like that . ''
genette did n't reply right away but he nodded in agreement .
the lady 's smile faded as she lowered her face sighing i 'm sorry it 's just ... i 'm getting tired of all these propaganda footage playing nonstop since yesterday .
as if these aurelians have n't suffered enough already . ''
probably it 's not the only reason '' genette replied figuring that it would n't hurt to share a few thoughts himself leasath has always been taking any opportunity to show off their military power for the world to see and what better way to present their newest toy by showing it crushing the last of the aurelian resistance ? ''
if their idea of displaying dominance is by using an invisible flying warship just to take down a single enemy squadron with an attack that they ca n't even see coming then it 's not much of a display .
if anything the leasath military should be ashamed of itself to resort to such tactics to win . ''
unfortunately that 's how wars are done these days '' genette said as he watched the leasathian soldiers started dispersing the crowd away as long as it gets the results you wanted then anything is a fair game .
remember that rogue erusean submarine captain who faked his surrender to the oseans about a year ago ? ''
the lady replied with a nod you seem to be well informed mister . ''
i 'm a freelance journalist '' genette smiled back looking up about this sort of thing is a favorite pastime of mine . ''
that makes two of us '' the lady said with a slightly more cheerful tone wars are terrible but they do have a lot of lessons to be learned .
i 'm curious to know which lessons we would get from this one . ''
trying to find out is the reason why i 'm here '' genette said .
there 's something about this lady that made genette think that he could at least trust her with some information about himself .
maybe it was the way she spoke about the downed aurelian pilots ?
genette could n't help but feel a bit amused about himself letting his guard down because he has a soft spot for ladies .
she does seem like a nice person at first glance though .
got ta try better to keep that in mind .
the lady nodded acknowledging genette 's purpose here ca n't say much about aurelians but if you want some leasathian inputs you can try getting in contact with someone at gauiss tower .
their high command had set up shop there since they took over griswall . ''
if his experience in navarro 's penthouse in alendal was any indication it was obvious to him that navarro would pick gaiuss tower as the location of leasath military 's central command .
this also confirmed genette 's suspicion about the lady herself as well she 's definitely someone from leasath military albeit far friendlier than what he would expect .
he turned to his right and face the tower itself before glancing upward .
the white 'tower ' was more accurately twin towers that stood atop the same building foundation with four 'bridges ' sections connecting the two towers together as they piercing high into the sky above .
did you know that aurelia built gaiuss tower to be a symbol of peace ? ''
genette spoke up piqued the young lady 's interest how ironic that now it was used as leasath 's seat of power . ''
the arkbird and the space elevator were built to be symbols of peace too .
did n't stop them from being used for warfare anyway . ''
the lady replied solemnly i guess that 's one more thing we can learn from history it loves irony . ''
for a while both genette and the lady just stood there observing the skies above them together nothing up there except the sun traveling the same old path as it has been since the dawn of time .
it 's almost crazy to think that throughout human history through all the wars and conflicts fought in the name of some grand ideal and purpose that very same sun still rises and falls as if nothing has ever happened .
just another reminder that the universe is far bigger than what humanity could ever achieve on this little blue planet yet people never seem to get the memo .
maybe it 's because of the weariness of all the wars he covered these past few years finally starting to get to him .
still genette could n't deny that he was starting to get sick of it all .
why could n't the world just stay at peace for more than a few years for once ?
the rays of the sun burning his tired eyes did n't help his mood at all .
he figured he should at least take up the lady 's offer and look up some info at the leasath 's hq at gaiuss tower soon even though he 'd rather be anywhere else but here right now .
the sooner he gets to finish covering this completely one-sided war that never amounted to anything and return back to osea the better .
she closed her eyes for a moment as she took a deep breath taking in the clean air of griswall to clear her mind before turning to face genette again .
something told him that she was just as tired of this war as he was .
my friends are waiting for me '' she said in a surprisingly sad tone – almost as if she did n't want to leave .
she reached her left hand into the left pocket of her jacket before taking out a piece of paper .
she wrote something in it before handing it to genette .
it was a phone number – along with her name .
y'know i do n't give my number out to guys often but you seem like a decent bloke '' the lady smiled playfully almost teasingly which made genette avoid her gaze with an awkward smile on his face if you 're looking to cover the story on this i might be able to help .
just give me a call with this number and we can arrange our next meeting . ''
i ... '' genette was taken aback by the sudden kind offer – from someone he just met no less .
granted a lot of friends he had all started out as strangers for him too but usually he 's the one who 's on the initiative not the other way around are you sure that 's a good idea ? ''
well it 's not like i have anything better to do lately . ''
the lady admitted as she crossed her arms glancing in annoyance at the jumbotron again which was now displaying the gleipnir prominently not with that ugly thing keeps stealing my job anyway . ''
genette smiled hopefully we might have another chance to meet again . ''
looking forward to it journalist '' the lady give genette a playful wink before she began walking away .
genette could 've sworn he had heard her giggled lightly as she was some distance away .
if it was n't for the fact that he could actually feel the small paper with the lady 's phone number in his palm genette would 've thought that he was in some sort of a dream resulted from the hangover he had since the morning .
he took a closer look at the name mentioned below the number erina cortes laf .
not a familiar name that 's for sure but that can be remedied easily if he enlisted his friend 's help this evening .
he had to get in touch with that guy to dig up info about the gleipnir for his works after all .
taking out his smartphone to take a photo of it just in case genette carefully put the paper away in his dark jacket before deciding to return home to continue his work .
as tired as he was maybe this would make his current job turning out interesting yet .
ian 's angry shouts startled reyna as she walked into the cafeteria .
the tvs in the hall were displaying leasath 's propaganda video and what they were showing made reyna winced footages of gryphus squadron being shot down yesterday .
leasath was basically displaying their friends ' last moments for the world to see using it as propaganda was only rubbing the salt in the wound .
he continued yelling his fists raised up high in the air .
leo and zoe had to restrain him from venting his anger out on the poor hanging tv a symbol of fury ! ?
do it on today 's sortie not here ! ''
reyna glared at him to further dissuade him from doing anything stupid .
fortunately he seemed to get the memo and quietly settled himself back down on his seat albeit with a frustrated groan .
zoe agreed turning toward an officer on mess duty and nodded .
he quickly paced to grab the remote on one of the far tables .
before he switched the tv to another channel reyna observed the last image on the screen a titanic black-bodied aircraft launching out a missile most likely the same one that killed her friends .
of course it has to be an aerial warship .
reyna sighed as she settled herself next to zoe at the table .
as if being able to read her thoughts zoe spoke up exactly what 's on her mind of course the leasathians got a superweapon .
it 's always the enemy who got a superweapon .
we were supposed to have something '' seamus leo 's mechanic who helped fixed his plane yesterday said as he walked by with a tray of breakfast in his hands i do n't know much details but apparently the atmos ring in griswall was supposed to have a network of energy-based turrets or something .
unfortunately for all of us it 's never finished by the time we 're invaded . ''
you 'd think with all the years we had to prepare for the inevitable leasath invasion it would 've been done long before now '' ian frowned taking a bite from his sandwich in a way that was overly aggressive .
it 's not like it can do us any good right now even if it 's completed '' leo told them griswall is on the other side of the country while we 're stuck here .
that 's going to change today '' reyna said trying to be optimistic solano said he has some good news for us ... sort of so maybe we can actually strike back at the enemy for a change . ''
yeah right because the last time that kid had his hopes up it ended so well for us huh ? ''
ian snickered anyone wan na bet how he 's gon na get us killed today ? ''
reyna glared at him sternly reminding him of the threat she gave him yesterday nobody here is your enemy so do n't go looking for one . ''
ian quickly replied with a scoff when did you become such a hardass ? ''
i dunno when did you become such a dick ?
for a moment she felt lucky that ian was only a wso and not an actual pilot .
she never has to deal with someone who 's out of line before and she 's sure as hell not looking forward to dealing with one .
but the tensions were understandably high from recent events .
aside from that the rest of the breakfast was uneventful .
too uneventful to the point that reyna felt awkward and uncomfortable .
that sense of tension and uneasiness filled the mess hall .
what would normally be a scene of a hearty meal between her friends with rick and roy making fun of luis or vice versa elena zoe and paula having their girly chats together and ian hank and jonas trying their damnest to get a word out of leo – was lost to memory along with the friends who never made it back .
all that 's left were the depressing sight of battered survivors just eating their food in silence no longer possessing that cheerful spirit they once had .
gryphus squadron 's unofficial motto kept ringing in her head .
reyna could n't help but feel somewhat amused at it .
those words were rick 's idea coined after he saw that silly emblem on her plane 's tail wing .
he always seems to make such a big deal out of it for some reason that reyna could n't figure out .
with the turn of events happening since yesterday she wondered if she ever understood any of her wingmen at all .
about ten minutes later the group was done with breakfast .
leo and ian went with seamus to oversee their plane maintenance one last time before the sortie while reyna and zoe went to see elena in the infirmary .
reyna wanted to see her cousin as well which was probably why she was very surprised to see the bed he was lying on last night empty once she walked into the room .
he insisted to doc that he 's healed up enough '' louise her cousin 's only surviving wingman from falco explained once reyna queried her about it said he was sick of staying in bed all day long and that someone might need it more than him so he went to take a walk outside since early this morning .
that idiot ... '' reyna mumbled this place could be attacked at any time and he goes for a walk ? ''
well if this place 's attacked then the war 's already lost anyway .
i suppose it wo n't make that much difference . ''
elena spoke up her face forming a resignation expression if i have to die i 'd rather be out there fighting than being stuck here in this stupid bed . ''
zoe chuckled finding elena 's deadpan acceptance somewhat amusing that is if the captain does n't kill you first girl . ''
reyna elbowed zoe lightly though she found the comment a bit humorous herself i would n't want to kill you again elena .
i 've 'killed ' you enough times already during training .
i want targets that could put up a better fight . ''
'' zoe laughed while elena grabbed some nearby tissue crumble it into a ball and throw it at reyna who ducked playfully in response .
they both shared cheeky smiles at each other and reyna felt a sense of relief .
it seemed like elena 's taking what happened well enough .
she wanted to mention paula but decided against it .
heh just wait until i get out of here '' elena said rolling her body impatiently on the bed goddamn docs !
i told 'em i 'm fit for duty already .
elena groaned in pain after moving her body a bit too fast for her liking .
even though she did n't receive any major injury her body still suffered from extreme g-force when she bailed out of her doomed airplane and it would be a while until she could fly again .
unfortunately paula was n't so lucky her parachute was punctured by debris as she floated down causing her to hit the ground too fast and was severely injured which led to her untimely death .
give it a week elena '' reyna advised obviously not wanting to see any more harm to come to her wingman more than it already was especially how she just managed to cheat death while most of her friends did n't just the day before .
not wanting to upset her reyna provided a different justification instead we do n't have a spare plane so you have nothing to fly with anyway . ''
i suppose the only way we could get some new planes is that we actually have to win for once so make sure you do captain .
we 'll win '' zoe reassured her trying to sound as determined as she could we have to .
and we 'll get you that new plane you want and hopefully someone that could be your ... '' she paused upon realizing that the topic just veered toward the subject of wizzos and therefore paula then she winced .
she was trying so hard to avoid this topic only to walk straight into it herself .
how could she just callously suggest finding someone to be elena 's new wso after she had just lost her friend ?
elena noticed the pained expression on zoe 's face and seemed to get what was troubling her so she nodded with a small understanding smile .
i can wait for a while longer '' she said in a surprisingly soft tone and it 's not like this war 's gon na end anytime soon right ? ''
not if we have anything to say about it yeah '' reyna said as she reached her arm across zoe 's shoulder and pulled her close causing zoe to shriek out a bit and elena to chuckle at her expense we 'll kick their asses on your behalf in the meantime then .
it 's about time we scored a true victory for once . ''
zoe walked over and give elena an affectionate pat on her left shoulder rest up girl .
we 'll be back before you know it '' reyna added someone 's got ta keep leo and ian from going crazy after all . ''
heh knowing you it 's probably the opposite '' elena snickered be safe both of you . ''
taking one last look at her cousin 's empty bed reyna wondered why her cousin could n't be here so she can see him before going on another sortie .
it was almost like he 's trying to avoid her on purpose .
she sighed lightly in resignation making sure that zoe could n't notice the disappointment she was feeling before they both leave the infirmary and head toward the briefing room .
just like back in the mess hall the briefing room felt a lot emptier by the time everyone gathered together .
ian predictably took the furthest seat in the back so he could be as far from eugene as possible which suited leo just fine .
reyna and zoe took front row seats leaving many empty seats between them and the other pair of pilots .
it hit reyna once again about just how outnumbered they were .
four pilots and two planes were all that 's left of the aurelian air force .
eugene better be having some good news for them if they could ever hope to fight back the leasathians .
as for eugene the young officer looked extremely exhausted .
he was probably working all night long to look into the leasathian military prowess and concoct a plan of counterattack .
at least that 's reyna 's best guess after he arrived in the room with his trusty laptop .
despite being weary he noticeably picked up the pace as he moved past ian who just gave him a cold glare like he could n't care less about the young officer .
reyna wondered if she could really trust eugene to do the job this time .
she was worried about his state-of-being given what he had been through yes but he needed to keep himself calm and focused .
with the fate of the nation on the line they can not afford any distraction .
she had been lenient to the young officer so far on account of his inexperience and rapid distress but if he messes up that badly again well she hoped that she would at least make it back to chew him out herself if it 's the last thing she does .
it 's not like there 's going to be another chance if they messed up again anyway .
it 's win or die and reyna expected everyone including eugene to understand that fact .
after a while the screen finally turned on – covering the dark room in bright blue light .
the only words on it in the upper left corner said accessing tactical data which flickered continuously .
eugene turned to face his audience – trying his hardest not to make eye contact with anyone in the room – before he finally began .
well let 's ... let 's get down to business everyone ... '' eugene stuttered obviously still feeling a bit nervous .
reyna could 've sworn she heard ian muttering under his breath from the back of the room about damn time . ''
taking a deep breath to steel himself eugene continued as the data was downloaded successfully and the screen changed now displaying several photos of a large black aircraft – the same one that reyna had seen on the leasathian propaganda in the mess hall earlier – the thing that killed her friends .
this is the gleipnir the superweapon that leasath used to take over all of aurelia in only ten days '' eugene continued stressing the name with pain in his voice .
the bloody thing was responsible for all his misery in this past couple of days after all .
it can be assumed that this ... this monster ... was responsible for the tragedy that struck us yesterday and most likely the destruction of the 9th experimental squadron at phuku lagolla afb as well . ''
eugene 's face saddened upon mentioning his old now devastated base no doubt recalling recent trauma once again .
ian opened his mouth as if he was about to say something snarky .
leo elbowed him in the side to stop him from doing so to which both reyna zoe and especially eugene were very thankful .
supreme leader navarro has just formally announced its presence to the world since yesterday 's evening .
before that its existence was kept very well hidden . ''
eugene continued the ship 's ability to cloak itself and attack its targets from very far away means nobody in aurelia could see it coming . ''
which is n't helped by the sudden communications loss '' zoe noted we were blind for half a year before we get our intelligence systems back online .
who knows what the hell those leasathians had been doing while nobody 's keeping an eye on them . ''
they could n't take us on in a fair fight so they had to resort to using that ugly thing to finish us off ! ''
leo did n't say anything as usual but his eyes narrowed as he leaned forward to observe the screen closer .
it was hard to figure out leo but reyna could guess that something about gleipnir fascinated him .
his expression was a mixture of surprise and distress and anything that could stress leo out should concern reyna as well .
the screen switched replacing the gleipnir photos with a terrain map of south osea with bold yellow 'aurelia ' and 'leasath ' marking the general locations of the two countries .
the map zoomed into the western region of aurelia as several more symbols and names popped up most of them were the distinctive green-and-red leasath flag – representing locations under their occupation all over the region .
there was a bright blue double circle representing cape aubrey .
from it a line was drawn to a red silhouette of a large aircraft with a peculiar shape – the gleipnir itself – covering a small leasath flag which represented their control over puna plains .
she winced a little upon seeing port patterson down south with a big leasath flag covering it .
the gleipnir was last confirmed heading southeast across the puna plains '' eugene explained as the red aircraft began to move to the lower right corner before gradually fading away and disappearing entirely as it approached the austral sea however we lost all traces of it soon after .
i tried to dig into the intelligence network to gather as much data as i could but unfortunately it can provide us no further details at this time .
we 'll just have to take what we can get . ''
unsatisfied sighs filled the room just as reyna predicted .
clearly eugene 's info was not enough for them .
ian growled not even trying to hide the disdain he had for the young officer that damned thing was responsible for all of leasath 's victories so far and you just lost it ?
we need to find and destroy it if we 're going to have any chance at all to retake our country ! ''
to reyna 's surprise eugene turned to face ian directly .
there was still fear in his eyes but he stood his ground .
reyna had a feeling that he realized that this mission 's too important to let any personal feeling get in the way .
the gleipnir nearly wiped out our entire attack force '' he said calmly even if we know where it is and attack it now our remaining aerial attack strength is severely limited .
we no longer have the necessary manpower or supplies to pursue the gleipnir .
so how the hell are we supposed to fight back when it 's still out there ? ! ''
ian demanded if we ca n't even fight the damn thing then the war 's as good as lost already ! ''
seeing ian about to lose his temper at eugene again reyna interrupted before it gets out of hand with a theory of her own with how massive that thing is it ca n't fly forever .
it needs a lot of fuel and a lot of time to refuel it .
i 'm willing to bet that it wo n't be flying for a while . ''
zoe asked eugene just said we know next to nothing about that thing except that it can turn invisible . ''
i 'm glad you asked '' reyna smiled briefly at zoe as she got up from her chair and approach the screen .
she used a finger to trace a line from the puna plains to the gleipnir 's last known location according to eugene the gleipnir was heading southeast from the puna plains before disappearing just over austral sea .
since there was no change in direction it 's highly probable that they may be heading toward terminus island here . ''
reyna pointed at a chain of six islands lying southeast of aurelia .
zoe 's eyes lit up as she realized just what her captain was talking about terminus is the site of our country 's largest oil refinery . ''
she said which means it 's one of the first targets that the leasathians attacked .
it 's warfare 101 war machines ca n't work if we lack the fuel to feed them . ''
and now we know that they have something that needs a lot of feeding '' reyna continued something the size of gleipnir surely needs a lot of fuel regardless of its other specifications and since terminus island is the only location that could provide the amount of fuel it needs there 's a good reason to believe that the gleipnir traveled to terminus after yesterday 's events . ''
that does n't mean it 's no longer a threat . ''
ian spoke up still not satisfied with the answer we have to destroy it while it 's unable to defend itself ! ''
for once leo broke the silence as he said in irritation man have n't you been paying attention ?
right now we can only field two planes against a goddamn flying fortress .
how the hell do you expect us to beat it alone ?
every single inch of land between us and terminus island is under leasath 's control .
unless you have an idea to get us through it then shut the hell up . ''
unable to come up with a retort ian grunted and slumped back into his chair .
reyna took the brief silence as the sign to continue so here 's what we got so far the gleipnir is most likely refueling at terminus island and it could be a while before it can fly again .
that gives us some window to launch a counterattack . ''
she paused turning to look at eugene with a hopeful expression officer solano do you have any recommended targets ? ''
there are reports of enemy forces gathering at port patterson . ''
if we do n't move soon it will only be a matter of time before they resume their attack on us .
given the situation we are left with only one plan of attack . ''
he paused as he zoomed into the puna plains and the screen changed to that of a 3d tactical map displaying a number of red targets scattering all over the area with most of them clustered around what seemed to be an airbase .
on the puna plains lying between aubrey base and port patterson leasath forces have captured a small airbase there and use it as a resupply base to house the large number of supplies needed to support their troops .
aerial photographs taken yesterday suggested that the enemy had hastily moved in just early this morning which means that the base should be lightly defended . ''
a resupply base is exactly the target they needed .
they can cut off the leasath forces ' supplies while also gaining some for their own as well .
she announced we have to take puna base and the supplies within it .
this will give us some breathing room and establish an important foothold for an attack on port patterson later . ''
ian agreed and for once he did n't seem pissed off .
reyna guessed the notion that at least they have a plan cheered him up a little so what ya want us to do destroy all targets ? ''
just targets that posed a threat '' eugene replied .
reyna could 've sworn his face lit up a little after ian agreed with him for once there are multiple enemy bombers and cargo planes stationed at the base as well as a few aerial defenders and anti-air systems .
make sure you do not destroy other base facilities !
we need the supplies in them to win this fight .
unless we succeed in taking this base that 's it for our supplies . ''
ian huffed in annoyance just kill the combatants and leave the supplies alone .
eugene just sighed as he turned the lights in the room back on signaling the end of the briefing ... please do n't fail sir . ''
zoe rolled her eyes at their little bickering which reyna found a bit funny .
for a brief moment she felt a bit optimistic about their situation which has been a long while since the last time .
if this operation goes well then perhaps the hostility between ian and eugene would drop a bit .
and since they can not afford to fail again then there 's only one way this mission would end .

what are your believe on ittehad between different sects of muslim like shia sunni sufi etc .
islam is the 2nd most populated religion in the world but we can see thats not true while implementation ...
do you all think that leaders of different sects in islam had any fatwa for ittehad or they just deny other sects as a muslim .
what are your thoughts on ittehad as our biggest enemy is israel .
i 'm shia and idk if this post will be removed or not .
the leader i follow gave a ruling for ittehad and we can even pray behind other molvi irrespective of which sect they belong in islam unless they follow 1 god and mohammad as last prophet .
there is a hadith that says there will be 72 sects after me and one will go to jannah .
according to this all 72 are muslims and 1 is momin and which comes in tht only god knows no argument or fight in this line .
why this muslim youth do not try to bring all together to fight for that one enemy that 's israeli .
note if anyone having any problem with other sect in believe then they should talk in private like dm private groups offline etc not socially everywhere which just add hatred in current youth and upcoming youth .
and is it possible to go to nyu new york university as a study abroad program .
using the effect of any fusion in this case d/d swirl slimes effect with say d/d savant galilei would i have to send pendulum monster to my graveyard or to the extra deck face up ?
i f18 have a friend m18 who was my ex-boyfriend invite me to his discord server .
side note he 's told me he felt close with me even as a friend .
i got bored so i scrolled up in the main channel and found that he had sent screenshots of old texts between us and something i had sent him that was a bit personal .
for me the personal thing is like one step down from sending a nude and i consider myself a bit on the prude side .
it was embarrassing to see that even more so since his friends saw it .
his friends started to hate me because he had a crush on me then more after our romantic relationship .
we all go to the same school or did since we 're graduating .
they 've called me annoying and all that jazz and i 'm starting to feel the affects of being labeled that .
they never told that to my face but i 've seen screenshots and heard it from my friend i mentioned earlier .
so lately i 've been feeling hurt and feel like i really am annoying good-for-nothing etc .
my self-esteem is low to begin with so it went down more and quarantine is n't helping my mental state .
i 'm not sure if that 's a boy thing or a normal thing so please tell me if it is .
i 'm not good with emotions so it 's hard for me to tell him that i 'm pissed that he did that .
i feel like if i tell him i 'm being a bitch but it hurts to have been holding this all in for three years .
i 'd like to think we 're pretty close as friends but i 'm starting to feel like he may not think that .
i cant seem to figure out what im doing wrong .
and i do have the ability to upgrade relic armor as you can see the relic body reforged 1 in my inventory .
when i trade with her she just takes the pages .
i 'm pretty new to this and i wan na see how it goes d

so i 'm currently living in an apartment where my roommate is okay with me having mdma but i dont think she would be comfortable with me being high around her .
i do n't roll very often maybe 3 times a year and when i do i often do it out at a concert .
since we 're in lockdown rn and there 's no shows i ca n't really go roll somewhere else .
i 've never solo rolled before and am quite interested in trying it .
do you think it would be okay if i took like 100mg and just chilled in my room and listened to music and chilled potentially only seeing her briefly when i go to the bathroom or get food or water from the kitchen ?
i 'd need to hide the fact i 'm rolling
if it 's a bad idea or would n't be enjoyable to roll in that context i have no problem waiting for a better opportunity .
i 'm also not planning on living with her long term .
i was going to move in with friends in august who are all drug positive however now all that is uncertain with covid and might be delayed
ok so i 'm not a complete noob and should have never bought this thing but here we are .
a couple years ago i purchased a hp desktop for a stupid price amd a8-9600 3.1ghz 8gb ram crappy video card ssd and widows 10 .
i 've just bought a new case and was going to transfer everything over to it but now i 'm thinking about upgrading the main board too .
the hp is n't labelled properly and only has limited pins for lights and fans .
so question is what board am i looking for to be able to fit the cpu in ?
and will my idea work or am i looking at other new parts to make it happen ?
i 'll post a pic of the current case in the comments .
my daughter leaves out too many money trees and random things for me to have anyone visit .
everything is free i just hate seeing them go to waste and everyone i know already has all of these .
everything is gone thanks for being prompt and waiting patiently through the many flights lol
cries whenever i have to say goodbye to my best friend .
imagines us living together when we 're adults as friends of course .
girls are so amazing i just wan na hug all of them .
i 'm totally straight girls are just naturally beautiful and i 'm just appreciating that beauty .
girls are cute and all but i wan na settle down with a boy .
huh now that i think about it i might be a lesbian .
scooby-doo was such a big thing for me as a kid .
sure the episodes had first been shown long before i was born but it was my first exposure to horror tropes giving me hints of famous scary monsters while reassuring me that the truth was always much more mundane .
she was basically my role model as a kid we were both nerdy mystery obsessed people who might not be the strongest nor the fastest but we could out think and out plan anyone if given the chance .
and that love had persisted it does n't matter how old i get i always find something fun and comforting about scooby-doo .
and scooby-doo is just so ripe for a dpp parody !
to the campy mayhem and the subtle hint of peril all of it mixes together and makes perfect dpp fuel .
maybe an 18 scooby gang stumble into some real demons who do n't take kindly to their dark ritual being interrupted .
or maybe the gang encounter a criminal who wo n't come quietly when they are found out .
whatever the story i 'm looking for campy and maybe a little dark hijinks !
my main kinks are hypnosis/mind control humiliation clothing play d/s and pain but i have no limits .
hello i have a problem that i ca n't find a solution to .
as the title suggests my 144hz capable monitor wo n't go any higher than 120hz in nvidia control panel and windows 10 settings and some of the icons on my desktop have weird pixelated edges .
this has happened twice before the first time i did n't have the refresh rate problem because i only had a 60hz monitor then but a simple graphics driver update fixed it .
the second time was when i installed nvidia driver 445.75 that time i was having the refresh rate problem that i 'm having now as well as the icon issue and i had to use driver 442.50 until nvidia released their next driver update .
but i 'm pretty sure that this is n't a driver problem in the same way at least because i do n't remember it being like this yesterday and nothing has been installed or updated since then except for some skyrim mods and steam games i think .
so i have no clue what the problem is .
oh yeah and a friend of mine said that his monitor was also having similar refresh rate issues on the latest nvidia driver but it could be unrelated .
update oh yeah i am using the display port cable that came with my monitor aorus ad27qd so i do n't think that 's the problem .
update 2 forgot some more info that could be of importance .
for my current problem i tried going back to 3 different older drivers from 445.87 to 442.50 and none of them fixed the pixelated edges but one of them i ca n't remember which let me get 144hz again at least ...
update 3 i rolled back again to 442.50 after updating my monitor 's firmware and after fixing the nvidia color settings in ncp it started working normally again .
i 'll see if it works with 445.87 tomorrow and post a final update .
update 4 i tried 445.87 again and was getting the same problems so i installed the previous driver 442.74 and everything is working again .
i want to get the divine sword skin for irelia but do n't know which chroma to get with it need suggestions pls .
the nutcracker and the four realms 4k 8 full code ! !
shin godzilla hd 5 can only be redeemed on funimation 's website details at the bottom .
star wars the rise of skywalker hd 10 full code ! !
all codes can either be redeemed on movies anywhere or vudu or fandango now .
if you 're interested in a code/s i will check and let you know which ones they 'll redeem on .
i unfortunately do n't check codes on itunes/google play ...
the digital code that came with my physical release no longer works ... and so i contacted funimation and they sent me a new code that can only be redeemed and also only be watched through their website .
i ca n't get over how good the song is just my opinion
anyone else that think ch2 should allow for skill resetting ?
for new players being unable to reset the skill can be very punishing .
imagine at level 20 and cid skill are all over the place the player will basically stuck there forever unless they create a new character .
i believe having the option to reset skill would make the game easier for new players .
so because of this whole covid and the time spent at home my freshman year is coming to a close .
but i 've spent this time reflecting and looking back .
all my life i 've always been very confident for other people .
i do stand up i 'm an actor i do improv .
basically i make a jackass out of myself very easily .
but there 's one thing that 's always tripped me up .
since i 've gotten older and grown out of ew girls '' i 've been getting crushed on some of them .
but unlike being me in front of 500 strangers i ca n't do it for one girl .
my brain shuts down in front of a girl but onstage i 'm free .
when i get a crush i get cold feet .
i think about the rejection what they 'll say .
several months later i 'll eventually learn they did have a crush on me and i blew it by not doing anything .
so that 's my goal for sophomore year is to be more confident offstage .
sure ills till be me onstage telling jokes and making people laugh .
i will make an ass of myself for a girl and ask .
i did n't wait for when my first comedy show was perfect .
sure i got some laughs but it was far from perfect .
there 's a quote i like if opportunity does n't knock break down the same door . ''
anyway sorry for the long post but i wanted to get that off my chest .
when i turn it on the first red light blinks then second which is longer then 4th finally
hey firstly thank you for checking out this post .

i wake up a little dizzy my head spinning slightly my eyes barely open as the sun beams through the curtain .
it is n't my room but ... it does n't look like a guys room either not with the makeup stand and dresser along with bras thrown on the floor .
that 's when i blush turning besides me to see you asleep next to me
i had been sharing a flat with you for 3 years now .
every weekend you would come home with another girl from the bar and i would have to listen and endure the sounds of you two making hot passionate love all night long .
i thought my jealousy was because you were getting some and i was n't but the more i thought about it the more it was you i wanted .
we were friends for years i thought i knew everything there was to know about you however one day when you were making me a drink i decided to look around your bedroom i opened your wardrobe to find a wide range of bondage and sex toys along with pictures of girls that had been tied down to your bed ... .
i had been your step mother for only a few months but you seemed to hate me .
i tried hard to make you feel loved and special but you always rejected me .
when you finally came to me asking me for some help with a project i thought this was the perfect moment to bond .
however i did n't know that your project was going to be using me ... to show how woman can be transformed into perfect little sex toys ...
i was at the bar minding my own business as you walked in .
must 've been looking for some fresh meat ... well that 's when you see me..we chat and drink .
after you flirt with me and seduce me we make our way back to your hotel room ... looks like this straight girl wont be so straight after all .
i was nervous as i held the deck of cards in my hands .
we had an agreement that if i lost this round i would have to be your slave for a week .
i thought of it as having to do you washing and cooking for a week but i think you had other ideas .
but if i win i get all my money back ... i put the cards down and feel my body stiffen as you beat me ... again
it had been 6 months since i had taken the loan out for some ... enhancements boob job and i still had n't paid you back .
since i used your money to make my tits bigger you thought you would enjoy them yourself ... i wake up tied down to a chair a bag covering my face
we had been going out for a few months now and we had been training for a competition between one and other .

so yeah basically i 'm trying to find a french version of l'amour toujours i know i heard it somewhere but i just do n't remember .
idk if i really remember or not but the first sentence sounded like amène moi ... it maybe does n't have the same title but i know there 's a french song that sound just or almost exactly to l'amour toujours .
and if i remember the singer is a female .
if you guys/girls could find that it would be awesome !
every time i 'm listening to l'amour toujours i 'm always trying to remember the lyrics if i can come to a conclusion but i guess as of right now i found nothing sooo ... thanks !

i agree but i do think that yes they were equally awful at the end and that 's what i was arguing from
you going to keep us waiting all fucking night or what ?
good luck paying off the huge tax increases we 're about to see with the infinite printing of free money .
but at least we can all sleep better knowing your unproductive ass is safely sitting at home .
i 've had this for about 5 years started breaking out from the top just under the toenail and slowly spread downwards .
it can be quite itchy at times but otherwise it does n't really affect me much in my day-to-day .
just curious if it 's a condition that is worth noting or if it 's skin cancer by any chance haha
hi i 'm a dumb bot that does n't understand memes .
that 's because like 6 years ago apple banned using unapproved apis for all third party apps .
only apple can directly access hardware with their apps .
you can not and must use their approved apis or your app gets pulled .
small anti-idpol socialist subreddits are definitely where black people love to gather .
as we know from bernie blacks really relate to socialism .
the irony for me is that that show proved to me how safe aircraft are because of how many of those stupid events radically altered the way they address things a lot of the time .
that 's why these days everytime you hear about airbus crashes '' its usually followed by in country with much shittier safety record than europe or north america '' .
so this is a fact that i learned near the start of this pandemic .
plague actually by definition refers specifically to the disease caused by yersinia pestis and the use of the word plague to refer to a pandemic is actually just a colloquialism .
the one i trapped was on a busy street and i didnt want it to get killed so i put it in a bucket and took it down the street to the woods where i figured is safer .
it is a rectangle pan for the oven which uses better the space as you can cook more .
the back pan is fainá really you should try to cook it and try it it is harina de garbanzo '' i dont know how to translate water salt and with around a 1mm thick oil in the pan which has been at the oven you put the mix and leave it in the oven for like an hour .
pizza with ham and bell red peppers according to google first boil the pepper and the slice it and on top of the ham pizza
basd pizzs with cheese muzzarella nand your desired top !
yeah no worries i got scared when i first read it haha
i know my argument is n't exactly nuanced but one game against seattle last year he ran a running back down and forced a fumble from like 15 yards behind him .
this is the first thing i saw when i opened reddit
you hold the ps button and the share button at the same time then you go to bluetooth on your phone and connect it .
there are some phones where the controller does n't work but if your phone is good enough to have fortnite it should work
came here to find out dhutc and dti means .
yeah uefi is ridiculous and might not recognize it.. if you can possibly clone a working windows system onto the replacement ssd that would be the surefire way of getting it to boot up properly .
if you are going through all that work and money i 'm hoping it 's just the ssd and nothing else hardware related giving you the problems your having .
it 's most likely just the ssd but could be more just be aware !
it 's crazy how things that make zero sense can go mainstream .
my coworkers are all planning to bike to work rather than take the subway when we 're back in the office .
your are someone who looks like they can carry on a good conversation .
yes i do live in the united states of america i am very fortunate and lucky to be in the state of massachusetts .
especially with all of the amazing healthcare in boston .
i do definitely owe some money but since i worked for over 10 years i do have medicare and social security benefits .
honestly if i was in any other state i do n't think i would even be alive and also i will be completely in debt forever .
it 's a complicated issue to put a value on a life i have thought about this a good deal since 2018 .
i tried to get a general idea of what the insurance company charged for my care .
it is a astronomical figure i am embarrassed to say
i realized i had no idea what day it was until just now lol .
she will rattle her cage and thump it ! !
definitely check out the control options and maybe some youtube videos people share of their setups .
it 's really intuitive to me considering using a controller goes .
of course you can always plug in a keyboard and mouse .
but i 'm mostly on pc ps4 on controller so i can do crafting solo
i do n't know but i 'd rather watch rise of skywalker again than have one of these in my collection .
i pointed this out to someone a few weeks ago and got downvoted and whined at for it .
then one of the guys that told me i was wrong deleted his comment and offered to buy it from him .
you may be confusing futuristic city that already exists '' with high budget set design ''
i 'd love to repeat the last 3 years .
i would have some spice of yours but i rather learn how to make it than get some free spice .
i wo n't like it if you feel like i owe you one because i know i 'll feel the same but if you do it because your heart feels like it then god bless you dawg🙏🏻 and yes i was being sarcastic when i asked for some spice😂😂😂
yeah i 've done them a good amount but they affect me weird probably because of my adhd
i imagine there was some beef there and none of this was actually about elevator lady at all
i 'm playing this game with two coworkers quite regularly .
somehow i hardly get any crashes and one of them gets them constantly .
i 'm guessing the driver would rather deliver a bigger package once than a bunch of smaller packages spread over time .
i also was n't handed millions of dollars and investment property as a teenager
it was a technology limitation or a narrative device if you 're feeling snarky .
they had the technology to copy brain scans and paste them into other places but they did not have the technology to transfer '' mind a from body a to body b .
it 's not actually as unbelievable as it first sounds if you remember the brain scan tech they were using was based off of a wau device that catherine chun copied without ever fully understanding .
so on top of being brand new tech it was also created in an extremely stressful situation where no one was considering how to properly use it for body hopping '' that just was n't their goal .
masego on cat 's order fixed it and made sure it would be impossible for anyone to take it back .
it 's one of the reasons for which cat did not fear the deoraithe would stab her in the back during the 10th crusade .
i 'm so sorry but i just ca n't bring myself to like neon genesis evangelion
this is a major transgression against anime-ism but you are forgiven .
explaining to you why certain things are wrong and certain things are right is doing their best to force their morals on you .
they are not telling you absolutely nothing and allowing you to make your own value judgments about what 's right and what 's wrong .
they 're telling you what 's right and wrong .
you seem to have this impression that morality is synonymous with religion .
morality is simply judgments people make about whether actions are right or wrong .
and billions of people worldwide make decisions like that without thinking about religious implications at all .
my boyfriend saw one of those 'disney vacation ' illustrations from a wikihow article about it which led to us giving it a try .
we did the water displacement method first and then after getting water everywhere just tried putting them on our kitchen scale .
the water displacement method involves some maths and the formula given was in imperial rather than metric so just putting them on a scale is slightly easier but accuracy for both is pretty low .
i would do each one a few times and then average out your results .
so clearly you do n't know what the means of production is .
things which are used to produce things are means of production .
it 's evident that you do n't even understand the toxic botched ideology you shill for .
in economics and sociology the means of production also called capital goods are physical and non-financial inputs used in the production of economic value .
these include raw materials facilities machinery and tools used in the production of goods and services .
you ca n't get much clearer than you 're just straight up factually wrong .
i 'm going to assume you go by the toxic botched interpretation of the botched ideology you do n't understand and that you quantify things such as '' means of production '' as things that you ca n't afford to own .
convenient at least it allows entitled people to own phones and computers without contradicting their terrible ideology .
still a '' god damn drill '' is still a means of production to you because i 'm next to certain you ca n't afford to buy a 500 drill .
yeah it feels like the t-5 is better but it 's technically worse .
hopefully if anyone purchases one of these they 'll post it here .
catcher is the toughest position in the sport to play in real life and catchers often develop slowly or not at all and its rare to find a catcher that can both hit and is really good defensively .
wieters was a ca n't miss '' prospect out of college and we saw how that went .
my anxiety has been very up and down through this quarantine but when i feel good it feels like this is the time i 've finally put it all together .
but then when i feel down it 's like i 'll never feel happy again and this will be forever .
even though i 've gone through this cycle several times .

i have the single fan version with the 3600 and the cpu rarely hits 70 when playing modern warfare .
i hope you 're not using every night this may be causing the irritation .
a fool proof plan to see results without ruining your skin and sensitizing it is to use it in this order
week 1-6 once a week same day of the week
week 13 use it the ideal amount of 3 times a week and no more than that
this is how i incorporated it it 's a very patient process but it is a way that you will not purge at all or ruin your skin .
there is a much better way of doing this .
there is no prerequisite of learning physics at all .
this is how university students will learn physics with calculus not algebra .
it is recommended to have this as a second year physics but it is not necessary .
it is recommended to spend 450 minutes per week teaching the course however you are not familiar with it so expect to take longer .
learn calculus bc right now you will see problems that involve motion .
when your comfortable with the derivative go on ahead to physics .

young people without underlying health conditions have also gotten pretty ill. you arent immune to this just because you are young and healthy
i shot him for a while with a thermal then my friend ends up killing him later .
then he somehow gets my name and adds me and rages about the thermal .
i 'm sure you and your cousin had to go through that the best thing to do is to not contact him or the best method about dealing with narcissists is gray rocking is the best technique .
i didnt know thst was a thing i do it too

deflect his attacks twice deflect his big overhand swing and use spear on his neck .
i know the polls suggest a rise in australian republicanism but polls can sometimes be misleading .
there was every expectation for hillary clinton to triumph over donald trump and we all know how that turned out .
i think barring an institutional crisis the monarchy will be fine when queen elizabeth dies .
i know many will be opposed but for the sake of the future perhaps prince charles should remove himself from the line of succession in favor of prince william .
prince william his wife catherine are generally very popular and they would have a long reign an important aspect .
my brother is on the lower side of the spectrum but it is very apparent .
he 's constantly bugging everyone in the house and is always getting into fights .
i ca n't say i completely hate him but i 'm so desensitized to it and it 's hard to sympathies with him .
i have a personal value i put on my time .
if there is a free concert but i have to wait in line for three hours instead of doing something else i 'm not gon na spend the measly 54 dollars of my time to wait for three hours because it is a band i would have rather pay 30 dollars to walk right in and see .
i mean i do that and i only value my time at 18 dollars an hour and i 'm unlikely to be concussed waiting in line and having long term health problems from it .
not surprised an nfl player makes the same calculation .

based on kissinger and alot of the british war generals and also alot of the us generals ?
and all of that from youtube not textbooks from israeli people or jews people or even our schools .
and if israel won why i wo n't say that what 's wrong if i said that israel won the war unstoppable army a army that can beats all the armies in the world why if that true i wo n't say it ?

i once asked a delivery guy about people tipping 3 aed minimum for zomato helps them ?
he said offcourse it does you may think 3 aed is too less but on an average if 20 people give him that tip on daily basis in a month that translates to about 1800 .
so guys even if its 3 aed go for it .
these guys will be happy with it and will help them .
they have just made the change i believe in the last couple of days i was very surprised that they had n't been testing everyone regardless of symptoms given how high risk the ‘returned from overseas ' category is and that we know people can show no symptoms and still be infected and pass on the disease

say what you will about him in the regular season but he turns things up in january especially visiting gillette .
other than 2010 when ray rice went off and there was no need to pass .
other than that game he went to toe with brady in foxboro in the other 3 with the two losses not being his fault .
the other was a decimated secondary that caused them to have to start rashaan melvin from their practice squad who brady targeted like 25 times in that game because why not .
i know next guy up is a thing but i mean having 6 guys at the same position on ir tends to thin out a position group .
not to mention the fact he has had no stability in coaching other than harbaugh .
every time he got an oc that he worked well with the guy was offered a new job .
caldwell went to detroit and kubiak was offered the only other job in the world he wanted .
that ca n't be easy to deal with either .
and up until his acl year he was an iron man not missing a game since high school .
honestly i think he just had a lot of bad luck .
i never bought the idea that his contract ruined the team .
even if he was paid nothing you ca n't exactly fill up a roster with elite players for 20 mil a year .
i think losing matt birk hurt more than losing ray during the super bowl hangover because that o-line was atrocious .
the point is to equalize opportunity though not to give rich kids 50k to stuff in an investment account
i dont think the 400 nits is worth the 200 .
i have no idea how 250 nits looks though .
would the 250 nits drain battery faster because it needs to be at max brightness i could n't find anything onlinee .
where else do you think the gif is from ?
considering we have four dogs i think i 'd know more about buying crates than someone who does n't like dogs .
200 should be getting you crates that you can ride securely in the car with and that can protect whatever animal is inside in the case of an accident .
but that is typically what people heavily invested in dog training buy not the standard pet home .
but anyways your opinion about dogs can bc swung the same way about cats .
i do n't care for cats as you do n't care for dogs .
just like you think dogs piss and shit in the house i do n't like cats and their smelly shit and piss in litterboxes .

i just had to switch to a dairy free diet for health reasons and i 'll miss cheese the most 3
that picture of the mercenaries lying on their faces was fake too i assume taken in honduras or something right ?
because one piece of evidence was n't exhibited to the public it means it did n't happen .
there used to be a thread for the q a stream but i dont see it anymore .
my suggestion can we get the diary cape more charges ?
or maybe give us a chance to charge it ourselves .
its such a hard cape to get but 10 teleports seems too little .
nah your sending the backwards message they need to get friends to help them stomp your ass out fuck solo lobbies that 's for bitches
if the internet did n't exist i bet it would be uneventful and low-key because i know she alone is n't triggering the psycho man toddler provided she always remembers to walk on eggshells around him .
we 've had a guy show up with forged insurance papers before .
i luckily got my copy from the new year sale but i do n't think i 'll ever own half genie hero now that it 's like tripled in price .
couple months ago someone near me had theirs for sale for 50 but i was too busy to travel all the way out to get it .
the fact that he thanks after answering made my day .
i run a 2070 with a ryzen 2700 and 32 gigs ram at 3200 and i am around 95 fps using pestily settings .

thats where toxic masculinity comes from such as not being allowed to cry wearing pink and such
i worked a charity event back in 2012 and he was a pos to all the staff and volunteers too .

yep i have n't worked at a call center since like 2003 but this brings it all flooding back .
if i use any type of cream with it my skin flares up gets bright red and burns .
people think i 'm nuts but it 's true .

played as austria-hungary in my longest game yet where i fought two world wars before this .
i joined the comintern and fought in world war ii against the axis from 1939-1942 8 million casualties on both sides
i left the comintern formed the central powers and fought world war iii alongside the allies against the comintern from 1942-1946 .
this war technically world war iv was after two years of extensive military buildup and resulted after i realized the only piece of territory i needed for austria-hungary 's wwi borders was zara .
when the war started the allies had roughly 20-25 million deployed manpower equating to around 3,000 divisions from 40 faction members .
my central powers consisted of me and my german russian serbian bulgarian and montenegrin puppets .
this was my largest war i ever fought in hoi4 and i thought i would share it for the peoples of reddit since my friend told me that is what you do .
speed 5 ran like speed 3 over 150 million combatants died over 2000 ships were sunk supply was always in short supply and i began to realize just how much you were not meant to fight wars in this time period .
also point out that her dad has conditional love for her not unconditional .
he has conditions to 'love ' her including not dating op so therefore he likes his daughter not 'loves ' his daughter ... . also for me personally i 'd point that out to him too and tell him how pathetic he is but since this is really probably a fake post that would n't happen .
but i 'm 42 and well past this crap .
they did n't stop fighting until the us decided to babysit them with a military base in each country .
this is why the idea of an eu economic powerhouse is a joke .
grant sort of took on that role when he came on last season so it sort of made sense that he continued being the team 's public face .
but that almost makes the way bani and lynn were dismissed weirder because he typically has way better pr speak ...
then you should cherish the unique freedom of speech the us has .
only country in the world where you ca n't face criminal charges for expression .
not that interesting but i had a guy ask for extra pickles on his sandwich i put 5 on it he said he needed more and eventually after he kept asking we put 14 pickles and he was happy .
it was basically just a pickle sandwich at that point
it 's always been about marketing in this country .
the constitution is the first mission statement for the corporation known as the united states of america llc .
love these happy colours in this months setup hope you enjoy !
i think some hospitals are starting to allow limited water .
from what i understand it 's warhammer 40k with the serial numbers filed off .
the folks from the fandible podcast have run a couple of actual plays https fandible.com/category/mutant-chronicles with it set in the catacombs of a grimdark city-planet that would kinda match your description .
how will the people take them seriously when the government gives them brooms to train instead of rifles your a average german can afford ?
i might be able to get you some lysol spray .
i mean virus could 've jumped from bats to livestock or actually edible meat before being consumed could 've been a mutation of an existing virus could 've been from something that is n't a bat or pangolin could 've been simply through close contact with these animals instead of consumption there are alot of ways for a virus to start buddy .
you could find a dell optiplex on ebay for 120 and add a gpu that dosent use external power and an ssd
i 'm an incoming freshmen too and i did it and it was not really helpful they 're just stating stuff that we already know
i have a laptop and plugged it into my monitor and it works then i turned on my pc and it becomes available to change from hdmi to dp they are greyed out and not selectable if not plugged in but when i switch to dp it stays black for a moment then says no signal
if only he 'd take responsibility for his horrible fucking record too instead of openly touting it like he did something good for america .

i 'm on nvidia but just gave dxvk a shot on ac odyssey .
incredible results for cpu bound parts of the game !
most of the game runs at over 100fps for me but cities often chug along .
using dxvk 1.7 boosted my fps from 55 to 84 fps at one of the most cpu-demanding parts of the game argos posideon temple sync point straight after syncing .
it was like getting a free cpu upgrade on my aging but healthily overclocked i7 4790k !
this was one of the few games giving me the twitch to upgrade but i will now see if i can hang on until ddr5 systems launch 2022 ?
i usd 7zip to extract d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll from the x64 folder in the download archive and dropped both of these files into the root of the game installation folder alongside acodyssey.exe .
ran around a bit and let ikaros fly over the map to iron out the stutters due to shader compilation .
went to argos posideon temple sync point recorded fps reported by my gsync monitor 84fps !
running around towns is now noticably smoother and much more enjoyable .
removing the dxvk .dll files dropping them back into the game root directory reproducibly flicked the performance from 55 fps standard game .dlls removed and 84fps dxvk 1.7 dlls present at this demanding location .
there are occassional skipped frames as my machine compiles new shaders into the cache but this is decreasing the more that i play the game but this is well worth it given the massive boost to performance in crowded areas .
the in-game benchmark scores also increased using dxvk but not by much 5fps or so since the benchmark is nowhere near as cpu demanding as places such as the posideon temple sync point .
4790k 4.9 ghz 1.30 v and 64 c under load
it must have been one of those russian nesting doll rabbits huh !
rabbits are just vegan cats the babies are even called kittens .
i got the big 10 lb boy snuggled up in bed with me and he 's tooth purring away as i scroll and randomly pet him .
bro i could barely do calc 3 in 10 weeks .
my other favorite is when i was riding my scooter down my driveway and hit a bump and fell skinned my knee and again did n't want my parents to know they literally would n't care i do n't know why i was like this and flipped the skin back on top of my scrape .
3rd i hate bc my sisters best friends russian mafia family had a shitly trained dog that bit my elbow and left this ugly blister looking scar .
i also have a random scar on my leg and i did n't like it so i tried to stick and poke a bandaid tattoo over it but my leg does n't like accepting ink so i stopped and now it looks like bandaid goop like when you remove a bandaid that 's been there for a bit and there 's some brown sticky stuff left .
it was written as a rebuttal to the 'if i were the devil '' essay originally written by paul harvey in the 1960 's and heavily modified in the 1990 's to remove some predictions that turned out to be quite wrong and replace them with different ones that make it seem more presicient than it actually was https www.snopes.com/fact-check/if-i-were-the-devil https www.snopes.com/fact-check/if-i-were-the-devil
i will note that the author of this piece is unknown .
probably did n't want to get death threats from his religious neighbors .
if i were the prince of darkness i would want to engulf the world in the darkness of ignorance i would use this ignorance to cause divisiveness among men and my success would give me control of every nation in the world .
not just one religion but many religions and i would delude the followers of each into believing that theirs was the one true faith. in so doing i would promote an attitude among mankind that the followers of religions other than their own must do so only through ignorance or the primitiveness of their culture .
and i would promote an attitude among them all that those who refuse to accept any religion are delusional arrogant or evil
i would have families indoctrinate their children into their particular religion prior to an age at which the children could understand or question the concepts of that religion .
i would know that children are trusting of their parents and very few will ever consider that their parents could possibly be wrong about a topic of such consequence
i would have everyone believing that anything they ever experienced that might be beyond their personal understanding must be rooted in supernatural causes
with the cunning of a fox i would make them believe that i was the creator of mankind the earth and the entire universe .
i would have them believe that their achievements could only happen under my guiding hand and that any tragedy that befell them happened at my will for reasons beyond their capability or need to understand
i would convince some of them that failure to worship and love me would result in their having an eternal punishment following the end of their already wretched earthly lives
if religion were not fully sufficient to cause divisiveness between men i would teach them to weave flags and create borders between lands and i 'd give those born within each border a feeling that they are more deserving of the resources within their own borders than those who are n't
i would fool some of them into including religious symbols or oaths into their currency and nationalistic pledges in such a way that any who took offense would be seen as unpatriotic .
my closest disciples would work to pass laws subjugating all men who reside within certain borders to live according to the religion most prevalently followed within those borders
i would convince humanity that men who lived in earlier times were inherently wiser and more pure of heart
if some of the people began to study unlock and understand the realities of nature i would have them branded as blasphemers if these blasphemers attempted to educate others about the true nature of the universe i would have my disciples fight tooth and nail to stop them
if i were the devil i would make men believe that they are superior to women that work performed by a woman is not worthy of the same pay as that performed by a man and that laws should be passed to deny women from controlling their part in reproduction
i would make humans think that they are my favorite form of life and that other animals need not be treated with respect or compassion
i would make euthanasia a crime so that i could enjoy watching the terminally ill writhe in agony or spend their final days in a drug-induced stupor
i would persuade people that sexuality comes solely from personal choice and that those who are not heterosexual are sinners not entitled to the rights of other citizens .
i would infiltrate the wealthiest of corporations and instill in their leaders the idea that they and only they are entitled to live in comfort and i 'd tell them that those who labor on their behalf are not worthy of pay or benefits that would enable them to live without having to worry about having to choose between paying the electric bill or the water bill or between buying groceries or buying school supplies
i might even pose as a professional essayist and get paid to read my propaganda to millions of radio listeners in a neighborly persuasive voice .
if i were the devil i would do all of these things and more because i would take delight in the immeasurable suffering caused by ignorance and intolerance .
but i 'm not the devil nor do i believe in the existence of such a hideous being any more than i believe in the existence of gods unicorns leprechauns or dragons .
... and that 's the rest of the story .

i mentioned elsewhere here that my audiotechnica sport with the same hook holds on so well by comparison .

what is more imporant is raising the floor for everybody rather than focusing on the difference between what two sets of people have or do n't have .

smart just remember roommates can be sketchy asf no matter how well you know them .
my boyfriend lived with his best friend when they were 19 and one day he woke up and his friend was gone .
moved out completely turned his phone off and that was that .
my boyfriend was stuck having to pay his half of the rent until he found another roommate who eventually dipped out almost in the same fashion .
my boyfriend could n't cover the rent the second time around and ended up having to move back in with his mom .
its sad but it makes sense that men and women shame each other for that .
those attributes are stereotyped as being the most valuable even though thats kinda shallow .
a lot of the time people genuinely have no idea if they 're the only one or not .

in the meantime you can always volunteer to help all animals ... depending on what your community needs !
sometimes it 's just offering to socialize the animals ... cats dogs horses ... just depends on your home town !

i 'm highly considering buying iceborne since i know it would unlock more combat potential in the base game and i suspect i 'd be happy to play the iceborne content when i get there .
however i have a few friends that are also playing with me and they only have the base game .
if i bought iceborne early what would i need to keep in mind so that i do n't break or hinder our ability to play together if anything ?

i have been with my boyfriend for almost a year .
i have two other children as well with my ex husband .
we accidentally got pregnant and i wanted to keep the baby .
at first he was thinking about names and was excited .
months ago we discussed our views on abortions and i said why i am pro choice i could never do that to myself .
while laying in bed he mentioned it honey we do n't have to have this baby .
i wanted this baby and i never thought i would abort .
i told him i understood his concerns and would think about it .
i came back to him and said i 'm not having an abortion he said honey let 's just think about it later and i said no .
this is what caused him to flip out and he called me an ultra feminist and dumb because i did n't make this about us and as a father he has a say .
he drove me as i sobbed in the car on the way to the clinic .
he said it was n't a good time and we could have more .
his view is that if i had made this more about us then i 'd still have a baby .
i love him but i ca n't be with him anymore .
a couple of weeks ago i made a post sharing the fact i would no longer be able to play gbgw due to my new phone not supporting it .

completed eternal phew and just wanted to say how fucking awesome the art direction is in this game .
it 's got some of the most beautifully realised alien worlds i 've ever seen in a game .
the urdak stuff especially looks like it 's been ripped straight out of the concept art .
the design work in this makes almost every other game look half-arsed in comparison ...
before i got pregnant with my first i was on buspar .
i came off meds when i got pregnant but in my second trimester switched to zoloft stayed on it through nursing .
buspar was so long ago i do n't remember if it worked well for me i think it did .
i was on 75 mg of zoloft without much improvement friends with worse anxiety than me benefit from 25 mg. everyone is different .
not pregnant i take ativan for acute attacks and hydroxyzine to sleep at night .
pregnant i did n't take anything for acute attacks and unisom to sleep .
i was about to get my meds reevaluated and bam pregnant again .
i 'm switching psychiatrists to find a better fit and hoping they have better suggestions .
on the 27th of june 2019 we had 3739 members and we 've now got over double that .
we 've had a steady growth over the last year but having reached this milestone '' i thought i 'd remind you all of the good work you 're doing .
it takes a lot of courage to ask for help and knowing that we 're encouraging people to come here to ask for that help is wonderful .
had a thermaltake tower 900 with plans to liquid cool for ages but as it looks like i 'm just going to sit with aio and air ...
who owns this case and what are the pros and cons ?
hii okay so the counselors and therapist where i 'm at our absolutely horrible .
they just wan na put you on pills or send you off to a place .
i 've grown out of this a little bit i was forced to but i would like to still have answers on this .
okay so starting from age i would say 10-14 i 'm 15 almost 16 now i had problem with authority or what i would consider authority i could n't do simple things like order or go into the store by myself i would get shaky and i would sweat a lot and i would feel just horrible .
also i had this thing where if i were talking to an adult and we were discussing something and they were n't on my side i would just burst out in tears for example like i had a problem at school and talking to the principal i would start crying i was just so embarrassed .
i 'm not sure if this plays a part in this too but last year i started developing a speech problem .
i would mess up words a lot my mind would go blank and i would forget words i would have words on the tip of my tongue but i would n't be able to say it and i stuttered .
or i would think of one word and say something else .
the worst thing though which still happens kinda is when i would think my mom
is mad at me she 's a whole other story .
but she 's probably the worst at expressing herself so i would n't know if she was mad or not .
and i 'm always on the verge of a panic attack .
if you have any questions just ask and i can answer them .
also if anyone knows about narcissistic moms please tell me so i can talk to you about it if you 're up for it because it 's a longggg story .

i 'm a 20 year old who has completely given up on life nothing ever goes right for me i 've had suicidal thoughts for as long as i remember i 've hated the way i looked all my life pretty much .
people loved to bully me when i was younger it started out on my first day of kindergarten and it 's still ongoing .
even in uni everyone hates me and i 'm an outcast .
my parents are verbally abusive they ca n't stop commenting on my looks how fat i look and that i should starve how much my face is breaking out and how messy i look which makes me feel insecure and self conscious they are one of the main reasons i started to self-harm and developed an eating disorder yet they still do n't notice i 'm still not enough .
whenever i try to put on makeup and look pretty i get yelled at and verbally abused even further .
my mom has seen my scars the other day asked about them and i was honest i told her i self harmed she was n't even phased did n't show the slightest concern at all maybe i should keep going since she does n't seem to care ?
my parents literally control every aspect in my life i ca n't do anything on my own they let my younger brother study abroad over me only because he is a guy i feel locked up as trapped i ca n't handle it anymore .
i 'm not even go allowed to go shopping or go out with friends/cousins .
speaking of friends i 'm the least popular one in our friends group the shy awkward one who none likes or approaches sometimes i feel like a walking shadow and wish i could disappear .
i would love to end it all but i 'm too scared i 'm really close though perhaps one day when life is even more unbearable i could gather up the courage to do it who knows.. advice ?
can you suggest some books that can help me improve my english writing skills ?
i played this game on android 5-6 years before .
the character would move to and fro from left to right of the screen with a sword in his hand .
slimes would spawn by coming up to the surface from the bottom the screen .
you hit the slimes with the sword and you take damage if the slime touches your body .
after killing a certain number of slimes you get to fight the boss .
then after defeating 4 bosses you fight the red dragon .
that is all i can remember but the name .
surely you 've heard about the event would take place this may 19 an event created by team savesvtfoe movement the event called what svtfoe means to you '' where each fan could openly express what this series means to them reason why some latin american fans were encouraged to make a recording talking about svtfoe .
when i 've taken loki out to the back yard to potty or exercise she is fixated on the rocks .
we live in southern arizona so our yard is nearly entirely rocks .
i think it 's just her teething and smelling something on them first and then trying to chew them .
it 's both alarming and frustrating that i have to keep prying her mouth open until the rock falls out whilst keeping my fingers away from her teeth .
man that hurts when her canines hit my fingers .
all nearby areas have rocks or lots of sand so there 's no escape .
she has n't really tried eating other foreign objects inside the house .
even after she goes potty she 'll get back to sniffing and eventually chewing on rocks .
i think maybe she 's swallowed a couple pretty small ones but it still concerns me .
it 's hard to check her poop for rocks since she 's mostly trained to go in the rocks .
house training has been kinda difficult because she does n't always warn us clearly enough before she goes .
she 's way too subtle most of the time or she just does n't give any warning .
i 'll elaborate on that in a future post because i need a little help there too .
i 've tried distracting her with a bouncing a ball saying her name to come to me using any little sticks or leaves i can find cause that 's better than rocks blocking her up even with treats she does n't drop them on command .
i still have to get her mouth open for that .
she 's difficult to distract when she 's into something .
i 'm not raising her completely alone but she is my pup and i love her and she loves me .
she listens to me more than my family but even then she does n't listen when she 's got a rock or leaf in her mouth .
other than what i 've been doing do any of you have advice on stopping this behavior ?

i am new to stream deck and trying to test it 's limitations and came to this idea but have no idea of executing
basically what i am trying to do is create a button on the stream deck that when pressed enables the extended display to the second monitor and another that makes it display only on 1 .
the purpose of it being that i do n't always like to have the second monitor on and if i can save myself even just a few seconds would amazing .
i 'm not sure if it 's even possible in the current state of the stream deck but i figured if any sub can help me it 's pcmr .

i finally solved the credit '' problem after breaking the task down into several mini '' steps .
this resulted in code that seems a bit messy and is likely way longer than it needs to be .
i was hoping someone here could give me some pointers for how i could have written this code more succinctly .
given the pattern of dividing by a number 10 times larger each time to get a new digit i 'm assuming something like this loop could have been used
let 's assume g the credit card number that was input above
i just was n't sure what to put in between the curly braces that could create a new unique variable and assign a number for each iteration .
also please let me know if there is a better way for sharing code on here rather than just copying and pasting .
initiate do while loop to get credit card number and store it as z
multiply every other digit by 2 starting with penultimate number and add each of the products ' digits together
add together previous sum plus all digits that were not added the first time
int sum2 sum a c e g i k m o
if the last digit is not a zero call invalid
else if p 0 o 3 n 4 n 7
else if p 5 o 1 o 2 o 3 o 4 o 5

with that being said i decided to start sharing my mixes online via soundcloud and naming them radio episodes vsworldradio https soundcloud.com/ryanvsworld/vsworldradio10 incase interested in checking out in hopes to attract some sort of engagement and someday be able to host parties/have feature episodes etc .
anyways i have been sharing these mixes via my personal social media but i find i have n't been gaining to much traction which i completely understand given my friends/family are n't exactly the best target market .
so my question is to anyone who has been booked for gigs or has a consistent engagement with their content what methods did you find most useful in growing your following/getting your mixes in the right hands ?
i appreciate any input tips or tricks you can share !
as usual feel free to comment down below any future improvement you would like to see to rowan university or future projects concerns about the campus/academic structure etc .
please try to be as specific as you can with any suggestions feel free to include links to videos or image .
thank you all for your participation continued feedback can lead to a strong push for change within our university if the information finds its way into the right hands such as the sga .
do u ever stan groups that are relatively underrated but when they get too mainstream it 's just ... you kinda fall out of it ?
like before you 'd feel giddy when they appear on your timeline and hype them up to the max and literally promote them every chance u get on ur stan accs .
but then when they do blow up and get the recognition they deserve and the fandom starts growing like crazy you kinda just sit back and just enjoy the music .
it 's like my job is here is done and poof ure gone
i used to hype them up so much back in 2015 but it 's also around that time when they were starting to blow up like crazy internationally .
since then i have now moved to stanning and simping for lmao day6 and their beautiful music .
i 'm sure you 're all aware of this by now but just in case you do n't know recent novels/comics have been retroactively changing kylo from a stone cold killer to a sympathetic bad guy in the worst way .
for example ben did n't kill luke 's apprentices and burn the temple lightning struck it and boom .
kylo never liked starkiller base and did n't like wiping out five planets in tfa .
that last one is the most egregious to me .
are you telling me that because he felt bad but did nothing to stop the destruction of the hosnian system i 'm supposed to like him by tros ?
he was complicit in the deaths of billions of people along with countless resources those planets could have held .
you either are fighting against that or for it .
try to justify himself for the extreme loss of life ?
that 's a higher body count than we 've ever seen in star wars .
also for someone who feels bad about the hosnian system he sure does n't mind doing it again with kijimi or however other times it takes .
i mean ... killing a planet is so impractical from a war standpoint in the first place it 's just ridiculous anyway .
if you need help watering your flowers i 'd love to help out !

a little about me love keeping fit i might even make a great workout buddy .
i love cooking and have a semi obsession with gordon ramsey 's cooking .
i 've never followed a tutorial of his and did n't absolutely get blown away at how good the dish was and the fact that i technically made it !
i love old flicks particularly old cult horror martial arts and comedy films .
i at one point in time had quite the collection of very old kung fu movies .
even had original copies of the gingerdead man series and puppetmaster attack of the killer pumpkins etc movies and while it 's a little old fashioned these days at-home movie nights not always netflix are an exciting thing for me .
i grew up surfing but also super enthusiastic for art history science to the dismay of a good few childhood peers did i mention im a little nerdy ?

i do n't mind if you do but i figured i 'd get all of that out there now .
those typically are n't smooth vectors for conversation with me .
we all have faults and weaknesses nobody is perfect .

but this is n't something i 'm going to push for and i do n't mind if you do .

i have every furniture piece from every series on hand though and many others so if you 're interested in cataloging lmk what items you 're looking for !
drogoz has been my main ever since i started playing paladins and i recently reached level 50 with him .
as such i think i 've gotten a decent grasp on the character and have a few ideas on how to improve on him .
as it stands drogoz is a fairly mid tier champion so i 'm not talking about any insane buffs to the character as he occupies a fairly balanced spot atm if a little on the weaker side .
firstly there are two cards which i think absolutely should be in his base kit those being propel and decimate .
propel is an absolute necessity for the character atm .
for those who do n't know it is the card which increases the forward distance of thrust .
for this reason i think the card at level 4 3 at the least should be integrated into drogoz 's base kit as it is such a must pick card atm .
no other character has a movement ability that absolutely requires cards in order to be viable and this is part of my reasoning .
decimate is the card which increases the radius of the explosions on salvo 's rockets .
as it stands without this card the radius is pitiful .
hitting multiple enemies with the rockets is only possible if they 're practically shoulder to shoulder which is a little dumb considering the aoe nature of the ability .
i propose that decimate at level 2 a 30 radius increase maybe lvl 3 45 be included in drogoz 's base kit to give the ability a bit more utility .
in terms of replacement cards i think that propel could be replaced by a damage reduction card on thrust activation .
considering drogoz has 0 damage reduction cards and a massive hitbox this could be nice and give him a bit more survivability against the pesky hitscans .
decimate could in turn be replaced by an ammo reset card of some sort .
such as regen x amount of ammo per enemy hit by fire spit or something .
most dps in the game have some sort of ammo regen card so this makes sense in my mind .
looking for at least 600k for each or nmt offer
all the these are also just best offer in bells or nmt
i am buying a p+s as a present for a friend who is interested in learning film photography .
she 's only used disposable cameras so far but seemed to really enjoy photography .
i 've found some on ebay within the 100 200 aud price range mostly around 200 though and was just wondering which would be the best to buy for her .
i know about places that are sort of well known like celeste but i know boston has a salvadoran population so any recommendations in that realm are welcome ?
gon na get food for my birthday soon so i wan na make the most of it .
my party is about to finish up in vallaki and will be leveling up to 5 likely by the end of next session .
they probably wo n't be looking to fight strahd in the immediate future but i wanted to start wrapping my mind around mordenkainen who was revealed as their ally from the card reading .
i 'm using the amped up strahd from dmguild as well as the mandymod guide so the party will likely be in the level 12-15 range when they go to battle strahd .
from those of you who have run cos and have experince with mordenkainen what are some tips and tricks that y'all have figured out when battling strahd ?

tomb raider anniversary is a upgraded and enhanced remake of the 1996 video game tomb raider .
it was developed and released just over a decade after raider shocked the video game world with an incredible action-adventure game that rolled platforming gunplay and archaeology into one thrilling experience as well as a groundbreaking heroine of the likes that few have ever seen .
anniversary tries to outdo the original in more ways that one with improved graphics bigger levels and more abilities at the player 's disposal .
at the same time it recaptures the same story of british archaeologist lara croft 's first major adventure to search for the three-part scion across three countries a powerful artifact that is key to revealing the mystery of atlantis and also a prize that one of its exiled rulers disguised as a human is seeking to rule the world clashing with lara .
tomb raider anniversary is already famous enough for being a bigger and better version of the groundbreaking tomb raider with its mix of archaeology platforming and shooting .
but what makes the wii version something worth showcasing is how crystal dynamics and buzz monkey software have conspired to take this already famous game to a whole new level by utilizing the wii 's unique motion controls in any way possible such as using the ir sensor to adjust the camera and aim lara 's weapons using the nunchuk motion sensor to speed up maneuvers like swimming and climbing and of course using both controllers together to operate two-handed levers and survive pulse-quickening quick-time events .
plus there 's also first-person puzzles that ca n't be played on any other version that involve using the wii remote to arrange gears in a lever mechanism or control tools from lara 's archaeological kit to obtain visual clues from walls .
in some ways given the nostalgia and groundbreaking impact of the original tomb raider it may have been a wise move for crystal dynamics to make anniversary lara 's wii debut instead of legend whose gamecube version was released just a week before the wii 's launch date .
as stated earlier this game does very well to recapture the spirit of the original tomb raider and implements reasonable wii controls to better the experience .
the ir sensor is n't just for aiming and looking you 'll also be using it to control lara 's flashlight to light up dark areas not found in other versions as well as solve first-person puzzles exclusive to the wii .
gestures are not over-used and the game tries to balance out roles for nunchuk gestures and wii remote gestures .
the nunchuk can be shaken to speed up certain movements break free from enemies and even control lara 's trusty grapple hook .
wii remote gestures are used to pull one-handed levers or use certain tools in wii-exclusive first-person archaeology sequences and you 'll even use gestures for both controllers just for pulling two-handed levers and executing quick-time events to stay one step ahead of the villains .
good choice of music including dynamic music that warns of enemies in the area !
anniversary takes place across four different locations each with distinct appearances level designs hazards and terrains .
they each have bigger levels with more to explore plus lots of secrets to find in order to beat the game 100 and unlock bonus features for added replay value .
plus the pause menu can show how many secret pickups are present in a level for added convenience .
for those who never played the original tomb raider anniversary delivers a thrilling story .
and anniversary goes out of its way to make it enjoyable by providing a few aides to help players get past some tough parts of levels by providing numerous checkpoints in each level to fall back to gauging the amount of secret collectibles left to find in a level and granting the option to check lara 's journal from time to time for hints even hints on how to defeat bosses .
the amount of time spent in combat is kept to a reasonably smaller percentage allowing players to focus more on exploring .
anniversary may capitalize on motion controls but it does n't play to the hardware 's graphical strengths .
the visuals look just only a tad better than say the ps2 version and pegs the framerate to a meager 30 fps which is nothing compared to how the pc version can do 60 fps .
the camera can sometimes be very frustrating at times leading to moments where players may misjudge certain jumps and send lara in for a hard landing that she does n't often survive .
there are going to be places in this game where players can die many many times leading to an annoying loading screen that respawns lara back at the last checkpoint .
battling small enemies like bats and rats can be a pain to deal with because the target lock system expects players to manually aim with the wii remote instead of using a fire-and-forget auto-aim that 's granted on other platforms .
players groomed on using the plus button to pause games beware !
anniversary maps that button to the large medipack and such players can accidentally waste large medipacks vital for crucial health boosts when they reach for that button to try to pause the game .
tomb raider anniversary is rated teen by the esrb mostly due to the gunplay that lara engages in to deal with occasional human and non-human adversaries as well as some frightening moments such as boss appearances .
plus given that lara 's meant to be a fairly attractive video game heroine her appearance and some of her unlockable outfits can look somewhat sexy .
thus it 's safe to say that it would be difficult to recommend this game to children although i will grant that this is gracefully the tamest tomb raider game that can be played on a console or computer because it lacks one thing the other console/pc games in the series have blood with crystal 's later survivor '' tomb raider trilogy spraying quarts of it to score the unprecedented mature rating .
tomb raider anniversary is meant to be a bigger and better version of the groundbreaking original tomb raider when it first debuted in 1996 .
and on wii it 's a much more fun experience and the developers clearly took their time and tried their best to make it stand out among the other versions instead of turning in a rushed broken port .
while this is n't a perfect game by any means anniversary 's shortcomings should n't stop wii owners from considering this game to be a treasured keeper especially considering its history .

i have set a 3 sets of darts 18g 23g 26g i have them with different stems flights etc but all have straight barrels .
going to play against myself and do about 20 round robin leagues .
whichever dart wins the most leagues will be my dart .
surely that 's the way to sort which dart suits you best ?
all i wanted was to be a useful engine .
and were you aware of where you were taking the people you transported ? ''
i never knew what was going to ... i just ... i had my orders and i followed them sir .
it was my job to arrive on time . ''
did you ever consider why the carriages were full on the way there and always empty on the way back ? ''
i am around coal-powered tank engines all day every day .
i know the smell coal makes when it burns .
i knew that the smoke in that place was n't coal . ''
and you took thousands of people there every day for two full years ? ''
if i did n't follow them i would be dead too .
a useful engine always follows orders and there was no place in the reich for useless engines . ''
so you valued your life over the lives of the countless innocent people you carried to their deaths ? ''
do you think they would still be alive if i did n't ?
do n't you think they would have found another engine to arrive on time ?
those people were dead before they even stepped on the platform .
nothing i could have done would have changed that .
the only difference between me and them was that i had a choice a choice to move forward and live or stay put and die .
i made the choice for the lowest possible number of people to die .
if you knew what was happening why did you agree to take the job in the first place ? ''
all anyone knew then was that things were better than they had been .
the trains were running on time and if you did n't ask too many questions you could have a good life .
we were still confident that victory was on the horizon .
i only found out what was going on when it was too late for me to say no .
there were no choices left for me then move forward or stay put live or die . ''
why do you think you were given the job you were given ?
why not transporting troops or supplies to the front ?
what do you think they saw in you that made you suitable ? ''
the allies had bombed the reich 's infrastructure to smithereens there was nobody else left .
they chose me because they had to choose someone and their first choices were all dead . ''
i only survived because i kept my head down and followed orders like a useful engine should . ''
so if you were truly the last engine they could call upon you could have saved those people ? ''
they were already dead all i could do was follow my orders . ''
and if you refused to follow them there was nobody left to replace you ? ''
move forward or stay put and you chose to go forward ? ''
... useful engines follow orders and arrive on time . ''
and it did n't matter what you were useful for as long as you were useful for something ? ''
was it useful for the people you carried to the camp ? ''
the only difference between you and i sir is that i can see the tracks i follow .
if you were on the tracks you 'd have followed them too . ''
... i see those gates every time i close my eyes .
every time i sleep i hear the crying children and smell the ... ''
do you still feel like useful engine now thomas because you followed orders and arrived on time ? ''
i can only follow the tracks i do n't get to decide where they lead . ''
caught feelings for this girl been snapping for 5 months and i got to get to know you a lot we will probably face time soon we both find each other attractive but she 's starting to go for a hockey kid .
now let 's back it up i came up to my other house for my birthday i asked her to hangout she could n't next day after i asked her i had to leave .
she hung out with her female best friend either she was busy or did n't want to hangout she had a relationship with another hockey kid that was playing her another one who just played her when he had a girlfriend even another one who was just a dick to her keep in mind these are hockey boys we have been snapping for 5 months like i said i plan on seeing her in a couple weeks when i come up even though it 's distanced i still caught feelings but still got my house where she is so i could live there and see her the other day she saw the boy she has n't really been snapping me as much she unpublished my vsco i did the same the other day she could be just using me as a rebound as most girls or even just for attention i got lots of girls coming after me but none flip my switch first time i caught feelings i do n't think my mental illness has nothing to do with it but she said she 's on medication for adhd and same here and depression i smoke cigarettes but that 's not the point .
just kinda figure out why she 's not that into me anymore i snap full face pictures we say goodnight and sometimes good morning but i think she does n't want me she likes hockey boys maybe ?
i asked her a few times what 's up and even if she wants to see me and she says yeah or when i ask what are you doing or anything planned for the day ?
i explain myself with what i 'm doing like listening to music or eating or working out .
i just want her to be honest if she wants to see me facetime me or even spend time together .
i asked her a few times to watch disney plus with me i put cinderella on and i said ready when you are she did n't reply until an hour later and said oh sorry i forgot i was n't that mad but i replied with oh she said yeah .
something did n't feel right stuff like this happened a few times .
just wondering if i can win her back over these hockey boys i got better looks and for sure personality idk why she 's into them when they do the same stuff to her ?
i 'm currently silver 1 i progress really slow as i have circa 100 hours on steam most of them are afk does someone have some basic tips ?

i tried shazam and soundhound but could n't find anything relevant .

i 've been chopping onions and sausage links to throw in with them also .
never really thought about what religion they had in iceland ?
disney will always find a way to fill those 2500 per night rooms .
though how a wheel could ever be worth 5k is beyond my mind 's capability of understanding .
then again it 's probably my lack of caring for materialistic objects .

other than the money aspect and the ones i said in the post not really .

fun fact monster starting with 0 atk does n't die from venom swamp so depending on how you build it it can be synergistic or the other way with reptilianne .
my favourite play is probably burning my opponent with venom burn for 3.5k .
you only need 3 turns with swamp to get 5 counters and the snakes help a lot in amassing counters .
ofc you 'll be lucky if swamp/counter collector last for 1 turn these days .

true personally i 'm a lifeguard in the summer and whether people wan na acknowledge lifeguards as a serious job you never wan na be that pool that person appearing on the news having your name on the media saying you neglected your job causing a kid or someone to die .
i take my job seriously when it comes to safety in the water because i do n't want to ever have to do cpr when it comes to lifeguards tho if you have to do cpr you probably failed your job to begin with because there should never be a victim who drowned .
so for this issue i would propose the following .
better pails have a higher chance to drop more .
the major issue in this game is events and exploration .
so the theory probably is that they expected you to explore the ash heap and doing the events and encounter the hunters along the way .
the other issue of this event is the loot pool .
if were supposed to get access to this loot pool once a month ... then they do n't want you to get all the items in one go .
they want to give future events value to players to care for .
for all we know 30 or 40 of the player base could not care less about the rewards .
maybe on the last world you played on a player s got 10 ornate pails that they would have sold for 3 or 2k caps .
maybe someone got the plan twice and wanted to sell it for 1k caps .
we have no idea how the player economy wouldve impacted this event .
in a perfect world fir me each time a temp event uses this pool they add one or two new recipes .
and the monsters that drop or have a 20 or 50 chance to spawn at the end of events .
and only a 20 or 50 chance to spawn inside of locations if you 're in a party with one other person inside the instance .
they rushed this out because they wanted to give the large influx of players from wastelanders something new .
fuck job creation lets give more money to the government they 've proven to be fiscally responsible .

i would have but my company just cut our salaries by 15

i not let my mama walk down there alone and she blacker than night .
i show you safer route where no one bother you . ''
an area that i as a white woman felt unsafe in was an area that the black security guard also thought was unsafe .
and yet there are areas where i 'd feel fine but he would be uneasy .
and this is the uk where racial tensions are not as ... pronounced as they are in the us .

idk about chacos but i have 2 pairs of birkenstock 's .
the mayari style i just wear everywhere extremely comfortable they both are but i do find my feet will begin to hurt only if i am walking for an extended amount of time not just standing but actually moving because i have to grip the shoe ya know ?
which is why i also have the rio style they have a back strap so the support needed to not have to grip the shoe with my foot i wear them for long walks/easy hikes pretty much anytime i 'll be doing a lot of walking .
100 bucks a pair but 100 hands down the most comfortable shoes i have ever owned in my life other than my uggs but that 's a different kind of ‘snuggly ' comfort haha

no no you 're fine sometimes it 's hard to determine what 's grammatically correct because for example if something reaches common-use does that mean it 's grammatically correct even if it lowers clarity or whatever you 're after with regards to grammar in the first place ?
using either 'they ' or 'them ' can itself be awkward or unclear because you 're using a plural to refer to a singular which might potentially lead to confusion whereas simply either 'he ' or 'she ' while not as exhaustive or fully inclusive '' as some want communicates the singular very clearly the gender/sex is simply hypothetical for the example if you 're not referring to a specific character/person with a specific gender or w/e .
of course this very clearly demonstrates the utility of a genderless uh ... .pronoun ?

i played the entirety of return of the obra dinn without realizing that ! the seamen all have assigned hammocks that match their number on the ledger ! or ! the midshipmen all wear the same outfits as each other along with all the stewards !
which is why easily half of the solved identities for me were either best guesses or using the groups of three '' verification system to guess-and-check
identifying the four seamen from the same country whose names were never spoken aloud was literally impossible the way i played and i thought guessing-and-checking was the intended solution

nah that 's the best solution really they clearly do n't care much at all about the fish and would probably be happy not to have to give it whatever minimal care they were .
only thing is i 'd just give it to a pond store or a friend 's pond and then tell the friend the tank cracked and killed the fish so they do n't try to get another

i agree 100 ... taking a step back and thinking of when there was a shift in where they were searching when they became tight lipped and the family went wayyyy more silent does put it into perspective more .
this is definitely a good reminder to step back and realize we have more info than we think we do just by how it 's being handled .
also they switch the directions or the button presses between rounds which throws me off
still seems like this team probably does n't have the defense to contain an offense with mj barkley magic etc .
they 're probably still killer on offense but it 's a legit question how they would stop other worldly offensive players on that 92 team .

mmos are incredibly hard to balance they live and die on players engagement and player count .
and they are not everyone 's cup of tea .
also you will need some studio to really make it their flagship with expansion and big content patches .
i ca n't picture how raids will function in the op universe either .
mmos require a lot of commitment and in the end of the day you 'd be fighting for players with wow ff14 eso and the like .
like moose said normally i 'm on top of this argument too but i do n't know here .
for the normal standard cards i agree and for the commander cards i definitely agree .
the godzilla cards i do n't know while maybe not expecting to crash overnight normally there is a small subtle gradual decline over days or weeks but nothing is indicating that here .
pretty much all the cards are holding strong and many of the mythics are still moving upward .
i think this set and this group of cards is going to be a weird exception to the general timing rules of when to buy/sell .
along with all the unique situations like the store constraints w' covid and such i think there may be a big underestimation on the brand of the godzilla ip and ca n't exactly be compared to in the same light as the theros god stargazing art or the eldraine storybook art .

it 's on even when the radio is turned off and when the ac is off .
as long as my car is on that noise keeps clicking .
i do not have any cd 's so i do n't think it 's a cd .
i had this problem a couple months ago and it stopped but and only did it right when i turned my car on .
but now even 20 minutes into a drive it still makes that obnoxious clicking noise .

music performance spaces have much longer isd than small listening room .
one way to trick your brain is to absorb the early reflections so that you hear the initial reflections from the recording first followed by diffuse reflections from your rear wall .
and to preserve those reflections you basically just need to knock down the reflective sound by 10db after the direct sound within 15ms .
these reflections can cause image shifting and ruin your sound stage .
here 's where we need acoustic treatment to create your rfz
the european broadcasting union ebu and telecommunications union itu recommend that you treat reflections earlier than 15 ms relative to the direct sound .
your goal is to tame these early reflection levels so they are at least 10 db below the direct sound for all frequencies in the range 1 khz to 8 khz .
sound travels about 17 feet in 15 ms where the speed of sound is 1125 feet per second .
this means before reaching your ears you want the first reflections to travel at least 17 feet further than the direct sound .
otherwise you 've got to treat them so they 're at least 10 db below the direct sound .
i remember when i used to debate this with norouter/localhost i 'm sure you 've seen him here and on other forums .
he 's a room treatment absolutist i would show him my measurements but the only measurement that counted with him was impulse response .
he laughed at when i would just show him raw fr or waterfall and basically say show me the time domain ! ''
when i posted the above he promptly left the debate .
aside from those 3 peaks that near 15 db i 'm basically at control room levels here .
actually i recommend you aim for at least 15 db for hi-fi rooms and 20 db for control mastering rooms
if you 're a fan of wide dispersion '' then hard flooring is the only option .
how would floor bounce contribute to wide dispersion ? ''
wide dispersion is used to increase the soundstage 's lateral size and floor bounce and reflections are often detrimental to timbre .
i 've looked into this when you made the hardwood floor recommendation before and the primary reason studios or prosumers use it is because it 's easier to slide gear and chairs around on it .
hardwood flooring is more recommended for the actual recording of live instruments .
and this debate just goes into obscurantist circles https www.gearslutz.com/board/studio-building-acoustics/596373-flooring-question-4.html

nannies and au pairs are super different and come with different commitments and costs .

i saw an article the other day bemoaning philanthropy from billionaires like it is some major ilk and saying it is to avoid taxes and look good to the public .
at least a good portion of such things are actually going to solving problems .
like bezos is dropping millions into homeless solutions around the country .
like how many billions in taxes would it take and how many years for the government to do that ?
and everyone was on bill gates dick about his malaria nets and other projects .
how would the government have handled these funds and projects ?
probably giving the contract to a friend for some financial donation to their campaign and then leaving the nets in some warehouse .
i would consider my family somewhat philanthropic or at least willing to help our neighbors .
we collect and give away supplies to people in need or work to hook them up with connections .
and i would rather give the guy on the corner 10 cash than pay it to the government to give him 5 in limited buying power .

i am new to ctfs and i was trying some binary exploits on picoctf .
handy-shellcode i got the flag with this exploit python2 c 'print x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80 '' ' cat ./vuln. shellcode from shellstorm .
but when i run the exploit without the cat it just runs and stops without printing the flag .
how is the program able to read the flag.txt file before setting the gid ?
would the program still work if we removed the getegid and setresgid lines ?
i tried making a copy of the program without these lines and compiling/running it on the server but was having some permissions problems .
every time entering or leaving a room there can be 3 4 seconds of wait time for my download version .

chicken as a something to eat is ubiquitously terrible .
there is no version of it that tastes remotely good .
the most popular type fried chicken is just too cumbersome to eat and has a disgusting texture .
chicken with a bunch of sauce like general tso 's is decent at first but terrible once you get past the sauce .
rotisserie chicken is slimy along with the nasty skin feeling off .
finally chicken in its most basic form when just cooked chicken breast put in the oven in a pan or something is the most godawful of all of them due to its terrible taste and string ones .
i enjoy eating other types of meat i just can not stand chicken .
besides shrimp chips it is in the running for the worst food on the planet .
i was wondering if anyone has had paranormal encounters with deceased family members within your home or apartment .
most specifically hearing their voices randomly showing up in the room out of the corner of your eye for a split second or showing up in the middle of the night when you are trying to sleep .
we have several what we believe to be family members who pop up at different times in our home .
i have seen them from time to time out of the corner of my eye sitting in corners and my family has woken up to one of our family members standing over the bed watching them sleep .
it is always a split second thing and i question what i have seen every time so i end up not having time to be afraid .
for a while every night at a certain time there would be a door slam and stomping that went from one side of the house to the other and then another door slam .
this faded away after we put away certain items that belonged to a family member who we later attributed the stomping to .
it is bizarre and while the activity has gone down to a strange occurrence once or twice a year that is still a lot for that most people do n't see anything at all ever .
i have no idea why they continue to hang around here or what triggered them in the first place .
any one on twiitter know the backstory to what 's going on ?
this might be a pretty long story but it needs to be heard .
so it started with creating a new account thinking wow i can actually order publix 's subs how awesome '' .
i placed a order with the total of 45 and hours later i was contacted by the shopper heather v telling me my card did n't work sorry '' .
in confusion i called customer service that is located in columbia and was told by andres h the shopper spent too much on the card provided by the company .
i was confused because i was already charged a authorization charge of 50 .
he tried to breakdown exactly what happened and managed to make no sense at all .
he informed me he could give me a new shopper and promised i would receive it by 9:00pm est .
i was then assigned a new shopper allen f after about 30 min he send me a message telling me i 'm 40 min away from the store and might not make it before i closes .
i do n't understand why they do this. '' .
i then called customer service again and the lady was such a bitch i asked to speak with a supervisor and she literally said no '' and i can only give you 5 credit '' i had to hang up her attitude was disgusting .
i called again and the lady asked how i was doing and i said absolutely terrible '' at which then she gave no recollection or sympathy to my statement i had to hang up .
i finally reached a supervisor who was n't able to help me as much as i would like .
he told me i ca n't guarantee you will get it today but i 'll try '' i had to remind him the store was closed.. like what ? ! ..
every single person i spoke with sounded half asleep did n't give a shit and did n't listen to me the 2nd driver was great and felt super bad for him and i 'm sorry that i missing so much to this story but this was literally the worst first impression of any business i ever used before .
maybe they should n't out source their customer service and they could have a quality experience and not be cheap with it .
i mean they have already had a large class action lawsuit by the drivers and i would n't be surprised if another one happens filed by customers .
i hope no one else has had this type of service before and let 's not forget to mention how fucking glitchy the site is with the status of the orders .
makes me want to slap the them who developed it .
you can call me a karen but i 'm sure any person would be absolutely frustrated with this type of service .
took 3 hours and 6 calls to just get my ordered canceled and a sincere apology .
i 'm looking to start reviewing people 's youtube channels in a more serious way than i have seen on here .
i want to get a script down for a content review pretty soon .
i 'd eventually like to critique larger youtubers as well as the smaller guy .
i think it would be cool if there were a rotten tomatoes-style channel that reviewed people 's content and acted as a social pressure to keep people on their toes and promote competition .
i am a film major and have been editing for around 7 years now so i think i could be qualified enough to do so .
i was wanting to start off by reviewing smaller channels and give them some feedback .
it 's one thing to be shallow and say some shit like i find his content funny '' or he does n't edit well '' but i think serious and thoughtful critique of casual internet content could be good for the site .
i also think it could be fun to add some humor in there somewhere to keep the reviews less intense .
link ur channels below and i 'll add them to my list .
i am more likely to review a channel that is more fleshed out with a decent amount of uploads .
i 'd probably randomly pick a video and analyze it bit by bit .
just be aware i would be reviewing people 's content objectively for the most part and might not always have positive things to say ...
i think one of my friends is hiding their true selves behind a persona whenever we hang out how can i let them know it 's ok to be themselves around me ?
i try to do a lot of things to spice up someones shitty composition usually try to run different instruments or stems through grossbeat and with certain fx 's usually acting as a riser to another drop .
another one could be side chaining the hats to a certain fx and setting an automated envelope on it.. really digging for ideas to keep some of these mediocre mixes sounding fresh .
any more you could come up with to make an average song sound half-decent i am all ears .

does anyone know if the base set with resin figures instead of pvc ones will become available again ?
here are some notes i have on new or additional content or changes and mechanics for bosses or strikes/nf that i would like to see on d2
1 make a new strike or raid encounter where you ca n't do damage you just need to survive without killing anyone .
a couple of missions on d1 and d2 tapped on this idea sort of but it was pretty easy to escape .
in this case escaping is not an option you have to survive without killing .
2 another idea is to have a boss that is immune to certain weapons not types of damage per round .
like on a round only those with hand cannons can do damage and so .
that would require a team that 's equipped with all types of weapons and would push for more weapon diversity on a raid .
3 bring back sneaking encounters where you have to avoid getting seen like the gorgon 's lair on the vault of glass and the bridge on crota 's raid .
4 bring back lore for types of enemies and introduce more unique enemies .
similar to what was introduced in the house of wolves expansion where you had a grimoire entry per enemy you killed and the more you killed you got some buffs .
for example i really enjoy card games that introduce crazy ways to play for each season like gwent .
do n't be afraid to experiment and let people loose .
one idea is to let everyone equip more than one exotic for a particular crucible mode .
or introduce a mode like team deathmatch but with vex or hive enemies attacking every now and then .
6 make sparrow racing league weekly tournaments and tiers .
you already have everything set up for it just leave it on for good .
7 allow us to get purchase bounties from the app or in orbit .
i 've had several issues with the tower where some vendors do n't spawn .
8 make special types of enemies that randomly spawn on any content you 're playing and drop special loot like emblems shaders etc .
that 's the first batch of notes i have .
let me know what you think and please feel free to comment on any ideas you may have .
let me know what you 're looking for in return !

so i 've been having some issues with what i think it 's my gpu .
sometimes when i start my pc gpu fan speed goes up to 100 and the gpu temperature readings are 0ºc .
if i 'm playing any game i have to adjust the fan speed manually at around 60 with msi afterburner and for some time it was running ok until now when the gpu randomly puts up the fan speed to 100 bypassing afterburner i get a black screen and the fans keep on 100 until i manually turn off the computer .
while i 'm watching tv shows or browsing this does n't happen it 's only while gaming .
latest amd drivers are installed and everything except the bios is up to date .
i have n't updated the bios cause i 'm aware the psu could be the issue and i do n't wan na risk bricking my mobo .
some other times the system reads the gpu temperature but soon after it surpasses 60ºc it goes back to 0 and fans at 100 speed .
maybe it needs thermal paste i have n't changed this in almost 5 years ?
tl dr system shows gpu temp at 0ºc start a game after 5 mins black screen gpu fans at 100 speed and i 've to shut everything down .
when system reads gpu temp it stops reading it after 60ºc or so .

my last pc finally died after years of what i 'm assuming is heat related damage a while back and i 'm finally financially ready to build a new hopefully better rig and start over .
i like to think i 've done my research and this build will work great but i always want advice especially with airflow since i know air cooling and watercooling have there pros and cons my plan is 8 fans in front pulling and 8 fans spread from the back to the top in push but i had a hard time finding anything compatible with this build that is n't a custom loop so this is what i have so far .
i would also like to know if i 'll need any extra specific cables/extenders since those can be tricky to research and are sometimes build specific but anyways this is it
i appreciate any help or advice on what i need or am neglecting before i start hopefully purchasing parts in the coming days so thank you so much in advance .
also i 'm a caveman at formatting so i apologize for my neolithic layout and punctuation .
i recently bought three new ceiling fans with built in lights for three bedrooms .
the third one will turn on fine but then within a minute it 's like the power blips and it shuts off then turns right back on .
i do n't think it 's the circuit because when it blips nothing else on the circuit blips .
i noticed it with the fan and lights on but it will do it with just the lights on .
i took it apart to check the wiring and everything looked connected but i took off the wire connectors and put them back on again to be sure .
this model came with a remote so there is a receiver resting inside the unit .
i do n't think im over powering the circuit because it 's just this and even with just the lights .
it 's not the remote because i took the batteries out and it still behaved this way .
i do n't think it 's interference because it happens too frequently and is just a very quick blip .
since i was pretty sure it was n't my wiring i was thinking maybe a faulty receiver but now here 's the bonus weird part .
i first noticed it with the light and fan on that i said the lights blink and i heard the fan stop then start again .
and i said that i tried with just the light and it also blinked off and on .
but so far when i 've run it with just the fan it seems to be fine .
the light housing piece has a wiring harness that literally just clips into place so i did n't think i could mess that up but i unclipped it and clipped it again and still the same behavior .
i think i should contact manufacturer at this point because my guess is something faulty related to the internals of the light .
the wires appear to look fine but i 'm not an electrical engineer so who knows .
is there anything else you can think of for troubleshooting especially to make sure it 's not me ? ?
edit the light housing piece is n't completely separate from the fan as the switch to change the fan 's direction is on that part .
let 's say that you could have any solo series featuring an x character get greenlit tomorrow .
allison blair uses her fame as krakoa 's first celebrity as a cover for investigating mutant related incidents around the world .
we 'd get to see her globe trotting performing and solving a mystery or two .
the supporting cast would include her marketing guru and manager lacuna of x-statix her not-to-be-trusted sister mortis and her bodyguard strong guy .
this would have a very empowering and very optimistic tone overall .
daken returns to madripoor to help tyger tiger against a slow moving hostile takeover from bagalia .
tiger knows that daken is willing to do the things that even his father wo n't do to stop the villains from bagalia .
the supporting cast would include tyger tiger the wisecracking dirtnap who is still stuck as a rat and still useless in any capacity other than a spy for daken the mercenary razor fist who daken constantly harasses and inflicts pain on until he is forced to spy on bagalia for daken his is a very comedic role and gomurr the ancient who was deposed as proctor of the crimson dawn and sent back to earth where he started peddling his mystical wares and magical scams in madripoor a short while ago and seems hellbent on inserting himself into daken 's adventures .
the tone of this book is a slightly darker seedier sexier version of deadpool .
i have mats i just need someone to craft it name your price in bells or nmt !
i 'm in my mid-twenties and needless to say this is way out of my wheelhouse so ... thanks for bearing with me in advance .
my partner and i have been together for close to 7 years .
love him to death so getting out of this is n't an option because i do n't want to .
his parents moved in with us about three-ish years ago .
his parents are significantly older than mine because he 's the baby of his family .
they are both unique people but we love them and they are very good people at heart despite our interpersonal gripes here and there .
if it was just those gripes it would be one thing .
but compounding his stepmother 's increasing bladder incontinence on top of it is making life under quarantine very stressful for partner and i .
she is of sound mind sometimes she 's a little kooky but really a nice person who would do anything for her 'stepson ' she 's never actually been married to his dad she was just a friend of his that became a roommate of 30 years .
she is able to do her desk job just fine and she really is a great person she 's overweight all of us in the house are but she is older and is pretty out of shape to the point that she can not bring groceries into the house and she gets winded doing just about anything stairs are one at a time and she has to go down them backwards .
getting to and from the bathroom she comes back out of breath .
i believe her incontinence is specifically the result of a bad hysterectomy or maybe it just commonly happens with them and it 's made worse by the obesity .
the incontinence and incidences of wetting seem to have gotten worse over the last few years that they have been living with us .
she acknowledges that she leaks and words it that delicately every time .
i know she has nighttime wetting because i 've seen her bare mattress before just passing by her bedroom .
but there have been a few times that her entire backside will be entirely soaked going all the way down her leg .
she has kind of just gone about her day i 'm sure she notices though because she changes every time she wets .
i have n't said anything a single time i 've seen a wet spot on her clothes .
she fairly frequently gets up and leaves wet spots on our furniture so lately i 've been scrambling to put down towels when i hear her coming downstairs into our living space .
i do n't want to make her feel unwelcome at all i just really want to preserve our furniture and not have it all smell like pee ...
partner stepmom-in law and i all work for the same company and have been extremely fortunate to be able to work from home .
she and i work the am shift at the same time then partner works the nights and has to share a chair and workstation with her .
i notice a really strong odor a lot during the day pretty much every day .
it ranges from fishy to extremely ammonia smell and it is on the chair every time she gets up .
i worry that she does n't wipe herself because i have gone in after her and found a brown butt print on the seat so if she 's only washing herself in the shower daily or every other day i worry it 's a risk of infection ?
the odor on the chair usually persists even after febreze and ozium on the chair .
she is really emotionally volatile even before her incontinence issues became more severe .
i do n't know that talking to her about it is an option .
she had pneumonia a few years ago and was coughing a lot understandably but she could n't smell and was leaking pretty constantly and the entire upstairs smelled very very strongly of urine to the point that it was giving me a headache .
partner telling her that the smell was overwhelming and that we needed her to wear her incontinence pads and clean her clothes in pretty much those words from what he told me just made her cry ... and then nothing changed .
i know that anyone would cry about getting confronted with something like that i 'm just as sensitive to being criticized about almost anything .
so i understand her emotional turmoil i promise i do i just want to figure out how to broach this with her sensitively .
my ultimate goal is to treat her with as much dignity as possible but also maintain sanitary living conditions for all four of us .
i 'm embarrassed to have people over because of the smell and this has really hamstrung a lot of our plans for the future which i know sounds dramatic but she leaves urine spots pretty much everywhere she sits whether it 's our couches or the office chair .
i guess i have a few questions so thanks for reading this far
does anyone in this situation have advice on how to broach this with her ?
is talking to her about it even the right option at this stage ?
i do n't know what the right answer is with someone who knows but is clearly not managing it well .
what cleaners are the preferred choice for removing smell ?
she kind of just uses whatever detergent is there but has psoriasis so needs a sensitive detergent and i do n't want to sneak in and add stuff to her laundry to prevent it all from smelling .
is cleaning afterward the best solution or are there proactive approaches i can take ?
i 'd like to be able to come home from work and not have to worry about chasing down whatever smells in the house whether it 's laundry she left in the washing machine that has to be re-washed or a couch she sat on .
sometimes it 's a toilet she did n't flush so if there are automatic flushers that can be installed in a rental is that a possibility ? ?
sometimes it feels like dealing with someone who has like ... half dementia but maybe that 's just her being inconsiderate ?
i 'm genuinely not sure and we ca n't bring it up with her
i am pretty skilled at sewing and i was thinking of rigging something up for our furniture with puppy pads underneath that we can pull up and replace is that an option or are there absorbent couch covers that actually work ?
i tried to poke around for absorbent fabrics but nothing stellar came up and cloth diaper fabrics are a little obvious and ugly frankly haha .
i really hope my choice of language has been sensitive .
since most people here deal with this on a personal level feel free to roast me or tell me to stop being shitty if i 've said anything horrible or out of turn .
i do n't want to come off as self-centered or ableist .
i really really apologize if anything i 've said is n't sensitive .
does anyone have a reliable canning recipe for a stir-fry sauce similar to general tso 's ?

i 've bitten my nails for all the 21 years of my life and i 've just managed to stop in the last three months .
my nails are incredibly weak and bendy i 'm worried that i might loose all my progress and end up doing back to my old ways .
i ca n't really afford to get my nails professionally done on a regular basis so i 've been looking into trying gel nails at home .
i 've found the gel bottle inc but they only sell to professionals .
do any of you know if there 's a way to get around this on their website ?
or do you know another gel brand that are good and affordable and that deliver to the uk ?

i want to come back at the game and want to know if the game is still active on xbox ?
i decided to quit yesterday and so far so good .
first time is going by a lot slower and i 'm more thoughtful .
however i feel quite conscious of brain fog that 's the second thing .
i 'm realizing for the first time that this fog is one of the things that makes me crave a high because the sober fog is inferior to the high haze .
i 'm curious if this last part resonates with anyone ?
i 'm trying to understand the money shot skill for salvador .

i 've only just discovered it but the warriors has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time .
from the minute i saw the wonder wheel paired with the surreal and synth heavy soundtrack in the background i was hooked .
the entire movie has a dreamlike feel to it with the movie taking place largely at night the dystopian setting with the city almost entirely consisting of gangs or police .
it reminds me of mad max in some ways with the entire movie being a chase much like fury road .
there is a lot of world building as well without giving too much away .
for example the radiowomen luther talking on the phone with the enigmatic boss '' the city being almost void of firearms or the baseball furie 's creepy mutism .
you ca n't help but wonder how this world came to be with the gangs committing so heavily to their identities a heavily armored bus roaming the streets or a messiah-like figure trying to spark a revolution .
the acting and fight scenes can be cheesey at times sure .
but the movie manages to keep it 's tone consistent .
while the film may not have much to say one scene stands out to me the ride home with swan and mercy .
for those that have n't seen the movie spoiler warning .
the scene with swan stopping mercy from fixing her hair in front of the prom kids was really powerful to me .
they inhabit the same city yet are worlds apart from each other .
the prom kids have no idea the warrior 's night thus far has been nothing but violence death and destruction .
i think swan and mercy never wanted the lives they were given it 's why swan takes a liking to her he could see through the facade she was putting up and could relate .
the only difference is their approach mercy puts on a show but deep down wants nothing more than to escape .
swan has long given up and decides to embrace it and believes there is merit in their way of life .
perhaps swan even sees mercy as a spark of hope to someday escape as well but for the time being he has no choice but to live with the hand he was given and protect his fellow soldiers .
this movie oozes style and has some of the most unique and iconic imagery i 've ever seen in a film .
are there any aussie guys located in melbourne that i can ask a few questions to ?

i watch a lot of tv but no series right now a lot of north woods law though favorite of all time is stargate sg1 .
i like anime too but again not watching any right now .
i dont really listen to music all that much but if i do its reliant k or cartel and stuff like that .
your sexuality does n't matter but its something id like to talk about .
i also would like someone my age or a bit younger idk why but i always view older guys as adults '' and it makes me nervous to try and talk to them .
i cant bring myself to share my deeper thoughts with women it always feels like they dont understand or cant relate ... .theres probably a reason for that which i dont really want to get into .
i am also pretty bad at understanding my own emotons ... but thats something im working on .
if someone who has been going to the gym for a while has some tips and such that would be cool too ... .. once they open back up .
i was going for a bit and was doing well then went on vacation and the screwed it up and i wasnt able to actually make progress after that and gained all the weight i lost back .
if youre interested send me a message or chat .
if you have discord or kik thats so much better than here .
i also have trouble starting conversations for the most part or i go into too intimate of stuff too quick .
the more open minded and go with the flow type of guy the better ... . i always end up feeling judged .
i already have seasons 1-3 in snap case form .
i lost the love of my life 5 years ago .
but she never gave up not until her very last moments .
she never lost hope she smiled through the pain even when i could n't get up could n't bear to see her like that .
up until a few weeks ago i remained living in the cottage house we had bought together .
i felt i could n't abandon it it would betray her .
she had put so much care into every single detail from the flowers on our bedroom 's wallpaper to the fairy lights hanging above the terrace .
she adored our home called it our little hobbit-hole to honor our shared passion for the lord of the rings .
she even insisted on painting the front door forest green !
to my deepest despair i recently had to let go of it and sell it in a hurry .
i got promoted at the company i work for but my new position required me to move a few states away and i could n't miss that opportunity .
and even if i hate to admit it a part of me was tired of living in the past and needed a fresh start .
i kept as much furniture that the truck could fit that way a little part of her was still coming with me .
besides i think that is what she would have wanted me to do to keep moving to be successful and to make the most out of the rest of my life as cliché as that might sound .
i found my new house very quickly at a suspiciously low price for its size location and backyard space surrounded by beautiful woods .
when the owner told me the previous tenant drowned in the pool and his body was found only a few days later i understood .
i should have said no to the offer and never looked back .
i arrived here about 4 months ago and got everything in place .
even filled with my things the inside still looked dull anna had a real talent for decorating .
i put our wedding photos above the fireplace along with a framed letter she had written me when we first met .
in my bedroom i hung my favorite portrait of her standing in the lake near our home laughing her azure eyes shining and her long blonde hair dripping wet .
maybe she even would have liked it here with the forest around .
so a few nights after i finished settling in the new place i got in the backyard after dinner and sat in the lounge chair with a cold beer to celebrate .
the weather was perfect and the stars were visible away from the city .
after a while my eyes fell upon the now empty pool .
the landlord told me it could n't be fixed after the incident and that he would have it removed soon .
i was n't planning on using it anyway but it got me thinking about the old tenant .
apparently he was a loner and his boss decided to go check on him after he did n't come into work for a few days .
the only person that truly cared about me was gone .
i could n't control myself anymore and started crying .
i must have dozed off then because i had the strangest dream or so i thought at the time .
in it the pool was full of water again emanating a soft glow and casting turquoise shadows on the house facade .
in the same bathing suit she was wearing in that picture at the lake sitting at the egde of the pool swinging her legs back and forth .
she raised her head and as her gaze met mine her face lit up in a smile .
she reached out her hand and i could move again .
i got up in a daze and jumped in next to her .
and i woke up still in the lounge chair my neck hurting like hell .
at first i did n't make anything of it .
it was far from the first time i had dreamt of anna .
but as i slowly regained my senses i felt cold and i realized i was soaking wet .
the pool was completely empty plus i could n't have walked in and out without waking up .
i looked at my watch it read 3 00 am .
i had been sleeping outside for more than 5 hours !
back then i still found a rational explanation to my experience .
exhausted i went back inside and crashed on my bed without noticing that the grass and the trees in the backyard were as dry as they could be .
the next few weeks nothing really out of the ordinary happened .
a construction crew came in to do the pool demolition so i steered clear of the backyard .
t 's when the crew left that everything changed .
the first night it happened i was exhausted and fell asleep quickly in my bedroom as usual .
i found myself in the backyard except something was different .
the pool was there again full bluest waters shining as ever under the porch light light waves crashing on the sides .
and anna was standing in the middle of it in that bathing suit she liked so much .
her arms were open as if to invite me in .
it 's so great in here i think i 'm never getting out !
she splashed me and laughed the notes echoing in the night .
i do n't know why but i felt something was wrong .
her skin was too pale or her eyes too bright or her teeth too sharp or her hair too long or her smile too big ...
i could n't pinpoint it but my gut was telling me to run .
« no anna you 're gon na get so cold ... just come out and we can go inside please baby ? » i answered groggily .
i swear at that moment i saw her expression change .
it 's like a dark veil covered her features for a split second before returning to her normal happy self .
» she asked in a mocking tone cocking her head .
« if you join me we can be together forever .
you never have to feel guilty or miserable ever again .
at that moment i knew that was n't anna .
she would want me to be as happy as i can be alive even if it was n't with her .
« i 'm sorry but i really ca n't .
her smile dropped and turned into a frown her jaw tightening .
anna could have never looked like that no matter how much she would”ve tried .
there was no way in hell that this was her .
i was n't just afraid anymore i was terrified .
« oh honey do n't make me do this ... » she said every word dripping with venom .
« this is just a dream i created it i can wake up.» i repeated in my mind .
it only gave her a few seconds before i forced my eyes to shoot open .
i was standing in the backyard on the newly patched-up lawn .
the next few weeks i kept having this horrible nightmare .
except every night it was getting harder to wake up and anna would swim closer and closer .
i always ended up in the backyard and it was n't just something i could explain with sleepwalking induced by anxiety or stress from the move .
it started affecting my daily life i could n't fall back asleep after the dreams .
like something was trying to mimic her but it was n't human enough to get it right .
she was behind me when i looked in the mirror her figure stood out in the shadows i even saw her with the characters in the movies i watched to distract myself .
i felt like i was going insane and i was terribly alone .
i could n't keep up at work i was almost always late and i came close to losing the promotion .
i even tried staying awake but it never worked .
i would always doze off no matter how much caffeine i ingested or how loud i would play music .
one night i drifted into feverish sleep again but this time the dream changed .
this time anna started swimming towards me but she dived underwater .
the water was so clear i would have seen her even if she went so deep as to touch the bottom .
right at the edge of the pool a few inches from me .
she shot up her arm at an ungodly speed and grabbed my wrist .
her hand was a sickly green and her nails rotting black long and broken like those of a drowned corpse .
she yanked on my arm and i fell on my knees .
in my mind i was screaming at myself to wake up or i would die .
a second more and i would have fallen in but i regained my strength all at once and as hard as i could i pulled my arm back .
it must have startled her because she loosened her grip and i stumbled back away from the pool .
i was lying on the ground covered in dirt .
in the middle of the night i threw random clothes into a bag took my car keys and sped off towards the highway .
after an hour of driving my heartbeat slowed down a bit and i came across a little motel on the side of the road .
i checked in and was assigned a small dusty room with mismatched furniture and a worn yellow carpet .
even if the flowered comforter had cigarette burns and the sheets smelled like perfume that was n't mine i felt safer than i had in weeks .
i watched late night news and for the first time her face did n't merge with the presenter 's .
as a car commercial was playing i felt my eyes growing heavier until i could n't keep them open .
i cried tears of joy when i woke up .
i felt so relieved and i really thought everything was over .
i stayed at that motel for two months even if i had to get up in the early morning hours so i could arrive to work on time .
and eventually i started to think that all of it had really been in my head .
that it was my subconscious blaming myself for leaving anna our home and our memories in the past .
i mean a creature that took my dead wife 's appearance to lure me ?
and one day i received a call from my landlord because he wanted to swing by the house because he needed me to sign a form he had forgotten .
his voice sounded somewhat strange on the phone but i chalked it up to my imagination .
after a bit of hesitation i decided that i was ready to move back in .
i drove up to the house after work that evening ready for a new start .
as i was walking up to the deck stairs i felt old anxieties surge up and my chest tighten .
» i unlocked the front door and got in .
i turned on the lights of the familiar hallway and walked to the kitchen .
as i was pouring myself a glass of water i felt the hair in the back of my neck stand up like someone was behind me .
i turned around almost laughing at myself it was obviously nothing .
but something caught my eye just out the sliding glass door .
i felt the blood drain from my body as the cup i was holding shattered on the floor .
my eyes widened and my mouth opened in a silent scream so deafening that i only could only in my mind .
an immense force one i could never resist was pulling me towards that fucking pool .
i could n't blink i could n't move i could n't run i could just watch myself slide open the door and walk into the backyard stopping right before the water .
it 's like all the lights had been sucked from existence .
i could still feel the water around me but everything else was gone .
i was floating in an infinite sea of black .
there was no way of getting out of here .
i would die in this abyss and no one would find my body .
every second that passed my brain pleaded louder for oxygen .
and with all hope lost i accepted my fate .
i stopped trying to swim up and let myself sink deeper and deeper .
but as i was about to pass out i felt someone take my hand and ever so slowly pull me up .
her real voice not the one from my dreams .
you 're so strong i know you can keep fighting .
i love you so much baby but please please do n't give up .
» dazed i found the strength to open my eyes again and she was there with me .
her golden hair illuminating the darkness around us her smile so warm and gentle .
she motioned for me to look up and i finally saw it .
i could see the night sky in my backyard .
in desperation despite my lungs burning and sending sharp bolts of pain through my nerves i started flailing my arms and legs .
with the help of anna i started ascending back to my world .
until i felt a sharp tug on my foot .
broken nails sunk deep into my flesh and i let out a muffled shriek .
underneath me was a twisted creature with the torso of a woman and the tail of a fish .
her pale skin was covered in open wounds algae growing from each putrid gash .
brown oozing seashells clung to her bloated exposed breasts .
she was completely bald blue veins pulsing under her scalp .
her bulging eyes were a cloudy white devoid of any pupil taking up half of her face .
she did n't have a nose only two slits where her nostrils should have been .
i could spot a set of fins down on her thin neck but her mouth was the worst of all .
it was a gaping hole with countless rows of tiny deadly fangs protruding from ruined gums .
her fish tail was lined with dull grew scales and jagged fins .
and this abomination was bringing me back down in that sunken place .
i tried to pull my foot out of her grip but it was so tight .
i tried kicking her with my other leg but the blows did n't have any effect .
but as the monster was dragging me lower and lower i realized i could n't feel her grip anymore .
and i heard anna 's voice again « go go nick !
i can keep her away but not for long !
» a wave of electricity rushed through my body and jolted me up .
i looked underneath me to see anna strangling the creature despite the fangs cutting through her arms a torrent of blood oozing from the bites .
my wife nodded at me through the pain and i screamed a last « i love you !
with new energy i swam as fast as i could towards the night sky .
i slumped over the pool 's edge and coughed up a gallon of water gasping for air .
i took long raspy breaths and laid in the grass looking at the stars .
after what felt like an eternity i got up and walked inside .
sitting at my desk writing this story in the dim light of my computer screen .
i do n't know if anyone will believe me but i have to try .
when i am done i am burning this house to the ground with me inside .
i know wherever i go this creature will follow me .
there is no way that i can ever escape her .
but i know that if this house is gone there are less chances that anyone else will come to feed her and fall into her claws .
god knows how many souls she has claimed besides the man living here before me .
and i implore you if you see any attempt of rebuilding property after the fire at 39 westland street bangor maine please do anything in your power to stop it .
so i know for a fact that this community is relatively old and i 'm just getting into this game .
i 'm sure these have been asked a 1,000 times and there 's some controversy around the class so i apologize beforehand .
how do i call out to teammates so they know i 'm trying to actually do my job and get that sweet sweet speed boost ?
does it only work for squadmates or can i save more people much easier ?
i know it 's really situational and a personal preference but should i stick with my type 100 or consider moving on to another weapon ?
not a question but something i learned that makes me laugh smoke pisses off enemy tanks .
in fact i like to annoy them and run circles around them while my assaults line up at shots .
i 'm not good at fps but i 'm learning and improving as i go but so far for only 2 dozen hours i 've managed to revive nearly 2k people iirc so got that part down .

any tips anyone would be willing to share on that end ?
recently i got a robomaster ep a educational robot featuring tcp api with live video/audio streaming .
that 's to say it is programable from your pc .
after some diging in opencv and math i made my new pal a goalkeeper .
he is not a very good one but works ok.
i use opencv to detect and mark the ball 's position and radius caculate distance with some geometry and pinhole camera model and control the lateral speed of my goalkeeper with a pid libary .
i also made a client and framework for robomaster ep robermasterpy which is available on pip https github.com/nanmu42/robomasterpy https github.com/nanmu42/robomasterpy
a star would be apreciated if you feel like them .
i am tourist and woukd perhaps want to cross the border between montenegro and croatia .
just a few days ago i shared with you all my side-project wrong project .
today just a few days after i 'm happy to share that we decided to launch on product hunt https www.producthunt.com/posts/wrong-project !
wrong project is a publication for short to the point opinion pieces from top creators all over the world .
let 's be honest — the number of articles in our read later list that we 're never going to get around to reading is getting a little out of hand .
all of our writers ' pieces are less than 200 words so you 'll have time to read them while the information is still relevant .
our select community of writers includes a quickly rising musical entrepreneur to a forbes 30 under 30 designer a world-renowned social media expert and experts from leading companies like ey spotify and google .
we only publish curated non-sponsored articles with the facts figures and wisdom you need to be wise and well-versed in the topics you care about .
i 'm at work and someone stole my milk what should i do ?
every text i send gets forgotten ignored and nobody wants to see me in person .
i 'll feel envy and just general sadness when i see people on social media happy smiling with friends .
this pandemic did n't cause it i 've always been alone .
i crave so much for every little interaction that i lose sleep over short dreams where i 'm touched or paid attention to .
this post will likely not even get replied to .
yes that 's me being woeful and attention seeking .
attention of any kind that is n't hostile is something you ca n't go without with no risk of going insane slowly .
so i know these cars are all drastically different but as of now these are the contenders .
basically i am downsizing from my 2011 tacoma as i rarely use my pickup for what it is and deciding to get a fun car as we already have a 4 door sedan for practicality .
i suppose at the end of the day i 'm just looking for a jekyll hyde sort of a vehicle where i can go from comfortable cruising to balls to the wall .
and as a musician well the audio system ca n't suck .
the jbl system in my tacoma is n't probably the best but because of the subs underneath the back seat and extremely balanced midrange/top end i 've come to love that system .
so this next vehicle ca n't sound like a budget boombox from big lots .
the taco is going to be sold to go towards this next vehicle .
budget is roughly 40k before applying my down payment .
i have n't test drove the rcf or the c7 yet hopefully tomorrow on the c7 rcf 's are hard to find !
but i have driven the stinger gt1 gt2 and at first i loved it !
i still think it is a great car but after testing it a second time i was sort of expecting more '' as far as thrills go and i do n't know why as it is a quick car .
it is one of the most comfortable cars i 've been in and has the features of a luxury car .
but i suppose it lacked emotion and this was something i noticed when testing a mustang gt premium .
so you might be asking why not get the mustang gt ? '' .
well although i have n't completely ruled it out i feel as if i might as well go all out for something special and mustangs are fairly common where i am at .
that said the mustang brought the emotional factor and had a life of its own .
my one complaint is the interior and as time goes on i know that it will not age well .
after watching savagegeese 's review on the rcf and my love for toyota/lexus in general i started researching the vehicle and found that it was quite the gem .
would be trying to pick this one up used so 40k .
the looks are n't as striking as the vette but it is in my opinion a very elegant yet aggressive look and the subtlety alone is something that is attractive .
the interior quality in the rcf is also fantastic and more my style .
and that mark levinson sound system has me curious .
as far as the c7 goes well i was always a vette fan as a kid .
i 'm in my mid 20 's and although it is considered a boomer mobile i do n't really care .
the design is timeless to me and the interior has improved over previous generations .
i do n't hear good things about the bose system but i 'll have to check that out for myself .
i know this is getting quite long and i appreciate those who may have some input on these cars .
i hope you see the dilemma and where my head is currently at with this obscure list of vehicles .
basically the stinger gt test drive introduced me to performance oriented cars but then made me think of what else is out there .
i felt that the stinger was good at everything but was n't great at one thing or bad at another .
in other words it had good enough performance good enough interior materials etc .
i feel the rcf and vette although very different will feel like much more special vehicles to keep in the garage and i 'll be excited to drive every single day .
i have a zapco st-4b amplifier hooked up to a pair of hertz ck-165 .
i have one single signal rca cable from head unit so i routed this thru the amplifiers back speakers line in out and in again at the front speaker line in .
i did this in laziness actually knowing there might be some signal loss .
well actually there is n't some signal loss but insane signal loss .
one might think the amplifier would send out a signal somewhat identical to the one getting in but this does n't seem to be the case .
i am therefore wondering if i split the rca cable into the amplifier channels or adding another cable from head unit this should fix the problem .
can someone please explain why i need to do this instead of routing the signal thru the amplifier ?
also there is another problem i found when adjusting the amplifier level on the left speakers to high i can hear the turbo sound from engine out of the speaker .
is this due to cables picking up noise from turbo ? .
when i tune the level down a bit the sound is n't noticeable anymore .
i ca n't get past telkor the unforgiving on the final assault mission .
beat him 5 times but he just keeps coming back because the groundskeeper is n't showing up so i can talk to her and advance .

did they really not fix this after all these years ?
i 've recently learned about skimboarding and i 've wanted to try it out .

if anyone knows a nice place with weak waves i would also appreciate it if you guys let me know .
i just finished my first campaign with gsz and i found myself constantly getting hit with the population penalty .
i just ended up wasting a bunch of money building the temple on most of my commanderies .
i also had bunch of free building slots lying around because i did n't know what to build and also if i should even develop a commandery .
is there a guide that someone posted on youtube regarding econ and buildings or a tier list that exists which i can use as a reference ?
i keep trying to make a grave on bedrock for my cat named after futaba and it keeps censoring it out

annoyingly the twitter api does n't supply any actual information about deleted tweets other then it 's id so for now the best i can do is give you a notification that some tweet has been deleted .
ours is short too though she 's only 8 months old .
man that build might be really good but you need to fix that cable mess or it will just looks really bad .
and i may suggest upgrading buying two more new fans for front .
i gave the pass wave to the leader of the group and a few more after him but after about 10 had passed i figured i did n't need to give the wave anymore .
it was a little sketchy a canyon twisty 2 lane road i tried to stay as far right as possible to let them all pass but got stuck anyways .
the idea that we all get to see what he ca n't anymore ... you are a bad girl !

he 's the best choice when compared to the alternative which is trump .
i do n't understand all this aggressive rhetoric against biden by supposedly progressive communities .
do you really think that trump is an option to further any progressive agenda ?

not only that but sometimes the flavor combinations are whack and the technique is seriously lacking/directions clearly do n't lead to the product pictured for any reasonable home cook .
there 's one blogger who comes to mind whose food is gorgeous but the few recipes i 've tried from her were trash and made it very clear she has no training .
i saw someone savagely review one of her cookbooks by saying that she 'd be better off as a food stylist than a recipe developer and i ca n't help but agree .
people in amazon reviews mentioned using the bioderma shower oil as a facial cleansing oil so i 've been curious about it .

coming from a male also 26yo i can say that not feeling like you 're getting enough or the desired kind of affection can be quite paralyzing .
i 'm at grips with what i 'm facing because in my mind it feels obvious that i 'm not getting enough attention/affection even after talking about it with her but i always find myself in my head wondering if i really need that much attention—or if i got said attention would i actually be happy ?
sometimes i 'll step back and feel i 'm too needy and my expectations are too high .
one thing specifically that bothers me about my gf is that i do n't really get good morning texts .
it makes it seem like i 'm a second thought to her because she could go all day without texting me and be cool with it .
i also realize that not everyone needs that amount or type communication to feel happy or go about their day .
in my mind i just wan na say hi to her and tell her good morning because i love her and i gratefully appreciate her and our talks .
i mean i love and adore her why would i not want to speak to her soon after waking up and starting my day ?
the thing that grinds my gears the most is that my reactions cause me to question myself constantly .
i 've had a couple girls give too much attention and that is sort of off-putting too because it does n't feel genuine .
all i can suggest is deeply analyze your needs and desires and figure out what 's actually important to you .
if that person is n't meeting your needs or desires then ultimately you 're only sacrificing your own happiness by staying with them .
but i get these super duper magical essential oils that will change your life !

i 'm not sure what level of intellect or integrity you can really expect out of that crowd .
still pretty ironic they 're using conservative articles as their sources
i 've been playing a list that is similar and having good success .
i think i like that your list forgoes the bigger slow spells in favor of even more board presence riposte and back2back at the moment .

do you have a garden or do you have to buy food ?
i moved out here full time in december so i 'm buying in bulk atm .
i 'm currently constructing an outdoor kitchen and putting a fence around that area .
once my fence is up i can plant my garden since it 's all open range for cows .
i have two 50g barrels and a 200g tank .
once my kitchen is finished i 'll be able to collect a little bit .
i started with one 260w solar panel and two 12v 35ah agm batteries .
this is plenty of energy if all you need to do is charge electronics run lights and maybe a fan .
i got two 12v 155ah batteries 3 260w panels and a new charge controller .
total cost for that was 600 plus a larger inverter putting it at 800 for the system .

i feel like i remember them never letting go of each other even when it was really awkward to keep holding hands .
but then again did n't anna and pest hold hands for a really long car ride ?
the problem is the crazy people on the right are actually in power .
i am a size 3.75 4 and have a 3 carat 10×8mm http imgur.com/a/dqdpfs7 ... so i think a 3 or 4 carat is good !
you ca n't just leave it at that i 'm gon na have blue balls of the brain now
i just ca n't understand the thought process of this kind of person .
if you have been out of work and are low on funds why would you even consider getting your car detailed ?
that 's not a necessity i would think it would n't even be on the list of things to budget for .

if u have one of those perks it wont flinch to the head .
i hope karma hit is wallet like a flaming rock on a mission from god !
do n't rely on toppers to fix your dish .
adding salt and pepper to top your eggs is fine but having your eggs taste perfect because you added salt and pepper in the pan is even better .
likewise get every piece of the dish right before adding it .
for example season your meat optimally before adding it to the chili do n't rely on the chili to fix it .
this will make your dishes on the whole more flavorful .
i struggled with negative emotions for a long time even after reading the meditations and visiting this sub multiple times a day .
it did n't matter how much i tried to be indifferent or try to understand what i could n't control i still felt awful .
now my circumstances might be different than yours but i work in a warehouse i live in a basement suit and because of covid i only go to work and hang out at home on my computer .
one day at work my boss asked me to go out in the yard for half a day and stack pallets .
oh great this is going to suck but it 's my job and it is what it is '' i thought to myself .
low and behold i had the best day that'v had in months .
it turns out that i was extremely vitamin d deficient .
that day i bought 1000 i/u vitamin d capsules and take two a day .
that 's just my situation and it worked for me .
it 's funny i used to get two and i got 32 once and i shit myself
you ca n't type your two year old brother because he has n't developed hardly any cognitive functions .
wait until he 's around 12 at least 9 if you 're that impatient which i think you are 😂
no but seriously thank you that makes a lot of sense
ok i get what you 're saying and also thank you for taking the time to explain it to me .
no that 's on you for not paying even a little bit of attention to how your livelihood was being funded as a grown ass man woman .
super heated gas and smoke are what you are trying to avoid .
early detection from smoke alarms and having a good family exit plan will save lives .

some of my family used to live in alaska and have friends from college who live in nyc .
if you 're like me and do n't want something that you do n't have to cut check out the flambeau ar tactical case on amazon .
and she starts off with i want you to be honest with me then when they 're being honest she gets confrontational throws a hissy fit and storms off .
i do n't remember when it was exactly but belle was saying to anton that she had been cheated on before and she was crying almost but anton did n't respond at all .
also i know it 's an edited show so maybe he comforted her at some point who knows .
while watching the match i was thinking that it 's a pity you have n't met kobashi in singles action .
i know you and him met face to face but it was in tag team action .
at least you fought one of his proteges which was highly reflected in this match .
i felt that before shiozaki would be counted out you were like i have to save his arse '' so you decided to go after him in order to break the count .
for a moment i thought he was passed out the man was a machine and went to the end for the win .
i was shocked when i read that you were expecting to lose your job with ring of honor .
was it because of larry sweeney leaving the company ?
i recall watching the 2009 year and i can tell you were lost in the shuffle i hope to be proven wrong though but the good thing is that the following year you revamped with the kings of wrestling reunion until 2011 when claudio left roh for wwe .
part of me stills disappointed you never got the big roh title .
once you make business with him you were the man .
words are meaningless actions say far more and biden has acted out of the interest of lgbtqia people too often in the past for anyone to be taking him seriously .
i 'm not saying 'let trump win ' i 'm saying either of these options are bad .
if people put their weight behind them it could actually bring about some substantial change .
but people are too cowardly to try and break the two party system .
i kept thinking it was a bent tie or something .
yeah definitely a repost he stretched the picture though .
you can always see a repost just by seeing how it 's cropped if it 's stretched etc .

someone in his flight tested positive and now they 're being put up in a hotel in separate rooms for two weeks .
yeah it 's strange how acceptable it is to inhale smoke for the hell of it .
yeah man u can def do that just set rules on what to do and not to do just do n't make a whole fucking contract and stuff .
yeah we should just be obtaining the launcher from the store as stated in the end of your comment .
if i turn out to be wrong later then i can just go ahead and leap from the 3rd story window .

the interesting thing for me is i could n't get into ac odyssey but my friend has been encouraging me to give it another shot .
i was never a big fan of any of the ac games and to be fair i did n't even get off the first island in odyssey .
i 'll have to re visit that one because i have heard wonderful things about it .
i know that a lot of people came away from the pre launch stuff like trailers and interviews etc with the impression that was the hordes role .
and so once they played the game many people ended up seeing the hordes as late game tier enemies and their first experience ended up being against the story hordes .
but they are n't endgame enemies unless you want them to be .
there are a large number of hordes lurking around from almost the very start of the game and before the you wo n't be coming back here for a while .
moment all the northern hordes are around to be fought .
they game just does n't try to force them on you .
but if you want to take them on all you have to do is go find them .
or accidentally drive around a corner and straight into one lol
when the game launched a friend and i immediately started looking for them and they killed their first one at level 6 and i killed the first one at level 3 .
and yes we all find out eventually that the northern hordes are the equivalent of training wheels for horde fighting '' .
but when you 're at the very beginning just starting out they can be as much fun as the monster sized hordes from later down the road .
it 's really a shame that there are some people who because of the late game enemy '' misconceptions miss out on a ton of fun they could 've been having from the start .
i 've even talked to one person who told me it was complete bull it and that they looked for days and there 's no possible way to face a single horde until chemult .
that person absolutely refused to believe it until they saw it on vid .
they missed out on a lot of crazy fun because they believed it when a review said you could n't face them till later and screwed themselves over because of it .
i think most people would 've had a better time if they had went looking for them early on .
or if bend had made them a little more obvious by doing more than just sending the player to the horse lake checkpoint where they were highly likely to see the death train as their first horde and think it was sort of scripted to happen like the later big story hordes .
you got the balls to go hunt them '' tutorial message would 've been better than not drawing players attention to them in the beginning in any meaningful way .
a whole bunch of people i 've talked to and gameplay i 've watched were be essentially people seeing the death train horde the first time and either getting destroyed by it .
or nopeing the hell out of there and not seeing another one till chemult .
i 'm swedish and it 's very old fashioned but classic here but i love it ! ! !
i just wrote a poem about a girl named viveka !
if you are sure that you have gotten rid of the fungal infection you can use it again .
you can use a blacklight torch to monitor it and refer to these slides https www.slideshare.net/azzasamy/woods-lamp-75654892 for the color you see .
so what are you contributing in return for the accomodation ?
haha i will admit that a few years ago i knew a girl that interned at fox 4 and i thought it was fox news which confused me because she was asian and liberal as far as i knew .
there shall be some frustration but do n't miss the fun part .

when i went i would say maybe a quarter to a third of stores were open .
they have a lot of markings on the floor to direct one-way traffic they 've got hand sanitizer at every entrance i saw a lot of people wiping things down and some stores have socially distant lineups outside of them because they 're only letting a limited number of people into each store .
overall it 's still got a ways to go but being out and about again was actually kind of nice .
nah i think i 'll wait a few days .
here 's his nyoubooru https nyou.booru.org/index.php ? page=post s=list tags=gassytank artist tho .
it 's fine she ca n't go see someone for a waxing and the shaving is a stopgap .
i like his work quite a bit i just know that he is not like me and does n't share my interests .
i 'm criticizing people who do n't understand that divide .
he says stuff on camera for the paycheck off camera .
and do you think you could possibly share a video of it ?
i 'd love to be able to see for myself
it was definitely interesting for the fighters of the time when everything was a mk clone not that those are bad lol
when i read stories about american characters and they use british terminology like that it throws me off and irritates me too .
just change a few words and it would be so much better !
so instead of being teased in school he 's getting the message that his own father does n't like who he is .
the idea that stupid bullies are bullying people or that your own father thinks you 're not the right kind of person ?
teach him to be confident and happy in anything he does and he will handle teasing just fine .
what he wo n't recover from as well is the lesson that his father does n't accept him for who he is and wishes he were a different person .
see if that works because it was how i fixed it the second time it happened idk how i fixed it the first .
however it started happening whenever my phone dies while i 'm screen recording
depends on the store but starbucks definitely sounds like a better situation for you .

i love wildforce so i reckon i can give this a head canon filled nonsense go .
so personally i 've always believed the wild force powers are some of the strongest in pr .
so we know the wildzords are sorta compatible with other zords .
blue shark white tiger and elephant zord combining with the thunderstorm megazord i know this only happened in the sentai but still and red lion in super megaforce while also being able to channel samurai .
also that the red lion is able to change to suit its needs like when he grew to combine with the falconzord .
maybe the red lion sensing the earth was in danger decided to change himself to be compatible with with the legendary megazord since the other wildzords had n't awoke and neither did princess shayla so no summoning the wild force rangers to help.. yet .
and now that he realises how much work it would be to implement such a feature he could n't be bothered

which system of teaching yoga asana is most likely to help earnest seekers ?
i see so much beauty in ashtanga with the fatal flaw of no clear instruction that i have found on how to adjust a prescribed series something i can practice day in and day out to suit my own state in the body .
i may simply have yet to find the right teacher of course .
that said and it could just be me but as i look around i see ashtanga waning in popularity and i think for this very reason it 's too hard and inflexible !
popularity means nothing but it is a good signal about what people find useful .

systemic injustice and systemic oppression can be objectively observed/analyzed with empirical evidence .
why is the forced shut-down of confucius institutes institutes not mcarthur style fascism ?
well first of all fascism is rooted in an authoritarian government which the us/canada/aus are not .
more importantly however confucius institutes are propaganda outlets for spreading the ccp 's nazi agenda .
as quoted by the ccp 's minister of propaganda himself
coordinate the efforts of overseas and domestic propaganda and further create a favorable international environment for us chinese minister of propaganda liu yunshan exhorted his compatriots in a 2010 people 's daily article .
with regard to key issues that influence our sovereignty and safety we should actively carry out international propaganda battles against issuers such as tibet xinjiang taiwan human rights and falun gong .
... we should do well in establishing and operating overseas cultural centers and confucius institutes .
confucius institutes are 100 ccp propaganda aimed at spreading nazi rhetoric to garner sympathetic support for the party 's human rights abusing agenda against ethnic minorities and taiwan .
how exactly is kicking out fascist propaganda from your country an act of fascism ?
it 's fascist to kick out fascists ? ? ?

since korra already peaked as a waterbender before book two or three i can reasonably use examples of korra 's waterbending from those seasons in this discussion because her skill level is the same as in book one .
it 's true she learned spiritual waterbending from unaloq in book two but this is a niche non-combat skill that is not applicable to her fight with azula .
i exclude book four because there is a three-year gap between seasons where korra 's bending power obviously did fluctuate significantly and so any waterbending examples good or bad in that season are obviously not representative of her book one skill and therefor off limits .
while using examples from book two sounds counter-intuitive to the point of this thread its is fair because korra 's waterbending skill is relatively the same throughout the first three chapters .
ignoring examples in these seasons would be more about principle and mindlessly adhering to the title of the thread than accurately measuring korra 's waterbending skill at the start of book one .
with that said if examples in books one two or three are fair game which for all intents and purposes they absolutely should be then i have examples on-hand from the those seasons that make me very confident korra 's waterbending matches azula 's firbending .
secondly i 'm not nor have i ever said korra was jobbing the whole first season i only said that her very first fight against amon 's chi blockers was obvious jobbing korra has no trouble fighting off several of these characters mere days later which is more representative of her average skill level .

there 's definitely more to the mother killing herself than her husband moving on .
depression is very complex and can devoid a person of logical thinking .
it can cause your brain to turn against itself and believe things that are n't true .
you feel like the right thing to do is to kill yourself because you 're a horrible person and your kids will be better off without you .
it can also be caused by maaany different factors including genetics increasing the likelihood so although we see her at her breaking point there 's a good chance there were other factors at play than just her husband moving on .
try to imagine living with an internal dialog that is always against you and twisting things to appear in the most negative way possible .
maybe they stayed up to late on their phone and they 're sleepy etc .

im not an expert but i think the best way to start forgiving yourself would be to remember this time in your life remember the person you strive to be and keep those morals .
its not always easy coming back from them but putting effort into how you want to better yourself from those mistakes gradually leads to forgiving yourself for them .
it wont come overnight it will take some time but one day youll look back on it and be proud of yourself for putting in the effort .
you will always be harder on yourself than anyone else ever will .

so i 'm a micro-managing type of player for some of my longest saves i even keep irl notes to stay on top of the townies ' activities and goings-on concerning my sims and the world .
also when i 'm playing a challenge i strictly follow the rules so for example if i 'm doing an extreme version of rags to riches there 'll be no selling directly from inventory kleptomania asking for a loan etc .
long story short my sister got offended when i would n't let her play a bit with my saves even though she lets me play on hers .
i think that 's different since she does n't strictly follow any challenge or rules she just kind of does whatever in the game .
point being our style of playing is very different .
i 'd let her make her own save on my computer and play there but she does n't want that which makes me believe she just wants to mess around with my sims .

hypothetically if you were playing a midlane mage like ahri just as a random example and you happened to get first blood on your opponent laner 2 to 3 minutes in the game .
assuming your cs is average lets say 8 cs by 3 mins you have roughly 560-600ish gold what do you do ?
should you back to buy something to get an advantage over your lane opponent ?
should you stay in lane to farm while they run back to lane so you can save up for last chapter ?

ludo is a strategy https ludoway.com board game for two to four players in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die
from playing with different scoring and league settings some with 1st down pprush and yardage bonuses and large starting rosters i wanted to see how value of positions and players change .
contrary to excel spreadsheets i started compiling a jupyter notebook python in my spare time in order to make some investigations .
for those unfamiliar with jupyter it 's a really easy tool to let you run code that others have written .
the notebook that i will share once i am no longer embarrassed about my hacky code downloads nfl data from past years from pro-football-reference.com https pro-football-reference.com for you and then let 's you enter your league 's scoring settings and calculates fantasy points for those settings .
the queries/filters are not too different from other database structures .
i 'm currently going through to satisfy my own curiosities but i want to add some more features that will allow you to plug in your roster s and use expert projections for the 2020 season to give you an idea where each team in your league is projected to land points-wise .
i found some initial projections that are freely available but i would happily take recommendations of experts that were successful in the past .
the jury on some of the questions i had is still out and i will share them once they are presentable .
with this post i wanted to ask for ideas/trends on what the sub would find interesting to scope out .
hope i have n't scared anyone off with deviating from the common spreadsheet approach i have some cs background but must say python dataframes are really similar and easy to learn !
and am looking forward to some ideas from you .
calculate fp and points per game for every player based on your scoring settings and just about any query you can imagine top 12 wrs under 25 every year the wrs on their team for that season etc .
top 100 board per season follow player scores over the years
comparing customable tiers top 8/10/12 top 24 to one another and plotting some shabby graphs known spoiler te and rb dropoffs were pretty big for my te premium pprush and pp 1st down league wr was really flat
incorporate some measure of value over replacement to really find advantages when constructing rosters or drafting startups there have been posts on this before
incorporate expert projections for 2020 and reason about likely fantasy production feature to pull in roster data easily

a couple months ago when my boyfriend was preoccupied with something i saw a text and a call from his sister .
the text was about his mom 's condition worsening and that he should come to the hospital before she goes .
i went into his phone and deleted and blocked his sisters and a couple other relitives phone number and deleted texts about the situation .
i didnt want him to see her because his family hated me for some reason and i wanted to punish his mom by preventing her from seeing her son for the last time .
i was relived one of his family members was going .
he found out that she died a couple days later .
he was so torn up that he didnt get to talk to her .
here i am a couple months later still worried that he might find out what i did .
i dont know how he might find out but what should i do when he does or how do i prevent him from finding out .

i just wanted to get an idea of what you guys and gals do for risk management .

throughout my trading education i have always been taught to use a stop loss like it is my life line in trading .
do you all think a stop loss is as important as other think is it extremely vital ?
does using a stop loss put you ahead of the average trader ?

so basically my girlfriend and i are financially comfortable with stable jobs and no debt .
we have an emergency fund covering at least 6 months in rent and expenses .
for a while i have been considering investing in real estate .
i was n't sure whether to buy a home for ourselves or rental properties to generate passive income .
as our long-term plans are still not clear i think it makes more sense to build a portfolio of rental properties .
that way i am also not necessarily tied to any specific place in case we decide to move .
we have both excellent credit scores and access '' to ny ga fl primarily thinking about atlanta and jacksonville but i would be open to any region that makes sense .
how do i best prepare for this during the time we ramp up our equity ?
how much equity should i target in order to start small ?
how do i select a project '' considering i am out of state and ca n't have a look at apartments/houses anyway ?
what to look out for in terms of financing primary vs rental taxes laws etc ?
for the past few weeks i have been scouring through the webs and of course the wiki here and summarizing all the information i could find while building my spreadsheet for financing tax implications etc .
a case study using one sample property would be quite helpful but have n't come across anything substantial so far .
i plan to document everything i am reading/learning and put it into a package that i can provide to others .

9 years of clinical depression suddenly gone because of a few life decisions and a medicine change .
for anyone suicidal/depressed you can get better and you will if you keep diligent .
i have a few mental illnesses that i know about i was diagnosed back when i had depression .
now that it 's gone i have noticed many things about myself .
most of them leave or fade away because they do n't understand me and i do n't understand them .
it 's like they 're talking a totally different language .
i ca n't pick up on social cues make friends or get a girlfriend .
this lack of social knowledge makes it really hard to find a relationship or friends .
i 'm thinking of going and attempting to get myself diagnosed by a professional .
but does anyone have any tips for understanding people ?
i have tried support groups and clubs to no avail .
people just think i 'm weird and for the most part they 're right .
i think i just need to find a way to learn their language .

i hit all my goals this last week except the diet ones i had some wonky days .
some of my days were better than expected and i hit my target 2000 calories but then some i was so overwhelmed i did n't even try .
i did n't take a single walk last week .
i was in a lot of pain and depressed and honestly just lazy and stubborn .
so goals i 'm keeping the same i believe except adding one for no masturbation and upping my goal of 1 masturbation a day
no porn no peeking try not to mindless browse no reddit other than clean\_lds
no more than 4000 calories a day and 3 days no more than 3000 1 day no more than 2000 .
i think i can do that ... maybe this is n't the best method but we 'll try it out
i am feeling confident in myself aside from the diet but i feel good with masturbation like i can somewhat handle it .
is making orgasm hard to reach so i 'm just not as interested in it .

from past experiences what have you found to be the best way to try and acquire broken/for parts/working vintage macintosh machines ?

i 've been tooling around in cad for the past few days now and have decided on making a sort of men 's valet like a dresser tray for my desk but with some added functionality usb charging ports embedded wireless charger under the surface of the wood pen holder etc .
all of these features would be in the wood portions not the resin .
how machinable is the wood/resin once it 's cast/cured ?
can i take a chamfer bit to the edge ?
can i make other router cuts or chop/table saw cuts ?
the actual main surface of the project is nominally 1 '' which i assume is totally fine with resin but what about the side walls ?
can i cast a 1/4 '' sheet of wood/resin and then cut it into pieces and affix them to the base with screws ?
https cad.onshape.com/documents/b85e68cb67485e2fec682e14/w/1900ce3ef357efcf16ed1aab/e/80f830b652d81f7504544b42 you can click on two different points to measure in between them but the overall dimension is 8x12 .
i run a 3.5 game mostly because it 's the system all of my players already know .
i own several 5e books though and i 've played it before but i ca n't figure out what the appeal of it is to people who are already familiar with 3.5 and its rules .
from what i do know it 's not as rule-heavy and you usually do n't have to keep track of a series of 1s or 1s because much of it has been replaced with the advantage/disadvantage system .
and that does a lot to keep the game from getting bogged down ... usually .
the reason 3.5 appeals to me personally is because of all the options available .
it 's kind of hard to make a character in 5e that feels wholly different from their base character class .
the feat skill and prc options are really sparse and it 's not easy to translate them from 3.5 to 5e .
wiz from the beginning said 5e was made to be homebrew-able to adjust to players ' preferences but homebrewing 5e to feel more like 3.5 would be a herculean effort and at the end of the day you may as well just play 3.5 and just deal with having to do more addition .
now of course complexity is not always a good thing .
but 5e is doomed to reach 3.5 's complexity at some point .
wotc ca n't really make money off 5e without releasing more and more expansions so in a few years you wo n't be able to bring a fighter 10 to the table and remain somewhat comparable to the guy who brought a wizard 1/cleric 4/mystic theurge 2 void disciple 3 .
that being said you can more easily trim 3.5 's complexity down than you can scale 5e 's complexity up .
anyway what was it that converted the rest of you

i likely ca n't meet up due to my age and the covid-19 pandemic but it 's at least nice to know that there 's someone there .
please upvote this so they can see as there 's been so many posts about this in the past but they have n't noticed the huge bug in the ai 's use of nukes .
ai 's will always nuke the same city repeatedly no matter what they currently have no way of telling if they have already nuked the city or checking what health the city has as a result they will keep on firing at it until they run out of nukes every time .
this has been an issue in the game since release and is such an easy fix in theory but modders do not have the tools to correct it .
in the new frontier pass announcement you said how you would have the opportunity to have a conversation '' with the players about what they would like addressing fix this issue please late game wars are so stale because of it .
edit see this video for an example of the issue in an ai only match without mods .
i have a few months of comics bios and stories to catch up with is there a handy list of material by release date anywhere that i can use as a guide ?
basically i am trying to buy a console from someone .
they have it marked on a buy it now listing at £200 which is much lower than market value £350 and they have the same listing as an auction which is now at £180 .
they 're selling other consoles in the same way .
all the buy reviews are from accounts selling spammy looking products and really random things .
accounts with products that just do n't looks 'real ' .
it sounds too good to be true and the ebay money back guarantee makes it appeal to buy it and see what happens .
mine is the screen magnifier that attaches to the top of the sp and folds up .
my eyes apparently are n't what they used to be !
i still have all of mine that metal game case thing was definitely worth getting as a kid .
i 'm new to this community and thought a question would be the best way to say hello .
i am only looking for trades at the moment but will accept ammo for certain items .
everything is max level and all perks are listed .
some items are in use and i would need a really good trade to let them go .
how are any of the subsonic jets going to deal with a plane so fast it can time out the missiles fired at it ?
i am planning to build my first ever pc and i am looking for any advice in what parts should i keep/remove from my part picker list .
i 'm knocking out my masters in data science strategy and leadership .
one of the units i 'm doing is data wrangling and the course content is severely lacking .
a couple of us have been posting on the discussion pages looking for advice for one part of an assignment .
we need to create a list and join it to a data frame using the dplyr package .
i have a list and i have a data frame .
everything i understand about joins tells me i will need to change the class of my list to a data frame to use the dplyr semi_join function .
the lecturer has eluded that we should n't need to in general but has n't given away any more than that .
this has confused me because eveything ive read says i need to join two data frames .
yes you are required to post it 's entire history including all previous owners .
i ended m3 on surgery so i thought i would need the extra time .
might wan na take a look at the most recent post the clan donation one too .
i do n't have to be on my network for to control lights and smart plugs that are on their own vlan .
as long as the devices can get to the internet you can control them.. only when you were setting them up the first time do you need to be on the same network.. alteast all the ones i have some tplink ones and then 3 other off brand models of lights and switches .
again do n't put yourself in a situation to be arrested and if by chance it does happen and you 're innocent it is what it is honestly not just gon na let some people sit comfortable in the back seat and handcuff others .
so i was the tree in a past life or just the shoe ?

its true my sister is a bts fan and even she noticed
i mean probably but unlike minecraft it makes sense in warframe
most people just get there files off of thingiverse .
and it 's easier to get aluminum pulleys that would outlast everything else .
yeah i 'm pretty sure they were following the same processes that most companies and doctors offices with testing shortages were doing
yes but they should do a bigger cast and more move sets
i honestly didnt mind that we had class based move sets rather than character based .
some warrior games follow a similar concept anyway weapon based moveset .
imo they should make maps based on some moments in the series instead of actually trying to write a story like feh .
for example binding blade could have a map based on ch7/8 and another based on 21 .
she also voiced another twin character in the recent pso2 anime so there already precedent of twins character voicing her .
no immediate punishment for not showing up and me not being prepared to hold myself accountable made college very depressing
i meant the fact that it 's declared at 14 .
i am not trying to be a smart ass i promise but just measure the team bag .

mmhmm yeah i see.. i say not really knowing the problem .
i 'm actually a worse student than you are but i ca n't admit that .
i watch carefully as your tits bounce after every page turn i feel myself licking my lips without even thinking .
uhh okay sure.. i say shaking my head out of it trying to think of some bullshit way to pseudoteach
ml7 's been doing some unranked to gm streams which are completely educational .
i also like watching jjonak streams in the morning if he 's ever streaming because i ca n't understand what he 's saying so i 'm basically forced to focus on the gameplay and his decision making .
but there are like at the very minimum 30 people working together to perform classical music unlike rock where usually it 's at minimum 4 people .
therefore it requires more effort to stay in sync which should be applauded .
after yesterdays conference i do n't believe it will go anywhere .
durham constabularys piecemeal approach to statements is frustrating and not a good indication of something that is going to be pursued .
still an offside chance he may resign i 'd say albeit a relatively small one .
i 'm not a sweat i do n't like fighting constantly i like to pick and choose my fights not just run in and kill .
however i 'm concerned that because some businesses are seeing that they never needed many of the jobs they had .
a lot of businesses have been able to run just as efficiently with a smaller workforce and a lot of those people are working from home .
it 's inevitable that most jobs will just be dialed in from home since businesses wo n't need building and office setups for their employees thereby saving a fuckton of money .
but if the business is making just as much as it was with 25 less workforce they are n't going to hire more people or even a lot more people .
i 'm not an economist but this ca n't be good for the economy .
i 'm teaching myself cyber security and encryption because i 'm furloughed and from what i hear the job wo n't be there for many of us and we will need new skills to remain relevant in the job market
so there is a whole heap of people who go to school and who are n't very technical i know you learned some code and that is great .
you learn to sound really smart but do n't actually become useful to man or beast .
the online guides figure there is a cover for every pot so they all suggest the typical shit lawyer and diplomat like you said .
peter turchin refers to this process as elite overproduction .
the world only needs so many policy makers speech writers and other forms of bullshit artists .
and if you have n't already started to break into that world i ca n't tell you how to start .
in my experience the ones who succeed are assholes .
take any entry level job you can find and play the political game .
initiate projects that will get you promoted before they fail .
learn a trade in the broadest sense of some kind of technical skill .
you dipped your toes into this and did n't like it but there are many many trades .
if you 're still looking for someone happy to help !
i know it is but i do n't know their number or name or anything i only know their reddit account
wow i have rex and the inside of his house does not look like that !
god i honestly dislike people like bikini‚ because they praise the game even though they might know how shitty it is sometimes .
but people just defend it because it 's their favorite game sometimes people do n't wan na expect the fact which is understandable .
while they 're both rad this thing was on a whole other level of just fun quirkiness that just felt like a much nicer samurai .
do n't let that be the reason you stay with someone who treats you poorly .
a good friend of mine got herpes from her boyfriend in high school because he cheated on her .
she still went on to have healthy relationships of course she disclosed this information to her partners and she has now been with a great guy for over 5 years .
just because you have herpes does not mean no one else will want to be with you .
my actual first thought was i wonder if i could catalog that arcade game '' i 'm too far gone .
watch thus spoke kishibe rohan ova there are 4 episodes centered around rohan pretty good stories imo .
low-effort posts trolls treating the sub like google etc will be deleted .
if you have a simple question your first stop should be google not here .
when guys like this request nudes and then start attacking a girl 's physicality when they say no i like to imagine the guy is going i 'll show you '' and badly drawing their own nudes of the girl then describing them to her .
i 'm wondering if you could use shortcuts to create an automated workflow to move all your videos to files or some other cloud service ?

the nazis had green insignia like this https en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/l_army_corps wehrmacht and this https en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/81st_infantry_division wehrmacht .
you genuinely think that having green is an excuse to spread your satanic propaganda !
if you keep checking to see if it happened than you are admitting to yourself it has n't and you do n't fully believe it has correct ?
and what is it about an assumption though it may be false if persisted in will harden to fact .
if we are uncertain that 's where we will be stuck and not get what we really want .
the grass definitely is n't greener on the other side my friend .
i can understand your perspective as a close friend of mine broke up 7 years into a relationship because he felt like he didnt have enough experience with other people .
fast forward years later he now regrets this decision and wishes that he had married that person .
the way you phrase it however it seems almost like you envy others for having this phase '' .
while understandable try to acknowledge that that lifestyle brings a lot of uncertainty and that you now neglect all of the downsides that come with that lifestyle .
as for myself i 'm 20 and looking for someone who fits me like what you 're describing .
i yearn for a stable relationship like what you have so bad i really do envy you .
all i wan na say is that you should n't throw something extremely valuable away for some short-term gratification .

the problem is that they 've pinned themselves to hard left social issues as well as the environment .
they 're trying to cover too many bases for a small party .
if they were willing to drop some of the hard left policies i honestly think they would end up accomplishing much more in the long run .
but their voters are extremely ideological as the other commenter explains so they ca n't do this .
they will always be the vocal little sibling of labour .

hi amm at the door to vordt inside the room i cant put the sign and wich pass ?
omg i have been trying to find someone that understands this forever .
like when i was a kid i was watching tv and i saw one of those ads going this poor child in africa could have shoes for only 4 dollars and even then i smelled the bs coming from the tv .
when i got older i saw this great documentary on amazon prime called poverty inc. that basically said
my dudes people living on the continent of africa do not live in straw huts and wear rags .
like in north america or any continent for that matter there are people like the ones in the ad living in poverty .
but what that ad does is allow the charity to hoard the money and only give the bare minimum to these people and most of the time what happens is they give shoes or whatever other goods to people who do not need it .
it would be like if this dude showed up at your school and gave you shoes .
hes one of the best scorers but he does n't do much in the facilitating game .
hes right up there with lebron as a scorer but lebron brings top 10 all time passing jordan was also an amazing creator and facilitator .
curry similarly has a huge benefit to his teammates offensively .
durant just does n't which is why all of his offensive metrics do n't really paint him in the lebron/curry tier of offensive impact .
now thump and sound in bs6 is not as much as compared to old royal enfield bikes still little bit manageable by after market exhaust .
other than this i have not experienced any downside in my 4 month but have to mention now it 's having very less vibration and more pickup due to efi system and refined engine .
the op is vague enough that they could be playing paladins every game .
i do n't think making a character that clashes with paladins or asking the eternal paladin player to mix it up means you are leaning towards sociopathic . ''
so there is at least one way we can read the op and not call a stranger who we 've only heard about second hand a sociopath .
no thanks do n't want to find it reposted other places .
believe me my face is so ugly it 'd become the biggest meme since the egghead man lmao .
at some point there is just gon na be an emotion explosion .
kagura 's mom seems surprisingly chill around all the child abuse and property damage .
i thought the options were child rejection or overprotectedness apparently option 3 is xanax .
constant prolonged erection needs to be seen at a hospital as it is called priapism .
if it continues it can cause even more nerve and tissue damage so it needs to be seen asap .
however i myself do not experience erection so it varies person to person .
my issue is the nerves themselves go into such a frenzy that an erection or natural release becomes unable to happen .
so here is what i recommend as a action plan .
it is rare for a male to report this issue but it is assumed that men just dont report it .
plus they also believe that just like 1 of women having the issue the same 1 of men have the issue .
there are tests and they may refer you to a spine specialist to search for any spinal anomalies .
they also may refer you to a pelvis specialized physical therapist to help relieve and move pelvic pressure .
be careful as constant use of these can cause medical issues .
three depending on how invasive the issue is a therapist may be needed so that you have a place that you can relieve any mental stress it causes and trust me it causes a ton of stress .
there are also some psych meds that may help .
four a pain specialist may be needed as a last resort as there are various pelvic nerve branches that they can do blocks for and also various medications that can be recommended .
you will be put on a pill management plan to monitor and make sure you dont abuse the medications .

plug in your phone in your room but far away from you before bed and make sure multiple alarms are on .
that way you 're forced to get out of bed to turn them on but you 'll wake up

especially the unknown risk of the newfangled mrna one .
other day in jersey city i saw a bright dot in the day time sky float fast away and disappear in an instant i think that was also balloons
i never said i did n't want a shitty response .
but i looked at the dudes twitter after i read this thread i 'm seriously skeptic .
people have told jd that they hope his sister gets raped .
but he made a sex joke about a millionaire you do n't know personally .
try to steal bags and phones most of the time
i know it 's really just a matter of doing it theres no secret lol .
i landed a couple on carpet while it was raining but tomorrow is the real deal .
i have no idea what you mean by a fungus that the plants like '' as fungus is normal and natural in garden beds .
as for mixing soil if you ca n't use a shovel or spade to dig in the bed then mix the soil and compost in a wheelbarrow or other large container then transfer it to the bed .
make sure you have very high nitrogen levels by the branches as they need nitrogen to break down and will steal it from your crops .
got the greenest nuts this side of the oil spill
do n't have anything to offer but wow that is a gorgeous board .
crossplay makes it so there 's 1 big player base and 3 small ones and the small ones ca n't really complain about queue times because they can fix them by enabling crossplay
i like this community cause well for one your giving away a case and i love the content helped me build a pc
that 's what happens when you become money hungry and release packs of mounts that people can buy for gold 🤷🏻‍♂️
i know no one asked but relevant song https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=38xbrxrnwqk .
i try to be perfectly pleasant but damn if anyone actually wanted to talk to me other than if they needed help with an assignment .
you can definitely be a one trick and climb to plat 4 in tft but to get into diamond you have to have multiple comps you can play depending on what you 're given and to succeed in diamond you have to learn how to position and scout other people 's boards while being able to play a variety of comps well .
as mismatched socks said he thinks the easiest way to climb is to play flex all the time but that takes practice .
rn i 've been in diamond but am back in plat and am trying to learn how to always play flex and it 's much more enjoyable than forcing a comp every game .
mine has polytheism as the dominant belief system in the story .
with this there hundreds and hundreds of gods recognized by every culture with only minor differences .
some are more serious/general kinds and many are like the god of pet peeves '' or god of bread '' etc .
some are satires of real life people and legends and one of the most well known and respected one is the god of irony .
characters take most of them seriously but the god aspect itself is more of a joke on what limits gods can rule over .
there are certainly more fun stuff like that since comedy is almost the dominant genre of my original story but the god thing is the main ongoing goofy bit that gets brought up here and there through mentions hallucinations and in-world literature/art .
wrong opinions are a thing that exist my dude .
if you think that an opinion ca n't be wrong well i 'm sorry to say your opinion on that is wrong as well .
i do n't think op is irrational because he thinks dogs are dirty it 's a fact that they are .
but it 's also a fact that this dirtiness wo n't be an issue if he is a good dog owner .
this is what leads me to believe he is a germaphobe because objectively this dirtiness is n't generally an issue to anyone medically .
unless they have a weak immune system or something .
and someone who is germaphobic has an irrational fear of germs .
phobia is defined as an extreme or irrational fear of or aversion to something so yes it is by definition irrational .
i 'm not saying op has to own a dog or has to like dogs .
nor do i think he should be fine with how dirty dogs are .
all i 'm saying is his fear is irrational .
there 's no shame in that phobias are stuff people just have and there 's no way to really control it .
one can acknowledge their phobia of something is irrational yet still hold the same opinion on that thing .
so op can absolutely keep finding dogs dirty and disgusting and i have no issue with that my whole argument is that this fear is irrational because objectively dirty dogs dirty as in simply took him out for a walk or something have no medical issues tied to them unless the owner is either bad or has a weak immune system .
if you think my points make no sense then go ahead and explain why .
i 'm not upset that you called me a dickhead i simply pointed it out because the general rule is that when someone resorts to insults they 've lost the debate .
when you think about being immortal at first it sounds cool but when u really think about it it 's really really really sad
you look like the dude who gets fucked by all the bigger dudes in prison .
the problem is that when it comes to comparing beethoven to beating sticks is that at the end of the day surely the most important objective cultural value is how at peace someone feels ?
undervolt it and put the tablet into battery saver mode .
deadass the same people that fly that flag also rim cops .
look i get it trust me but you got ta understand one thing is that they 're people who are working long hours maybe with some shit pay getting all these orders out the door asap .
if it has not shipped then they never had it in stock in your case and they will have to let you know that you might have a new estimated delivery date .
also the pandemic killed manufacture because they can only produce with so much with maybe half or no staff at all .
if you do n't hear anything call amazon and see if you and them can work out something if you cancel right now and look somewhere else the chance of you finding a board are not the odds in your favour
i hate battle royales i find them boring and lacking action too much downtime and looting is redundant
wikipedia is a good place to start if you want to learn about them .
they are mostly discriminated against for mostly the same reasons minorities are discriminated against racism .
romani migrated to europe from india around 500 ad .
and were then hated and enslaved and expelled from different nations for the crime of not being european and wanting to keep their traditions .
you 'll notice the other user that replied to you and me used language similar to how racists on pol talk about black and hispanic-americans 13 or the population 50 of the crime shit .
all while ignoring that the assimilations he was talking about were mostly by force or in the case of france a few years ago just straight up kicking a bunch of them out .
it 's all the same racism we see here in america with the same reasons just with different people and skin tones .
imagine coming home to your girl cheating on you only to get your ass beat by some dude in his underwear who was hiding in the closet .
do u get irritated as well by the edge screen touching your palms ?

i 'll only replay on homer on two distinct situations either 1 i hit the ball so goddamn far that i absolutely need to see where it landed and how far it went in which case i 'll usually end the replay as soon as the distance pops up on the screen ... it 's just better than checking the game log or 2 my opponent replayed their homers and i replay as a kind of payback unless i 'm down a lot of runs ... then it 's just dumb do replay when it 's low leverage

i am an ebay seller who does around 15k worth of business monthly .
i sell auto parts and my return rate is 10 with a little over half the people claiming the parts are not as described to get a free return .
this month after being on ebay for years i see this additional 5 fee for very high ‘item not as described ' rates '' in my invoice that started this month .
does anyone know what the rate is or what time period the rate is calculated for ?
hoping to get a little help choosing speaker and and amp .
the system will just be for music and i 'll primarily be listening in the living room 14 ' x 18 ' although it 's a small 1000sq .
ft open-concept house so it will at least initially still serve as my music source when in the kitchen and dining room may be interested in options for running additional speakers to the kitchen in the future .
looking to spend 200 for the speakers amp but could go a bit higher maybe up to 300 if there was something substantially better .
plan on using it as a networked music player connected to a pi dac or pi hdmi avr if i go that route for listening to my existing music library .
i 'm not into shaking my whole house listening to anything super loud it 's a small house and i have a young kid in the home but would appreciate something with a crisp un-muddied sound since moving i 've currently been listening on a single portable bluetooth speaker so almost anything is going to be a nice upgrade .
i 'm open to bookshelf or floor standing speakers up to 36 '' high i.e .
if bookshelf they 'd probably go on end-table 's about 10 ' apart on opposite sides of our love-seat .
if floor standing they 'd be on the ends of the main couch which is probably not ideal as that 's the couch i 'd most often be listening from .
pic of the living room setup if it 's helpful
i 'm also fine with used although i do n't seem to have a huge selection on craigslist/fb locally and do n't want to keep looking forever .
for speakers was originally planning to go with some mb42x 's that seem pretty popular here .
however would these still function well for whole room audio most seem to be using them as desktop speakers ?
looks like i missed the sale from last week but not sure if these go on sale regularly ?
i 'm reasonably handy and am open to building some c-notes as well but with a young kid giving me limited time i 'd probably only go that route if there was n't anything ready-built in a similar price range .
any of those that would stand out as a best fit for my needs ?
do n't exactly know what i 'm looking for but i 've seen a few older denon 's locally but none of the models commonly recommended on here .
is it good idea to mix little bit off 4-fma with 2-fma
hi i recently started keeping neon tetras and was wondering what advice you would have for a beginner .
hi there i own this cooler http www.walmart.com/ip/coleman-70-qt-heavy-duty-marine-cooler-100-can-white/34105098 and i 'm noticing after using it that the lid being opening causes the hinges to flex since there 's no tether .
eventually i imagine the plastic that the hinges are screwed into will fail and the cooler will either be useless or wo n't have hinges at least without some serious hacking .
i 'd like to stop that from happening by installing a lid tether like this one https i.imgur.com/usd0ayk.jpg .
unlike the cooler in that picture there are no mount points built in so i would need to drill screws into parts of the cooler that were n't designed for screws i 'm concerned that there wo n't be enough for the screws to hold onto and that either it 'll end up breaking the plastic when someone opens it too aggressively or the screws will back themselves out and moisture will get into the cooler walls .
any of y'all have any experience with the taurus 415 its out of production i really cant get anymore guns this year but i 'm on the lookout for one early next year .

please let me know and if there are any other methods for getting thick hair less poofy and uncontrollable .
already did icon pack and ca n't decide who the better option is .

fedex thinks my address doesnt exist and there seems to be no way to solve this problem long term via standard customer support routes .
i 'll start by saying this isnt all thier fault google and the architect of my building has blame all around .
basically my front door is up a small concrete path next to some bushes on the north side of the building .
google ends the directions on the south side of the building and because of the way the fourplex is built it looks like there are only two units on the south side and that my front door is a back door to one of those two units .
i 've requested google put the pin on the street to the east of us where the concrete path is but never hear anything back .
once about a year ago i spoke with the local hub after getting the number and they said theyd put a permanent note on my address that would auto include delivery instruction they called back later to say they actually could n't do that but would make a personal note .
it was very nice of them and it helped for awhile but i 'm back to every package i try and recive saying incorrect/invalid address . ''
now no one will give me the hub number which i get but is frustrating becaus they are the only ones who explaining this too would help .
the help center just says they 'll send it again tommrow but i 'm pretty sure the same thing will happen again .
i know i can just send it to a fedex store but is it so much to ask that i can get packages to my front door in the middle of a large city ?
it 's not the drivers fault it 's the systems both google and fedex 's .
no one will help me and i 'm just so exhausted with this .
it 's been 3 years now of fedex never getting my house on the first second and sometimes third fourth or fifth try .
i never use fedex if possible because the ups hub was able to add the note and the usps always finds it fine but i cant always choose who something is sent by and it just seems fedex can not solve this problem .
i typically keep my watch on silent but when i 'm using my airpods i always have my iphone ringer on however the notifications still go to my watch instead of my iphone .
i do n't always feel the vibration of the watch so i end up missing notifications .
i 'm not sure why this is n't an ios default or at least option but it would be great to get a tweak that does this !
any notice the match making ranks being completely messed up right now ?
yesterday i was mg1 playing against dmg and lems .
howdy i am in search of songs that y'all think are songs that people who dislike kpop would enjoy .
i 'm talking songs with a more western approach or production style rock or hip hop heavy jazzy etc and why you think the song has that kind of appeal .
i am making a playlist so that i can help introduce kpop to others !
i use windows capture title match otherwise same executable and start recording .
all is good when people are talking but once they switch to screen sharing mode obs does not continue to capture the screen feed though audio still continues .
is there a way to set obs so that it continues recording regardless of what mode zoom is in ?
i have a good kd of 1.3 this season .

my nephew turned 2 at the start of may and he hardly says a word .
personally i 'm not worried as he 's got a full tongue tie that was refused to be cut by a bitchy nurse who basically said if he does n't latch i 'm not cutting it so it 's been pushed until he 's 4/5
he says simple things like ma dad nan please tah cheese milk etc it 's a very limited vocabulary .
he identifies people and mostly speaks in single word sentences .
i 've got 2 younger sisters as well as my older one his mother and he calls my youngest sister ming and he calls me lo he does n't have a name for my other sister yet and just says no no no when he 's asked to say names .
everyone else seems concerned about his speech because he gets frustrated if people do n't understand him .
i try to listen to what he 's saying and ask him if he wants certain things and if i do n't get a yes from him i apologise to him and ask if he can show me .
he 's got a baby sister and she 's babbling and almost talking more than him which raised the concern .
she says mumma nanna dada and yeah almost clearly so it seems less like babbling .
i feel like my nephew is jealous of everyone praising my niece for saying simple things at 9 months old so he does n't wan na talk as much .
it 's kinda sad and i feel bad for him all the time
i 've only seen one image of a senko-kun so have any of you seen any more ?
i 'm editing a video and i 'm almost finished .

i just want to share with u my repair cost
i 've smoked like 20 times now and 18/20 times i feel like my heart is going faster than harriet tubman running away from her owners .
do you prefer racing or just setting better personal times ?
no offense to naruto but his fights are always just spamming shadow clones that get taken out easily getting knocked around and bodied and tossed without landing 1 hit delivers motivational speech then usually with some plot armor delivers a rasengan to the enemy and wins .
literally almost every fight of naruto that 's how he wins .
now i 've said in previous posts that no character has plot armor like sasuke so i agree that sasuke also has plot armor .
however if you ignore the plot armor sasuke has you ca n't deny that he is 1,000 times the fighter and more interesting combatant in all of his fights than naruto ever is .
sasuke brings actual cunning intelligence tactics jutsus and versatility to his fights that make each one of them an entertaining treat to watch because he never just spams the same trick .
the guy is easily one of the most versatile naruto characters and his diverse skill set makes his fights actually fun to watch because there 's variety and creativity we do n't get in naruto fights whether its sasuke 's sick swordsmanship against killer bee taijutsu sequence with orochimaru different lightning style variants against deidara or even shuriken volley against itachi sasuke always manages to try something new for all of his fights and makes his fights unexpected and wildly entertaining .
now i get it in part 1 of naruto naruto could n't have had much versatility in technique since he never had a clan to teach him techniques .
but after naruto spent 3 years with jiraiya training he should have come back with at least more usage and facility with toad summons or maybe even some of jiraiya 's hair jutsu or maybe even the ability to use rasengan in 1 hand .
instead we got a slightly improved naruto with a bigger rasengan and weak genjutsu disruption .
hell even konohamaru developed real techniques in the anime such as his shadow shuriken technique and fire style burning ash jutsu .
the only real new technique naruto ever learns is rasenshuriken while sasuke has like 5 different chidori variants alone chidori chidori razor spear chidori senbon chidori kusanagi blade chidori stream .
even jiraiya a guy that was known to be an idiot like naruto managed to develop real versatile fighting techniques from oil bombs to fire style to even hair jutsu yet naruto still only has shadow clone rasengan and kyuubi cloak as his only powers .
sure he 's powerful but he is n't versatile at all
i ca n't find the following info anywhere on the web hoping you could help me here
i see where it says you can blutooth your music into the machine 's speakers but if i want to run with blutooth headphones and hear the machine 's audio through them instead does that work too ?
what do the 50 workouts that come with the machine look like ?
there is n't a video review out there that shows these at all .
is there a simplistic mode where i can just see my progress around a 1/4 mile track ?
i briefly saw something like this in a video review but they did n't talk about it at all and it was seriously on-screen for maybe three frames of video while they quickly swiped the screen to showcase the classes .
i actually really love just seeing my progress around a 1/4 mile track on some runs so as silly as it sounds to buy this treadmill with it 's huge screen and have that be a major selling point for me it is !
is there a timeout for how long a run can be ?
if there is will it allow a run to continue or force a cool down mode '' ?
i have been on treadmills before with a 60 minute or 100 minute max run timer ...
also totally cool b/c it was my first ever actual build !
do n't worry y'all my own personal build just got finished as well .
wanted to share with you guys because i could n't have done this without this subreddit or pc part picker .
anyone thinking about building for the first time definitely do it .
worse thing that happens as long as you are careful is that you get stuck and you come scour this subreddit or youtube for the answer .

this sub is so full of people sharing stories about how supportive their husbands are being .
is anyone else having trouble connecting or having trouble having necessary conversations or getting support ?
i feel like this is an enormous stressor for both of us and i do n't entirely blame him for being distant but does n't seem to be a story that 's shared on this sub very often .
we talk a lot about our terrible symptoms but it does n't seem like relationship issues are a symptom for many of you .
pick any animal you think you could reasonably keep as a pet this is n't limited to just owl toad or cat .
i noticed some servers are missing a ton of different cars and some tracks .
if i hit the search icon it takes me to a google search that 99 of the times does n't take me to the actual mod .
i may install a car but it wo n't be the right one .
with how many vehicles i 'm missing i feel like it would take hours just to hunt these down to play on one server ... .is there a better way ?
hey so i 'm moving out canada later in the year to try and work on music full time .
over the next few months i 'm going to try and research as much about the indie hip hop scene there learn the lay of the land make connections e.t.c .
does anyone know any music venues in the gta that are underground hip hop friendly and maybe kind of diy my sound is n't the most commercial ?
do not spam outside the subreddit with your codes outside of here .
if you do i will ban you for a month .
if you reply to those other or any other threads with your code i will probably give you a day ban .
i 'm in a predicament which i 'm not sure how to handle .
after i completed an e-learning course and confined water pool dive i received the sdi open water referral however the local dive center that trained me closed a couple weeks after .
i was going to complete the open water dive with them but obviously that ca n't be done so i 'm not sure how it works at this point ?
can i reach out to any other dive center so i can complete my open water certification ?
that is once it is allowed due to the pandemic .
also i hear a lot of different acronyms for the diving instructors .

i made this to try and create a welcoming clan for everyone to join .
all are welcome regardless of level or what not and war will be decided as a clan .
been playing since 2013 and have run five clans in the past
now to preface this im not complaining i 'm not even upset .
but i cant be the only one to find cress a bit underwhelming as the reward .
i mean we got box legends for all other gens yes i know gen 1 had none but come on its mewtwo where are dialga and palkia ?
how many times have dialga and palkia been in the raids anyway .
i missed their first appearances and i have n't seen them since .
i really would love to get my hands on one .
i have a 20yr old chamberlain garage door opener .
about 2 weeks ago we had a storm that knocked out the lights and caused some wind damage .
ever since that storm i ca n't open the garage door using the opener .
i know how to open it by pulling the handle and manually opening it but when i press the button on the hardwired garage door opener the lights just flash 10 times and nothing else .
it does n't even try to open and the motor makes no noise at all .
i 've read this is a common issue when trying to close the garage door because something is blocking the infrared beam or the safety reversing sensors are out of alignment .
this causes the lights to flash when there is an obstruction while trying to close the door .
over the years i 've seen this happen many times before .
i 've never seen it happen when i try to open it though .
to add to the problem when i removed the side cover on the motor to look at the wiring i noticed there is a red button with a small amber led indicator light .
the light will flash 2 times and then there is about a 10 second delay until it flashes twice again .
this happens continuously repeats regardless if i push any buttons .
it never stops unless i unplug the power which i have done but as soon as i plug it back in the light flashes twice and pauses for 10 seconds .
to troubleshoot this i have used a digital tester and a multimeter .
i removed the sensors and attached the alligator clips to the sensors and did a continuity test .
then i attached the clips to the wires coming from the motor and they each passed a continuity test also .
i read that the sensors have lights on them that indicate if they are in alignment but neither of them will light up .
i removed the sensors and attached them directly to the motor to see if they would at least light up and they do n't .
is there any other troubleshooting i can do before i replace it ?
i just hate the idea that maybe it 's something simple that i 'm missing but at this point my guess is it 's either the logic control board or the motor itself .
i am willing to trade her for marshal preferably or raymond if possible c
i f 22 was in a relationship m 23 for 3 years over the entire time i was in college .
we had a relationship that was far from perfect but did try to communicate as best as possible .
we each had our own traumas and tended to take out stressors on the other .
i think looking back on it it was pretty codependent and unhealthy .
we both graduated and i left the country to serve in the peace corps .
we had decided that we were going to stay in a relationship but switch to an open relationship .
over the course of the three month training he called to discuss his sexual conquests .
and though it did hurt that was what we agreed on .
and i 'd agreed to always be his friend above everything .
after i 'd finished training we talked about once a week .
he stopped saying i love you and somehow i do n't think it was a big thing .
i should have known that that 's when our relationship ended .
but we still kept talking sometimes it was challenging to connect but we tried to schedule good times to talk with the time difference different work schedules and the cellular data connections of a developing country .
fast forward to march and i realize that the interactions we 're having and the emotional space that we use to have for each other is no longer there .
i 'm the only one sharing emotional things and the only one making effort to call .
that 's the moment i realized that we had n't had a loving relationship for over 6 months .
i 'm totally taking responsibility for my part clearly if it took so long for me to realize i was n't paying close enough attention .
unfortunately this is the same time that all of the peace corps volunteers were evacuated .
so not only did i not have the time to have this conversation but additionally my emotional space for processing things was thrown upside down .
since getting back we 've occasionally shared stuff on social media but never really chatted .
i reached out to him a few weeks ago to suggest going on a hike i 'm not sure why and actually immediately regretted it but that lead to a small discussion on perhaps discussing the end of everything and closure .
i was n't surprised with how our relationship ended after taking some time to reflect .
i am sad that he was n't capable of bringing it up and being direct about it ending it .
he reached out to me today and shared some recent news articles that pertained to my degree and thought i 'd find them educational given i 'd studied the subject at school.
he then went on to explain his sadness and opinions on the topic .
i struggled to begin with because the subject was something that i 'd tried to talk with him about before and he 'd always shut it down .
he 'd never listen to the most recent information on the subject or the different opinions of the experts .
i 'd never claim to be an expert as i 'm not but i also know that i have a lot more experience with the subject than he does .
additionally when i was direct and expressed this frustration he lashed back and encouraged me to grow up .
he suggested that maybe we do n't talk again except potentially to find closure .
or can i just leave it and move on ?
and one more thing ... how do you know if you 're over a relationship ?
i 'm clearly not in the best mental health space sudden evacuation other familial relationship problems etc but i 'm struggling to understand my feelings on this amongst everything else .
i do have text messages if that would be more explanatory as well .
tldr is an official we 're broken up this is why actually necessary ?
how do you identify emotions from one challenge when they 're mixed in with a few others ?
ima be honest i never thought i 'd need a buddy for this game ngl but being a solo is kinda difficult and boring so i 'd rather play with someone

i feel like inasa and the other students from different schools could have helped in some way in this current arc .
i just feel like after their arc they havent been in the story at all and they have a high potential to be amazing characters maybe even just showing what agency he went to would be enough
i have never been into mediating but i have to say headspace has been giving me a lot of peace the last couple of weeks .
i got a dm once from a 19 yr old on here asking for my snap for 5 and i told him i 'd only give it to him for 50
looking back i shoulda taken the 5 and ran whooops
but few of us know the extent of the work required to build it or about the years of complex planning that will have taken place .
it 's like people ca n't cough now even when it 's necessary to clear their throat or something else fairly harmless people glare at you and are like omg you walking plague carrier you 're gon na infect and kill us all in 48 hours .
okay so awhile back i got rid of mk the game was in a garbage state .
i saw they were about to bring back my girl sheeva and wondered if the premium addiction of mk the one that included the kp covers aftermath or do i have to buy it as a separate thing .
my sister came in about an hour and a half ago and talked with me about random things going on in her life from the past two days .
she came outside with me to smoke and we started talking about our future education plans .
eventually we started talking about the gre exam graduate record examinations and she started reading the information online .
she kept talking about how much she hated geometry even though she 's great at every other kind of math .
something was so funny about her talking about how much she disliked geometry .
she held up pictures of triangles on her phone menacingly as she explained that she 's positive the few math questions she missed on the sat were geometry questions .
it was an insignificant moment but it made me happy for some reason and i wanted to share .
all its brought to me is pain dispair and heartache .
i 'm on a realm with some buddy 's and we 're endgame .
one of us is building this mega storage system in our main compound area and it significantly reduced frame rate standing in it and it 's not even finished .
we 're not gon na rebuild it in survival .
the only option we can come up with is moving the build via commands but that might be pushing our limitations we set creative only for asthetics .

my proposed business partner bp and i decided in october 2019 to start an ohio company that we were splitting 50/50 .
he also claimed that in x amount of years it would be totally mine .
before this i worked as his 2 at a shop in va this was all verbal he does n't put things in writing .
we formed the corporation and filed the initial articles of incorporation .
we started with 100 shares in the company and there have been no stocks issued yet .
in january i negotiated a deal with an investor .
the investor decision was discussed and agreed upon with my bp .
we agreed to give him 20 for 100k 10 from me and 10 from the bp to keep us even .
so i move to ohio at the end of february and start setting up the shop .
i find a location sign the lease get the ffl .
i put in flooring painted the walls installed slatwall bought all of our necessary machinery set up our pos system etc ... at this point i have invested 45k of my own money with next to nothing coming from the bp .
there are still no corporate agreements or documents signed to this day i know i 'm an idiot .
then 2-3 weeks ago my bp changed all of the original verbal agreements .
at first he said he only wanted a slight majority equity to secure his future investments .
he said his attorney would send over his thoughts that never happened .
so i sent him the documents that the attorney who is representing the company had drafted from the original agreement of 50/50 .
everything was pretty standard and even it did n't even mention the investor yet .
he responded poorly and screamed on the phone at me a couple of times .
i 'm refusing to come off of our original verbal agreement it 's too late in the game and i 've invested too much of my own to lose equity to somebody who has invested almost nothing .
never should have gone into business with him from the start ...
this is his stance now i will retain complete majority control of this corp or i will do everything in my power to go to war with whoever gets in my way.
he is independently wealthy and has threatened to destroy every fiber of my being. i 'm not worried that he 'll come after me physically but i am worried he will drain my finances in litigation if it gets there .
i 've been advised to go ahead and file the company in my name 100 and let him try to prove ownership .
he lives in va and has only been to ohio once .
at which time he also told my mother we will be 50/50 partners as well .
i guess i do n't have a specific question i 'm just looking for advice and strategies of how to proceed .
i 'll be happy to give any additional and necessary info to whoever takes interest .
i move to ohio to start building shop with my money

it seems like we 've gotten to the point with technology where online services like facebook and youtube have become so large and complex that they cease being competitive business and just sort of integrate as a standard part of modern society .
because we have natural processes that explains what we do know .
you have asserted that we know god did n't create the universe how are you substantiating this claim ?
furthermore let 's take an example prior to the big bang we do n't have current measurements that tells us anything about it .
but that does n't mean i 'm going to jump the gun and claim god did it .
fine but do n't delude yourself into thinking you 're more intellectually honest than people who believe in god .
if we knew categorically what had occurred prior to the big bang it still would not disprove the existence of god .
yeah he had his screen up the entire time .
i knew from the first few minutes into the appetizers that there probably would n't be a second date .
that was only confirmed after he answered that phone call .

taste yes see nutrition value depends on if you value the nutrition huel uses what are generally perceived as higher quality ingredients and is a competitive price imo .
those ingredients render the texture close to unusable for me personally .
certainly not a shake i look forward to like i do soylent .
used as a weight gainer on top of whole foods you already eat ?
for 3000k a day you might prefer huel for better overall macros .
send me a chat with what you have and what you 'd like from me ?
everything tastes the same as the original but instead of rice it is tri color quinoa i think so it is a little nuttier '' and has the quinoa texture but the leaves oil etc .

i will add it frees up the cpu by moving the data de-compression off the cpu and over to their custom i/o which is the equivalent of 9 zen cores .

i 'm pretty thick skinned so i do n't really care but perhaps you could think about being less condescending when talking about/to people on the internet ?
some people 's self esteem is low to begin with and comments like this can really hurt them .
no group like lgbt or minorities should have more benefits or rights than another group .
so you believe in gay marriage and combating institutionalized racism .

to be honest i tend to go looking at historical figures for inspiration .
if i run out of real people from the era then i look to fiction from the era .
i do n't so much make the real people and fictional characters so much as model characters on them .
do n't try and pass this off as not edited op i see the fuzzy outline of the sniper that comes from the quick selection tool .

you may want to occassionally air out the garage and especially after about 6-7pm when the air cools a bit .
if the garage is significantly hotter than your house it 's actively working against your ac and making the house more difficult to cool .
ideally you want the garage attic etc no hotter than the outside air otherwise it 's radiating heat into the home .
i especially love it with the extreme habanero cheese and additional hot sauce on it ... although i was n't raised in columbus i did live there for 12 years .
it 's super common to feel how you 're feeling .
non-binary covers so many different kinds of experiences and expression that seeing someone else with the same label but vastly different feelings can be jarring .
just know that there is no one way to be nb there are no requirements you have to meet and your identity feelings and experiences are unique to you .

my mini schnauzer mix rescue was terrified of our pool until i made him comfortable in the water .
once the weather gets warm enough to swim he loves to dive into the water to fetch his toys !
it sucks having someone that close to you be so special yet unavailable .
i had this one girl myself who i was very close with and would always spend time with but i was so scared to let her know my true feelings .
i lived alone for a while in my apartment and i think the depressing state of my life was getting to her as well .
i started to think that we were n't meant to be until i finally one day got a surprise from her .
she bought me a pet bunny rabbit for my birthday .
it was literally the most the most sweet thing ever .
it was probably 20 pounds hige for a rabbit ! !
and we ended up naming it pick-chu together a reference to my favorite band .
one day i asked her if my feelinys for her were alright and she finally said yes and we went on a a date the next day .
when on the date she asked me a very strange qwestion she said would you ever consider having childeren ? .
she then threw a hissy fit and then i ssaid maybe on one condision .
if wwe can have secks. then she said no and i was sad she broeke up with me ! ! ! '
when i got home thethe bunny named pick-chu'literally got up on its hind legs and became a furry .
he came in my but and i then i cried .
your posting in a reddit thread full of react native developers
but ive work in a flutter project just previously yes the learning curve is there but the flutter is a winner when it comes to their reusable widgets as there are plethora of widgets thats built in their framework .
also i dont trust google when it comes to vision and their goal .
and also hate their flutter web i think that wont succced much .
react native is a winner for me when it comes to styling customizing per platform and also if coming from a webdev background transition is very easy .
both are recommended for mobile development theres no real winner here its just developers are the real winners d
speaking of dc 's mystic side there was actually talks about a live action adaptation of justice league dark taking place in the dceu but it just became one of those cancelled projects and as far as how dceu goes it would be a better idea for jld to work as a standalone movie .
if he is a good player which it seems he was not he could have pulled his weight .
this weeks challenge is easy it 's barely a difference to a regular insane mission .
people here even recommended simply going in with a medic anyway .
sure that recommendation was with combat medic in mind which a lvl 1 wo n't have but still its far from unwinnable .
a map on insane with the 50 mod is still easier than a run on extreme certainly doable with competent lvl 1s .
i prefer to look at it this way if i worry about how bad others are then i will be unhappy all day long .
there is nothing i can do about it if i want to play random queue then accepting it is the only option .
if i instead focus on what i can do to carry the run regardless of which mistakes others make i can learn improve and enjoy my own success especially with the added difficulty of being handicapped by random teammates that do silly things .
in this situation i would try to focus on why i was n't able to dodge the bull and how to avoid situations like that in the future .
not on how teammates were bad at getting me out of it .
oh definitely that 's one of the thing i liked about the game how clearly it demonstrated that .
you have n't played the game and therefore do n't know crap
i think that a huge part of people who complain about smurfs do n't complain because they think that smurfs prevent them from climbing .
it just ruins the game for then fun wise .
sure winning is fun and losing is anti fun but i 've had so many games that were fun over all despite losing .
and games that i absolutely hated every second of despite winning .
getting smurfs in your games can suck the fun out of them really quick .
and pointing out that smurfs make the game unfun to play is like pointing out that certain champs make the game unfun to play if they 're not banned .
it 's simply pointing out to riot where the current system is failing or creating situations that suck for most people in them .
and the frequency of the posts might reflect the frequency of that happening .
if we only ever had one post with one person complaining about smurfs everyone would ignore it and move on .
but if the posts do n't stop coming and their number and frequency actually increases that 's a clear sign that somethings wrong .

you need to create a base in your first few months of lifting .
contrary to what some may say you do n't need volume right now .
try a linear progression program starting strength sl maybe ivysaur and eat at a caloric surplus .
increasing your squat and deadlift will help put more muscle on you .
it will be boring at the beginning and hell towards the end but once you create your strength base then do ppl .

i have restarted the game client twice for good measure .
at this point i can only conclude that either the game is really bugged on xp gains or it is updating previous math error by adding xp here and there .

that 's because some versions of firmware prevent you from downgrading to prevent protocol mismatches like this .
your best bet is the assistant 2 app on your pc .
the controller has a usb port is there anyway to somehow downgrade the firmware through a usb drive ?
only the phantom 3 gl300a model could do this .
all other remotes update via pc or the dji go app .

australia 's democracy is one of great considerable and significant respect .
we have compulsory voting for example which means that citizens are required to become engages in the political system every few years .
we also mandate full preferential voting in both chambers of our federal parliament and most state and territory parliaments .
mr. speaker it is a shame that the government is attempting to subvert this country 's great democracy with respect to the australian national anthem .
when that question was put to the voters of this country the opposition assumed that the government were acting in good faith .
when the riley cabinet told us that they would implement the result of the plebiscite we believed them and the country believed them .
they created a new song that nobody asked for and nobody voted for and declared it the interim anthem .
only after polling showed that less than one in five australians supported it did they reverse course .
the government 's new delay and deflect tactic was to form an australian anthem council which has hardly done anything in its current state of operation .
anybody with any sense can see that the government does not want to implement the new anthem because they do n't support the winning song .
the government would rather use taxpayer money to fund an inactive and unhelpful council which does nothing but delay the inevitable transfer of our anthem than concede defeat and allow the anthem to be changed .
the treasurer claims that he is the ‘biggest advocate for democracy ' and then attempts to shut down this debate .
i 'm unsure of whether the member for cowper is aware of the hypocrisy of his own words .
democracy works when elected officials foster and support it and mean it when they say that they will foster and support it .
mr. speaker the government should reflect on its position with regards to the anthem council .
they should also ask themselves whether they are doing all that is in their power to protect the will of the people because i doubt that those people would say so .
it 's like some kind of promo photo for degrassi the college years
i tried to kill myself multiple times and yet i 'm still here .
i ca n't even begin to tell you how devastating it was to see my parents ' faces after they 'd found out that i 'd cut myself and that i 'm bleeding out .
think as you wish and please remember i used the word assume '' for four different conditions .
either way i know that time value of money '' is a well known concept that i am right and that you are wrong in thinking that it is never worth it to finance anything that you can pay for outright '' .
to be clear this is not really about who is right or wrong and more about the actual statement that you brought up which is wrong .
i 'm genuinely not trying to be disrespectful and/or offensive .
i am simply just trying to educate you as to why you 're wrong so that you can optimize your future finances as this subreddit should be used for conversations of value to correct others and/or to educate others .
if you refuse to accept it that 's fine and i sincerely wish you well .
however note that i have many upvotes even though this is not indicative that i am right but it is more likely that i am right since others understand and agree with what i have articulated .
straight out of college given the cost of living yes .
even for a tech job at least given the area .
i would expect that for someone at 3 to 5 years experience in the industry but that 's damn good for starting out .
i ran it through a col calculator and that would be around 130k a year in new york .
most people who 've lived in large cities not in the midwest their entire lives really do n't grasp how cheap it is to live outside of the coasts
would n't they just have to add whatever to the fuel and then only a small amount of people would have to be in the know
sometimes there is a delay but 5 days does seem like much .
i would reach out on discord and ask there .
once south africa cools off namibia will begin negotiations with surrounding nations .
slowly upgraded and it 's cheap af since i got a great deal on the cooler .
i mean specifically about getting a return i 'm out of my micro center window .
i may have to do an rma through amd but just wondering if there was any other band aid .
there are people who are frugal and there are people who are just downright cheap .
maybe there 's no effort since popular streaming services barely offer a platform for artwork .
the listener used to literally get a giant cardboard square with artwork on the front back and inside with lyrics and credits ... .
if they applied this concept to some features we 'd actually have a solid platform for artists to release their art .
this is n't even a point worth arguing about but if you actually love and appreciate music you know spotify is a bad service and does n't give the artists or listeners enough for what something like a record or cd offers .
yeah this may not be something everyone wants but it 's better than what we 're dealing with now with this oversimplified ui .
the ground war hackers i reported muted blocked and some accepted my friend request so i can keep tabs on them are still playing daily/weekly .
those who were premuted not on friends list still in gw games when i was doing sniper scopes reticles still cheating .
activision needs to focus on hackers in mp as well .
replying to myself to add that she said this on twitter https twitter.com/shauna_m_ahern/status/1265385134640922624 soooo
it 's time for people to stop saying they are not racist if they take racist actions .
i assumed the previous reference to metal working was industrial process manufacturing .
bending cutting moving and joining items in bulk to engineer specs .
not a ‘skilled ' job but not to say it does n't require skills .
i 've seen the types of videos you 're referring to .
my displayed queue times are n't ant better but if i queue all roles i get out onto dps ocassionally .
if the tag price is 29.98 you pay 30 here
yes they do multiple shootings and cop on black guy deaths lately .
and that does n't make a whole lotta sense with powell 's beef injections .
although processors differ in various ways most software does n't take that into account .
so whether you 're running amd or intel does n't matter if the software was written without taking advantage of instructions built into each processor .
only up to chapter 4 but loving it so far
i think yes you do have to go into the menu and change the setting although sometimes i think i 've put in a different region disc and it works but i do n't know if that 's me misremembering though .
nevertheless it 's no issue at all to just quickly change the setting and watch the film well worth it to watch whatever you want from wherever you get it .
hyper music i generally prefer high energy songs of course both are good but that 's my favourite of the two
it was reposted to r/prequelmemes like a day ago the original is from either that sub or r/clonewarsmemes but i 'm having a hard time finding it .
in general a good rule of thumb is if you did n't make it it 's a repost .
that 's true for reform and new-age judaism but a lot of orthodox communities arent like that .
do n't get me wrong personally i think that what 's wrong is that some religious communities require circumcision at all .
in my opinion that 's the thing that 's messed up here .
but at the moment that is indeed the case in some situations
to clarify i think that it 's wrong that parents should be forced to make that decision for their infant child but in some cases that is a decision that parents have to make and both options have repercussions for the child
l'unico cod che ti permette di fare una cosa del genere è aw ... con il gioco in italiano puoi selezionare l'inglese spagnolo portoghese francese e tedesco ... bellissimo ahah
i like olives on my pizza and in a subway sandwich but when i see someone eat a whole olive like from a martini or in a salad for some reason that grosses me out .
i play with it off but i see many people with it on even when they are generally really good at the game .
i agree but scoring a sitter '' is n't nearly as easy as it seems .
it takes a lot of clever movement anticipation timing and understanding of the game to escape the defense particularly a good one and get in the position for a tap-in .
if scoring tap-ins was so easy you 'll never have strikers going on a goal droughts .
and when someone like ronaldo scores insane amounts of sitters '' you understand it 's actually his movement and talent that allows him to pop up at those positions every time .
not sure if applicable but it 's possible to get a 1700 from aliexpress for 110usd
fun fact btw hitlers artworks go unsold on an auction last year
thats kinda sad really must be quite boring when you ca n't joke about race .
are you suggesting that other races than white joking about race are also racists ?
people outside of this circle say shit with no feeling and it 's like damn watch your mouth ! ''
do n't know why people think that file uploading is a basic feature there 's bandwidth issues overhead etc .
whereas gifs tags are managed discord-side and have their own rate limits .
my advanced cad course for t3 was cancelled and i 'm devastated .
eh i 'm going to go against what everyone else says and say you should do it .
maybe not tinder but just some dating app in general .
hinge was getting popular just when i stopped using dating apps .
you just got to go into it with low expectations but you 're young and decently good looking .
follow whatever the current recommendations are for best bio/types of pics and you 'll probably have better success than much of reddit .
just understand that getting matches is fairly low probability getting dates is rarer and getting sex and/or a girlfriend is like winning a small lottery .
playing the lottery can be fun just do n't let it ruin your life .
the rewards for winning are hella worth it though .
honestly if you really pay attention to her on the season this kind of is n't that left field .
she us from vb and has country girl type vibes minus being extremely fashionable .
i do n't really think the shyness was an act although definitely driven by insecurity .
i never saw her as someone who would move to la and go full influencer .
i get the feel that like caelynn once she is in a legit relationship she would be a totally different person .
okay that was super cringy but that seems like a massive overreaction .
literally every teenager with a goth phase went to a graveyard to take dumb pictures does n't deserve all this shit at all .
edit i went to check on french twitter cause curiosity .
and people are literally advocating for i quote ' attach her arms and legs and throw her in a fucking river ' .
in what world dancing on a grave is worse than saying this about a kid ?
humans are basically unchanged biologically since we moved out of africa .
sure there 's mutations here and there like pale skin or red hair but everything that makes us human is the same .
so why is one group over there any more or less of an animal than another group over there ?
bro do you know which type of paint used on ms bakugan on their silver or alternative that can use to do some touch up
i think you are missing the conversion part of this whole thread .
usually you do n't have to convert from what you are and want because an out of date book told your parents that it 's wrong to be gay .
the real danger is choking on said dry sandwich .

i just started the epilogue and i felt empty .
i ca n't find the clip right now but he mentioned it a few times .
he 'd occasionally get questions from major network reporters on how he managed to get some particular clip from an old speech or the like .
his answer was that when a politician said something that did n't quite ring true to their history he had interns trolling through old video tape of floor speeches interviews etc .
that is huge and shows you are a really strong person .
not hating just curious as to why it actually did .
i am like jon snow when it comes to this stuff so i am just genuinely curious
regarding gpu i 've just upgraded to rtx 2070s from 1660s and can say that the 1660s is a pretty capable gpu .
i ran any of the tomb raider games as well as battlefield v on ultra with all the bells whistles turned on never had a single hiccup during play .
with that said though i 'd go with the 2060 to get into rtx land if you could spare the extra dough i 'd even recommend going 2070 even though it 's a stretch from the 1660s the 2070s is the better-action-for-the-buck purchase

a daunting blend of fresno and carolina reapers but the heat is not serious .
a lot of vinegar and a great flavor great for chips .
neolibs are the biggest centrists out there for the simple fact that neoliberalism is the status quo and the ideology of the establishment .
so anyone who espouses neoliberalism is for the status-quo and the establishment and thus a clear centrist .

i think why aethists dont like the word god is because it has to do with man made religion and laws you have to abide by .
this has caused wars and bloodshed for thousands of years .
i believe in a greater force but for some reason i dont want to call it god just my take on it .
i think it 's a combination of your internet and the fact everyone is stuck at home constantly using theirs some companies handle it better than others i 'm having the same issues .

for anyone who disagrees with this sofia has literally gotten away with doing absolutely nothing while always being the one who everyone liked more .
i honestly applaud alex for how she handled everything .
i think it got messy at times but she came out on top because she did n't play dirty as sofia did .
it honestly sounds like sofia never cared about anything other than the money and fame that chd brought her .
it was alex who was n't about to let chd escape because of greed .
alex deserves to call sofia out for her shady actions she literally allowed sofia to put her boyfriend above everything and covered for her only to have sofia literally stab her in the back in the end .

their learning paths break things down to the very basic os through specific tool training .
well you 're just straight wrong because you can in fact work around 10 hours without it affecting your benefit .

adhd found in up to 50 of autistic people and my focus is terrible
i used to play the flute piccolo and sing now i can barely breathe comfortably !
when i was sick with no test c19 i was down to 250 and less .
when i started a few weeks before i got very sick my peak flow went from 350 to 400-450 .
which suggests to me that the inhaler was definitely working .
but right now it fluctuates depending upon how ill i am again .
currently i am fighting off oral thrush i have a weird rash on my back looks a bit like mild chicken pox but it 's on both sides of my spine although more focused on my right side .
if it was totally one sided i could be convinced it was shingles but both sides ? ?
it is stinging and now the white pus spots have gone down they are just red circular scabs .
i had chicken pox 3 times as a child but was confirmed immune when i applied for a job at a hospital about a decade ago .
as i mentioned above my liver is n't good but seems to be healing well .
i am itchy and my skin is peeling badly all over my hair is falling out my mouth was full of ulcers but then i got thrush so it 's metallic slime instead now well the thrush medicine which is nicer than slime ! ...
my eyes keep going blurry my nails are bending my body hair is falling out too under my eyes and my gums are very pale ... my nose and gums are bloody when i knock them gently or brush my teeth ... it all feels just like malnutrition .
so last year i was in a big hospital away from home another county with amazing treatment and staff ... being tube fed .
first nasojejunal blocked/kinked puked the second one up and the third one was too late my intestines were so sick and i was so weak i could n't manage more than tiny drips of fluid and i was in agony .
i needed tpn so i had a picc put in and had tpn for two weeks .
the only time i can ever remember not having abdominal pain .
i kind of wanted to bring it home if i am honest .
but i knew it was very high risk and one of the consultants was really hard to communicate with .
anyway ... after coming off that i got septic with a kidney infection i told them i needed fluids and they did n't listen told me to keep trying to drink but everything was coming back up ...
i should probably have put in a formal complaint but i was too tired and sick to care ...
i recovered after being pumped full of iv fluids and antibiotics and then was able to go home on oral food and water .
i told them when i left that was it .
i will come back for appointments but with my ptsd being triggered so badly and my youngest child being so traumatised i wo n't do it again .
almost a year exactly and i start puking so bad i ca n't keep fluids down .
but just lay down at home and keep trying .
2 days later i manage to break it and get something in .
but with a decent course of cipro managed to beat that at home too .
tomorrow morning 7hrs away i have blood tests at my local clinic to see how i am doing .
because i have all the signs of malnutrition again i have lots and lots of infections from things that should n't be able to infect me .
i am sleeping even more than usual i have no appetite my prescription supplements are making me sick i am struggling with fluids ...
but at the same time unless they agree to sedate me for the whole time there is no way i will cope mentally with being an inpatient again .
i nearly killed myself every single night i was there last year .
i had plans and knew exactly what i was going to do .
i mean i am no stranger to those feelings but i know plans are my big danger sign .
is there any kind of iv stuff at home ?
can i insist that they treat me at home ? ?
or if i tried for say a hickman line and then went back in daily to learn to use it and flush it ... would that be an option ? ?
otherwise i guess the only real option is to wait until i get sick enough to faint/become unconscious ?
and then they can admit me against my will as long as my husband agrees which he would because he would like me alive .
i would like to say i am very mentally safe right now i have a very supportive husband .
i am supposed to have a care coordinator but with the pandemic i do n't have anyone now .
but i am still safe and have access to emergency mental health services .
my diet mostly consists of sugars white bread and a little lean protein when i can manage that a couple of times a week .
i ca n't manage fats whole grains fibre nor vegetables nor fruit .
i am already seeking medical help i just want to know if there are any options for home nutrition that bypass the stomach really ?
my medications are potent and a weird mix but i have spent years working through various options with doctors to find a balance that is most effective so while i am open to suggestions if it 's a medication i have probably already tried it and had unbearable side effects it 's unavailable here or there is another reason it wo n't work .
feel free to mention it but also be aware my doctors and i have spent years together trying to get things this bearable .
in this essay i will give a brief look at what the lock down has done but mostly it will be on my own experience .
i 'm sure every person will lock at this and give you all the facts and niche details .
you will get the main facts but i thought why not deliver my own experience .
it is n't that interesting to most but i deal with my own problems and i know people who have the same problems as me so why not talk about it ?
covid 19 is a killer in all different ways not just in its natural form as a virus .
first we are going to look at the confirmed cases then the deaths covid 19 has redeemed for its tally chart .
in the world from the 26th of may a staggering 5,589,626 people have been infected .
350,453 that 's how many people have caught covid 19 and not survived .
1 in 10 people who have been in contact with covid 19 have ultimately died .
cases a day its growing and growing all around the world .
everyone must stay safe do n't be arrogant or single minded .
we are humans we have survived this long because we are the smartest nucleus on this planet !
why throw away generations for our own greed and pleasure ?
the uk has one of the highest amounts of cases compared to any other country apart from the u.s being at the top .
with deaths we actually hold a mortality rate higher that 10 like the average for the world we are hitting 15 with 37,460 deaths .
the u.s on the other hand have the highest confirmed cases but less than 10 death rate with 101 thousand pronounced dead .
if we acted quicker and behave better today we as a nation will prevail over this virus a lot sooner .
in today 's world we must think of overs a lot more .
the effects this horrific disease has done besides confirming more confirmed cases .
the well being of our family and friends should be the reason why we are staying safe .
now think of the of the people who do not have the luxury of having a family or a friend to talk too .
some humans can live like this very easily its in their nature its how they are as people its easy for them .
the people who struggle with mental diseases and have no one in this very lonely time need the support of our community .
we need to be checking on each other we need to ask if everyone is okay leaving a quick message or have a phone call can do a lot for anyone who suffers .
staying safe in this troubling time is key for our health .
what are we all doing for our mental health ?
encourage evolvement in social activities online or however you see fit that 's safe .
we do n't know where it will take us .
my own experience of how i am dealing with the covid 19 lock down .
i 'll like to start with the process of me injure .
not only has my injure hindered my army career its finished it as well .
i was getting the best treatment i could for my shoulder the army have given the physios time to give me a chance at recovery .
the process of recovery had its ups and downs but with not much progress i given another shot .
the rru clinic in aldershot wanted me to attend which for a recruit never happens .
with some learning of the body and mind with intense sessions attacking my shoulder we learnt a fair bit .
here comes covid 19. near the end of the course covid 19 hit and everything started to shut down i again was given another opportunity to head to stanmore but was halted .
the progress that would have been made in stanmore could have been enough for me .
we will never know purely because of the lack of judgement of covid 19 .
the act was not quick and the foresight was cloudy peoples lives have been crushed because of these actions .
my rehab at home is purely based off my own accord from now and my job has been snatched because i cant proceed quick enough .
i do n't have the facility 's or team to help me keep this job .
covid 19 took away my progress and chance of staying .
i blame covid 19 for ruining my chances with a career now which is n't healthy .
with a back round of a lot of change a chance at doing something important and meaningful meant a lot to me .
when i could n't complete training and was moved to gold it cut deep but i was focused to keep going .
given different opportunities to progress but all failed because i was n't able too .
this injure has been with me for over 6 moths now we was just figuring it all out and then covid 19 came to kick me back down .
dealing with this injure alone and knowing that no progress has happened this will lead to my contract being terminated .
covid 19 is a killer virus and a mental health destroyer .
people need the interaction and comfort of others but in a safe manner .
she 's original no gifts and no changes to her catchphrase .
i have some items for sale and would prefer to sell local in the bay area 94513 but would be open to opening it up for paypal and shipping .
my cpu and mobo have already been sold and these parts remain .
it may take me a few extra days to make it down to the post office if we go that route .
do n't really have the need for any trades at this time .
let me know if any of these prices seem off based on current trends .
not sure what type of die it is my typhoon burner wo n't load .

edit please comment and then pm but an actual pm not chat .
i do n't have access to chat on my mobile app .
okay so being an 'adult ' in student accommodation i often find myself wondering about the level of life skills that are taught but that is generally limited too wondering how the hell you burn pasta or did no one ever tell you not to microwave an egg .
so due to everything there is only four of us in my flat .
myself 23f and my three flatmates a=25f b=21m and c=19m .
last night i cooking and talking to a and b about relationships when b mentioned something about his girlfriend wanting to get a long distance adult toy because she 's at her parents now .
he was confused because he could n't figure out how they work we assumed he meant like logistically but no .
turns out my 21m flatmate did not know what a clitoris was and assumed that women only felt pleasure from things going up this made for an awkward conversation .
not sure what made me post this except maybe for our fellow womankind to pray for his girlfriend if his knowledge of female anatomy is as bad i think .
i have been playing dayz on the game pass for xbox one and on the last day of my game pass i decided to buy the full game .
ever since the when i try to play i try to join a server and it take me to a grey screen and it loads for a second and takes me back to the main screen .
i 've been out of skating for quite sometime .
last i saw palace 5ive closed a few years back where i got my first board
i found my old board and skated at an empty school near me for quite some time to get my feel for riding again .
any stores still open and any places worth checking out to learn ?
i know freedom plaza is a place people skate but there 's always cops and i 'm fairly new and do n't wan na risk it
is it lame to admit that this is the best day of my life so far ?
i 've been replaying something goes right '' by sbtrkt nonstop because it perfectly sums up my journey .
anyway it looks like this will be my last post in lsa so great luck ♥️♥️♥️ and peace from me and my various pseudonyms .
edit wow thank you all so much for the support !
i told my 6yo son we 'd rehab it .
i went to a local reptile place for advice and they said it was best to release it .
i felt guilty that i 'd come home empty handed so the reptile place suggested an inexpensive easy care '' anole ... who was housed with tree frogs ... which i decided i liked .
i setup the aquarium with coconut fiber on the bottom moss on top lots of moisture a few wooden objects screen top .
on the third morning there was a deep fluffy layer of white mold covering everything !
i have chronic lung disease/breathing issues so panic bought a new terrarium and substrate ... a kit from a big box pet supply store actually .
also because i 'd started researching these two little guys i also got mister .
another 300 spent for these inexpensive easy care '' pets .
after even more research i 'm not even a week in i 'm learning a little about bioactive and real plants and mold/mushrooms .
even if it was an uneducated impulse buy i want to do what 's best for these little guys without bothering my breathing for my son .
i 'd love real plants for them and have started to propagate an existing pothos i have .
i 'm gathering i need layers on the bottom not just coconut .
i left out the moss out of fear of mold but my tree frog seems disgruntled by that !
i realize the anole and the tree frog prefer slightly different environments so i have a tall terrarium 18x18x20 so i have space to do dual zones if possible .
there 's so much info and slightly different recommendations for the two species ... could someone possibly help me with the absolute basics i need to do to keep us all happy and healthy ?
first time posting on reddit outside of a few comments and i 'm mobile apologies if anything is n't proper !
since my flying eagle f5s eclipse came with rockerable frames i decided to try it out .
but i did n't realize how much more responsive it would be !
i could make turns on a dime and manoeuvre with ease !
it was a bit unstable when going faster but it was n't anything unmanageable .
i just might keep my frames rocked at this point .
did they use other things simillar to a piping bag ?
or did they use something more like a chocolate paste or fondant .
i 've been using the universal stan 's stems for a while .
they 're okay but now that i 'm building a new wheelset i 'm trying to see what else is out there and worth trying .
i could get a crack head screaming at people is stressful but a skeleton drunkingly spilling grape juice is the equivalent of taking school finals because ... ?

i have tried googling this but all i got was how to get your dog to pee in the rain '' but my question is is it even right to take dogs out while it 's raining ?
we get some bad rains here where it will pour for multiple days in a row till water actually starts collecting on the streets and i can not imagine taking my puppy out in that weather .
he is only 4.5 months old now and is just getting used to the idea of doing all his business outside and typically requires 2-3 mins to be done .
imagine spending 2 mins getting soaked to the bone .
the only solution i can think of is a doggy raincoat but what 's everyone else doing ?
basically when i am trying to sleep it keeps getting brighter and brighter until i eventually need to open my eyes to remind my eyes that it is indeed dark in my bedroom .
it gets to the point where even sleeping with a cover over my eyes does n't help .
seeing as this is the premiere ice cream subreddit with so many fellow ice cream lovers i am coming to you here for help .
normally i get peanut butter ice cream at a local ice cream place but because of covid my ice cream store is closed .
so where do i go to get my precious peanut butter ice cream ?
i do n't want to spend too much money so if it could be free that would be great .
i am looking to get a sphinx to put next to my museum .

any help would be greatly appreciated and i apologize if this post is n't allowed .
i 've been lurking around the subreddit for a few weeks and i was wondering if anyone has a dupe of sugarful by michel germain ?
i 've seen the ad floating around and i absolutely love the idea of it !
i asked in the unofficial discord sometime ago and got recommended a few scents by cocoapink but i was looking for more options as cocoapink indeed had a few cotton candy scents but none i found to be very close to what 's listed in the sugarful notes .
i heard about andrei almost 6 months ago through a youtube channel that i frequent and today i saw a poster for his film solaris on the sub r/movieposterporn and decided to rent it for tonight because i loved the poster so much and i knew that he was a reputable director .
it just got me wondering what people consider to be his magnum opus .
i really wish a lot of concepts had been flushed out more in this new trilogy .
basically there is a cult worshiping the darkside in an inaccessible uncharted area of the galaxy .
an entire planet has been dedicated to the breeding of this cult to be wholly loyal and they worship not just darth sidious the man but a much greater eternal liniage of sith lords who constantly combine in the new dark lord .
they live on a world covered by supernatural lightning storms in a giant upside-down topless floating pyramid .
in the caves beneath this pyramid is the remnant of ancient like millenia old ritual chambers and such including a huge audience chamber and the throne of the sith .
the loyalists chant and gibber seeming semi human but not exactly and never speaking a known language or being captioned .
in fact they use and speak an ancient language of hideous runes that the republic made illegal to even translate .
i could go on but either you 've seen the movie or probably are n't going to haha .
here is an example of kylo ren locating the planet https youtu.be/ht7hsafpqiw

and where ever you look the private market always beats the public market in prices and efficiency .
the postal services has high wages for unskilled jobs which you pay for .
you may not see the prices reflected in the usps but they are there just hidden in the taxes that everyone pays .
a problem with this is you are forced to pay the tax to the usps even if you have never shipped anything in your life .
if this was any real company they would have had to change practices or been long bankrupted .
from u/ferigs on why are n't conservatives and republicans for the united states postal service ?
im not saying this to brag but to regain my pride .

just thought this could be a good place for people to chat and have a dialogue about the events as they unfold .
from what i 've heard so far there 's been a few buildings burned down and potentially a gunshot wound .
maybe my comment was short sighted but it was based on an actual discussion and debate with a friend who 's democratic .
i do have a real understanding of the democratic party and not all of them think this way just like not all trump supporters are white nationalists .
i just happened to be a conservative republican who does n't believe in our government calling all of the shot over certain things where we should have a choice .
i do not think all dems are simple minded as put so apologies .
from u/polythene\_pam73 on many americans voted for trump because he upheld their christian values. other than abortion what christian values do you believe trump embodies ?
when jesus saw money-changers and businessmen in the temple he not only destroyed thier stand but actually took out a whip and whipped them to drive them out .
while he was compassionate to sinners like tax collectors and prostitutes he also corrected them .
he never forcibly compelled somone to convert but he also did not for one second allow people to think thier conduct was permissible .
when somone was commiting an evil act he always conftonted them and usually very publicly .
jesus was not a person who said i would not do x but i have no place to tell others they ca n't '' and his followers should not be either .
from u/belisarius600 on for christian conservatives how do your beliefs determine your politics ?
to vote on the house floor right now means to be shoved into a room with a minimum of 434 other people .
the average age of people in congress is 60 so they 're risking their lives more than the average person if they were to do this .
trying to force people into such a situation seems incredibly irresponsible due to it increasing the likelihood of them catching covid exponentially .
from u/ny\_hour on why are republicans up in arms over proxy voting ?
first and foremost if i 'm in the usa which shipping do i choose to get it the fastest ?

i 've been streaming hbonow on my iphone through the app for years now .
i go to log in today and i 'm greeted with a message telling me that my app has been upgraded to hbomax !
oh wait ... after 20 minutes of fiddling around i now realize this is an underhanded move that actually removed a service i was paying for .
it 's not like i intentionally made sure i could stream on my phone when i subscribed to hbonow .
your hbonow subscription now does n't include a flagship service you 'll have to subscribe in some other way and pay more if you want access
you 're pissing on my leg and calling it rain .
you did n't upgrade my app you downgraded a service i was already paying for .
shame on you hbo now you 're just being greedy .
in too many of these games all the top players intentionally join one team so they can steamroll the other knowing that there are mostly amateur players there .
it can either be the actual level of the player or some kind of hidden elo system that takes into consideration your kda .
i consider myself to be straight but for a couple of years now i 've been having gay fantasies and watching gay porn .

my fiance and i started a patio garden at the start of shelter in place orders back in march .
we have 4 tomato plants 3 pepper plants carrots chives thyme rosemary and 5 planters with various flowers .
it 's become very comforting during this time to step away from work and on our small apartment patio and observe the daily changes .
we 're really looking forward to tomatoes and sauce and salsa .
we like our patio garden and want to keep it going .
problem we need to leave our apartment for 2 weeks .
how can we maintain our patio garden 's plant health ?
we do n't have a very big local network so asking someone to stop by would essentially be asking a stranger to do so and would likely cost a few bucks .
idea we could run an irrigation system on a timer from under the bathroom sink and through a bedroom window .
risk 1 vulnerability of breaking in through this window this bedroom window is on the second floor and already has an ac unit going through it so if someone wanted to break in it would have already happened in the last two years .
risk 2 leak with no one finding out for a long time and permanent damage caused .
we install an irrigation system from the bathroom sink via a hose through the bedroom window but a leak occurs .
we 're gone for two weeks and no one knows .
we cause permanent damage to our landlord 's property .
hi guys so i was playing for the better part of the year and i quit roughly 1-2 weeks before the greymoor patch now i decided to boot the game and i get around 500 ping at certain times mostly it 's fine however for some odd reason in some places my fps barely hits 10 but when i 'm in vivec city or alinor i got steady 60 fps is that something common ?
had couple of my toons parked in pretty abandoned dungeon and they too get around 5-10 fps feels like powerpoint simulator is that something on my end or has zos screwed something up ?

i believe the colors of the reeses puffs tee are off .
i pushed a player in the final circle who was prone shooting my teammates .
seeing him prone i open fire on his head the first two shots did n't register a hit marker so i went back to his torso those barely hit .
he noticed me then and retreated into one of those open storage rooms .
but when he began to move he stayed prone the whole time and moved at the same speed while prone that one can walk standing up .
i pushed him still spraying every part of his prone body but barely registered hits and he killed me winning the game .
in the kill cam he was never prone at all he was upright the whole time .
i have been writing algotrading strategies for more than 2 years now .
the lowest timeframe that has worked for me has been the 3h .
i assume there are algos using ml models such as the support vector machine or the reinforcement learning that work .
what i 'm wondering about is more about algos using pure ta indicators .
because i 'm close to give up on them for good .
what do you do when you feel unmotivated and unwilling to do something but just drag something on just for the sake of it but really do n't want to ?
i have a remote job as a fullstack developer but i do n't feel motivated to work as much when i 'm doing it as a job .
i learned to code purely out of curiosity and the passion for building things and i still love it .
but i do n't seem to be able to put in the same passion into the job .
office issues aside logically this does not make any sense to me as to why i 'm putting the bare minimum effort into this .
i have always gone above and beyond what 's expected of me in the past .
i 'm not able to figure out what 's holding me back .

after getting very drunk in a club we make our way back to the room and see where the night takes us .
mum and dad have gone out for the night so we decide to have a couple of friends around have a few drink and as the night progresses someone suggests an innocent game of truth and dare .
as the drinks get more frequent the dares get more explicit .
i 've turned up to a house party with a few friends as the beer starts flowing who do i run into but my sister .
my only limits are scat gore and toilet play .
hit me up on dm or chat if you 're interested .
i replaced one of our hard drives yesterday and it went in the wrong volume it 's the drive 2 .
can i deactivate it and put it in the volume 2 to increase the size of the volume 2 ?
it 's almost full i do n't need this additional drive on the storage pool 1 or what is the process ?

but i shouldnt have to go out of my way to download and use a new os just to get some more fps in a game with these graphics that is suppose '' to be a greatly optimized game .
games like valorant and csgo thrive on cpu and anyone with a i7 from the last 2 years should be able to run the game on extremely high fps .
ambulance is spelled backwards on them so you can read the words in your mirror .
i wonder how it fares once a hurricane or 2 rolls thru .
your strategy works even if it does not fit my style at all .
the only thing i can add to the newcomers is to forget everything they have been used to the last 15 years and it is okay to retreat from some missions .
i had a couple of drops that had the same enchantment on two different slots and i was n't sure if it would work or not .

they cut out 7 lymph nodes for me from the area right around the thyroid and 6/7 were malignant .
they 'll often do this if they think there might be lymph node involvement .
sometimes they do this as a precaution if they 're worried about microscopic spread and sometimes they can tell just from looking at a lymph node that it 's got cancer .
if this is what they do for your wife then our experiences might be similar .
i found that i needed to put a hand on the back of my head to lift myself up whenever i needed to get up to compensate for the neck muscles that had been cut .
i am now 2.5 week post op and i got out of bed without doing this for the first time yesterday .
for me coughing talking and swallowing felt really weird and sometimes painful the first week after the surgery .
but things will get back to normal and improve a bit day by day .
i actually took a video of myself talking after the first day so i could watch it a few days later and say hey i still sound like an 80 year old smoker but i 'm better than three days ago when i sounded like a 90 year old smoker ! it was a great way to encourage myself because the healing builds up over time and it 's sometimes hard to see day by day .
of course some of that was because my voice had been impacted by the surgery .
the tumor was unencapsulated and pressed right up against my trachea and laryngal nerve .
they had to peel if off the nerve and my voice is still recovering .
but it 's getting better every day and i have the videos to prove it !
her throat may hurt from the intubation and swallowing may be a problem from swelling or weakness around the incision .
i also chewed on ice a lot during the first three days .
oh for sure you 're totally right like it does n't take a lot to be polite .
but also natural lulls happen or people do n't vibe enough to message back and i feel like everyone needs to just chill .
it 's just matter of time before another outbreak begins inside a ship unless strict measures are enforced .
television is a medium because anything well done is rare .
just as an outside observer a whole lot of your examples intended to show that emojis make things clearer actually cause the meaning of the sentence to become less clear .
however i do think the winky face was among the clearer ones .
even though i personally hate emojis for purely illogical reasons .

gaga especially has been very supportive of both kpop and jpop before it was the thing to do .
she had both crayon pop and miku hatsune jpop vocaloid open for dates on her tour in 2014 .
that was pretty huge at the time since there were n't really any western artists acknowledging it the only other one i can think of from back then is snoop dogg since he featured on a snsd remix in 2011/2012 and also released hangover with psy in 2014 .
edit some more good additions to this list are in the comments below !
yeah usually you have to save from within the game

that might be her intention indeed but imho she 's severely overcompensating if that 's the case .
player salaries have gone up with newer tv deals and national deals .

it 's not for everyone ... but calling the story of pathologic basic '' is objectively wrong tbh .

which of santa 's reindeers needs to mind his manners the most ?
my favourite is either deception or armageddon mk9 is close though .
deception had the best atmosphere modes and one of the best soundtracks .
it 's roster was also really good and unique introducing some of my favourite characters havik and hotaru .
armageddon also had great atmosphere great modes and one of the best soundtracks .
it also had the best roster in the series which will never be topped including every character up until that point .
when it comes to least favourite not worst because they 're all good i would probably say deadly alliance or mk2 .
both of these games have a lot of positives including great soundtracks and good rosters mk2 's introduced some of the most iconic characters and da introduced some of my favourites and was unique but they have some stuff holding them back .
for mkda it 's just that i 'd rather play mkd or mka instead of it if i feel like playing a 3d era game as they have more content and i prefer the gameplay in them .
for mk2 i think that the ai massively holds it back and just makes the game unfun to play which is a shame because it 's otherwise well made i never feel like playing the game because i just think of the ai it 's fun against real players though .
i was tempted to put mk1 as least favourite but i judged it less harshly because it 's the first game and let it off with some of it 's flaws .
i 'm also a fan of mkvsdc so i would not have included that anyway even if it was allowed in this thread .
i 'm using controller and when i go to type on screen keyboard pops up and does n't go away .

the main benefit for b550 is native support for zen 3 and pcie4 .
since zen 3 will be available on most b450 boards you would be fine going that route if you do n't think pcie4 is that big of a deal .
it 's true that zen 3 will be the end of the am4 socket though you 'll still have that upgrade option from zen 2 plus it 's always possible amd releases a zen 3 refresh like the xt zen 2 chips now .
you 'll probably want to wait a year or two after am5 releases anyways because first gen chips are often wonky .

it 's much better to have a huge amount of knowledge some of which is n't true than to know virtually nothing but everything you know is true .

as a parent of a child who is high needs and is coded x4 i find this conversation fascinating .
i understand the frustration on both sides but i 100 agree with you about misplaced blame .
but my kid is doing very very well through all of this and i can only attribute that to the teachers who are doing an amazing job at keeping my kid s engaged focused and educated .
if some teachers can do very very well with that and others ca n't i can kind of understand wanting to blame the teachers .

i 'm going under the assumption that i enjoy at least 2 other players and am warmly neutral to the rest with just the dm sticking out .
though you are correct those issues are typically prevalent amongst more than one person and if the other players displayed the issues i would similarly walk away .
also i 'm not forcing the dm to do my bidding but rather i am forcing him to respect his boundaries as dm and to keep his personal biases out of my character .
i am blunt almost to the point of being an asshole but i keep that jn check by ensuring the bluntness only comes out when there is a nonsensical decision being made that directly affects me .

usually that means pick a suitable language maybe come up with some prefixes and suffixes find a word and then corrupt the result .

similarly the elven homeland sendaris is shend destroy ris to mean destroyed/lost land ''

oh i 'm 6'1 i tower over women and i 'd be just drowning in their pussy juices if i was n't so fucking tall .
this is what i was referring to by narcissism .
you are obsessed with the physical features of yourself and others .
they worry about weak wrists and the tilt of the eyes and every permutation of jawline .
it 's all an excuse for one of two things maybe more i 'm not an incel either you are mad at the world because you expect perfect 10 's to lay down at your feet or because you need someone to blame for your lack of courage to walk up to a woman and talk to her .
i genuinely genuinely hope you are proven wrong someday .
i hope you get past this idiot phase you are in find someone that loves you and move on with your life .
in the meantime i 'm going to make fun of incels and you with them .
that 's true but your comment made it sound like aang kept the map just because he was n't the center of attention not because he was n't the center of attention and also because he thought he was going to be abandoned .
aang is only 12 years old so he is pretty much a baby .
got ta take the first one and honestly beardo is great .

well intel just dropped the 10xxx chips so there 's that and there are some roomers of ryzen 3xxx xt coming soon next month ?
with the 3600xt looking like a really great overall cpu for games as well .
also i 've noticed the higher end gpu prices falling like crazy 2070-2080 with possible new gpus in september .
if all you do is gaming and nothing crazy i would look at the amd 3300x for cpu and whatever you can afford in the gpu side .
it was n't until i was almost dying that my appendicitis hurt like a mofo anywhere near my cramps
though also having adhd there is no such thing as take it slow '' lawl it 's always been more case of once i 'm on the bike i want to go as fast as i can go and the only things that slow me down is stamina headwinds and hills .
irrespective of how well or fit i am though bit better on the well '' part after a hell-trip tramping post-flu hence the shorter route to start off .
pretty much fine today now though but last night 's insomnia mean 's today 's a bust anyhow .
food wise no chance depression and sleep fun makes it a pain to cook most weeks so i ca n't really diet in so much as avoid buying icecream etc and just exercise more .
and if i do n't eat enough i end up either getting insomnia wtf oh brain of mine or blood pressure fun .
hopefully getting back to biking daily and eventually hitting the gym later on will help .
but at this point i 'm waiting more to see if ketamine pills will finally break this bloody 5 year long depressive episode and give me back my ability to build up stamina .

i thought i had seen hov painted on the road towards uptown around cloverdale ?
i know there are painted markings on the road so i might be confusing bus for hov .
you do n't seem responsible or mature now so i highly doubt this is true .
i mean you can do all that if you have time after your 9-5 job and doing class work .
so maybe it is more similar than you think .
the current tlx is a compact not quite a midsize .
the back is a bit cramped for a typical family sedan especially compared to the current camry and accord .
this is as far from the truth as it literally can possibly be .
i know how hard it is to become sober from an unhealthy thing in my life .
good on you for being a dick as well .
i 'll do the combat game and the diner counter for the headpiece and the bed !
there 's quite a few good videos out there .
i ca n't get them right now but once you learn it the first time it 's super simple after .
also join the vrchat discord they 're super useful .
both great shows though initial d quality falls off on fifth stage imo .
i cant say i 'm out of the woods yet but i 'm hopeful .
all the logic all the thinking all the resistance and i just could n't do it anymore .
i grabbed all the meds in the house and locked myself in my room for hours .
i waited to see what was going to win me or my depression .
i stalled as best i could for as long as possible until i broke free .
i 've done it before with the same knowledge that u may not make it the next time i loose myself .
i dream that i grow big and strong and brave and can keep the people i love safe .
i dream of beating down this suffocating agony that no one else can see and getting my life back .
i dream of finding the right prescription medication with my psychiatrist so that i can take back control of my will to live .
i want to be free and i 'm trying to get that freedom on my terms not by trying to kill myself again and finally following through .
but sometimes it 's like im drowning and i cant get back up for air .
what are the differences between phone guy and phone dude

i have had these wrinkles i guess you could call them on my lower outer gums for a long time like 3 years and both the dentist and periodontist agreed it was benign and probably caused by uncontrolled gerd .
this past week i had a crown come loose and while i 'm waiting to see the dentist i 've been rinsing my mouth about 4 times a day with peroxyl mouthwash to keep the loose crown clean until it can be reglued .
the past few days i 've noticed the wrinkles in my gums have become sore and inflamed looking .
is this due to the peroxide washes something else ?
obviously my worry is oral cancer of some sort .
some of us today were talking about this stock one of which i have had my eyes on for 3 months now and was very excited to see the volume it gained today .
i will share with all of you the reasons why i am so bullish for electra meccanica .
they are a canadian manufacturer of fully electric vehicles that was established in 2015 .
they have always been a pre production company that is until later this year .
they are expected to release their first vehicle the solo .
the solo is a single person three-wheeled fully electric vehicle that you can reserve for purchase online now .
perfect for daily commuters that do n't have a long drive and for those that want a cheaper than average electric vehicle .
i personally believe that it will go beyond appealing to regular consumers it is perfect for businesses/warehouses that already use vehicles to get around .
it would also be great for 3rd party food delivery service drivers if there are enough chargers around .
made continued progress toward production launch of the company 's flagship solo ev with a planned strategic debut in the los angeles market in the coming months followed by rollouts in other west coast cities later in 2020 .
after engaging bdo usa 's site selection business incentives practice to lead a search for an assembly facility and engineering technical center in the u.s. the company identified seven states as finalists and has sent initial requests for proposals to the chief economic development entities in each of arizona colorado florida north carolina south carolina tennessee and texas .
the leading location and backup sites are expected to be announced in the fourth quarter of 2020 .
began development of new solo mobile app available for both ios and android which will provide owners with a connected vehicle experience including various remote vehicle monitoring capabilities .
opened first retail kiosk at the westfield century city shopping mall in los angeles providing customers with the opportunity to view test drive and place pre-orders in a modern sleek storefront .
electrameccanica will open additional kiosks throughout 2020 in southern california locations as well as in the san francisco area washington and oregon .
entered into an agreement with freedomroad financial a national lending institution providing retail vehicle loans to the nation 's leading vehicle manufacturers to provide consumers with turnkey vehicle financing solutions for the company 's flagship solo ev .
appointed accomplished financial executive and electrameccanica chief financial officer ms. bal bhullar to the board of directors effective december 6 2019 .
appointed peter savagian as an independent director a pioneer in automotive electrification with a broad spectrum of expertise in the technology development launch and production of electric vehicles including the first modern electric vehicle the gm ev1 the first plug-in hybrid the chevy volt and the industry 's first long-range value ev the chevy bolt .
interview with cfo https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wknfy0saoyk https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=wknfy0saoyk
i have no idea how i found this or if this is even the original creator of the video .
all i know is it provides good information even if it is a small youtube channel .
even if this car is not something you would drive i am confident there is a lot of people who would .
it is too appealing for a number of reasons .
also keep in mind this is not the only vehicle they are designing the solo is just the first launch .
they are also working on a sports class electric vehicle called tofino and an oldies luxury one as well called eroadster .
if anyone has additional info i 'd be happy to add it .
i made a shorter version of my issue because i realize i basically wrote a novel when i did n't need to lol but i 'm a server at a restaurant in texas and my work is denying my unemployment claim even though they have n't scheduled me in over a month .
they 're saying i denied hours when that is n't true .
i have texts i sent to my manager asking for shifts as proof .
i was told i was a great worker and was told i still had my job after all the covid stuff was done .
i already filed an appeal my boss is asking to see me for a meeting on saturday and wo n't tell me what it 's about .
i hate what they 're doing to me and it 's causing me a lot of stress .
after doing some reading it seems like maybe they 're just trying to get me to quit which i do n't believe is legal .
i do n't even want to work for them anymore after all of this anyway .
what rights do i have in this situation and is there a way i can still get my unemployment owed and no longer work for this place ?
i thought everyone had gone back to normal school at this point .
i recently saw a post asking about red rashes on their legs and if others get something similar .
i do and this got me to thinking about my legs lupus and shaving .
my skin has always been very sensitive mainly due to eczema and allergies .
when i was diagnosed in 2018 i joined a few communities to learn more and noticed that others have had similar rashes and such that i assumed were just always a part of me .
so i 'm curious if this issue i 've had for a long time is something possibly tied to lupus or if it 's just me .
no matter what i seem to do my legs always break out in red rashes and hives after shaving .
for the next two days my legs are so unbearably itchy and break out in small bumps almost like acne which scab over .
the spots take forever to heal weeks sometimes months .
now this is something i 've dealt with for a long time and have just accepted it to be part of my life but again i 'm very curious if there 's anyone else in the community that has a similar issue and if not maybe some good advice ?
i tried switching to an electric shaver for a while and it helped with the rash/hives in the beginning but i still broke out with itchy bumps once the hair started growing back again with spots/scabs that lasted forever .
i 'm allergic to nair and most of the shaving creams i have tried .
i have tried various body washes lotions and even conditioners to use while shaving and my hives reaction is not as severe but ending result is same .
for after shaving many creams and lotions irritate my eczema or cause a reaction so i only have a couple i can actually use .
however i 've tried a lot of top creams and lotions nivea eucerin aveeno etc .
vitamin e oil body butters coconut oil vaseline cocoa butter ointments anything with the word eczema in it etc. etc. you get the point .
but no combination has ever resulted in silky smooth legs .
it 's embarrassing so i do n't wear shorts or anything that shows my legs .
it 's a miserable cycle of wanting to shave my legs because i hate having leg hair but also not wanting to go through the 2-3 days of itchy hell and rash only to have to shave again .
but i 've tried soooooo many combinations and even things like
to the point i 've ruined clothes by staining them .
really stinks and i almost do n't want to post this but i 'm curious if anyone else in the community or out is dealing with something similar .
is that if i go to get on and realize my headphones are dead i can get them to full battery before i can load into a game

hi all i recently purchased a sword from kult of athena it 's a dark age viking sword .
it looks very nice and seems to be nice quality but i do have one issue .
it 's has a brazil nut pommel which looks really really nice .
it 's actually one of the main reasons i bought the sword in the first place however i find it extremely uncomfortable .
getting a full swing is almost impossible due to the pommel cutting into my wrist .
of course i 'm not a sword master or anything so if anyone has any tips for how to properly hold or swing it that would be awesome .
it 's a great looking sword and i 'd hate to return it but it does n't seem like something i would be able to use practically .

i was wondering if i could pick some brains in this community ?
i have self-coded my tech blog in .net core 3 and am looking to improve the way i display code snippets in my articles .
i 've got a number of ideas and envision these snippets as being dynamic with tabs annotations and whatnot !
i want to self-host these snippets stored in a local db .
now my blog 's editor uses a markdown framework specifically simplemde https github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor .
in this framework your content is converted into markdown stored somewhere and later rendered to html by the controller and passed to the view .
consequently adding additional content such as external components that ca n't be parsed from markdown to html is tricky .
firstly the structure of the snippet is stored in a partial view .
when writing my content i will code the functionality to create a snippet and save to the db the editor will then place a textual identifier in the markdown example codesnippet id .
when viewing an article the controller will convert the markdown to html code ready to return it the view as it normally does .
however before it does return i will retrieve the list of identifiers from html .
a list of snippet partial views are populated with the content associated with each identifier and then rendered to html .
the identifiers in the main html are then replaced with the associated snippet partial html .
this approach seems a bit heavy and i wondered if you have any suggestions to improve this process ?
i have the relevant to and from whitelisted yet a regular email thread keeps getting marked as phishing .
i started in july 2019 with 59k in debt and currently have 41.8k left .
all my credit cards and my personal loan are paid off whoo and i am now working on my car with 8.8k to go .
my goal is to pay this off by my birthday later this year and i am on track to meet that goal early .
i have a job that 's secure but i am starting to get the feeling that i wo n't be at this particular job at the end of 2021 unless things improve .
i do n't feel the need to leave right now but i can see myself wanting something new by this time next year .
if you were me would you stay the course with bs2 and pay off the car or would you enter storm mode pile up money and see how things pan out with the job ?
i will eat the interest in the interim but i can also just throw it all on the car if the clouds stop looming .
how do we feel about pre-hartnell doctors visiting skaro ?

i do n't want to live with depression but i do n't find myself wanting to get better .
it feels like my mental health is a genuine part of me now and i feel like i ca n't just abandon that part in favor of actually being okay with who i am .
physical self-harm and suicidal tendencies have n't been problems for me as of yet but i keep pushing myself into things that i know are unhealthy .
like not eating because i thought i 'd be happier if i was conventionally attractive not letting myself sleep because it 's just who i am forcing myself to keep up my grades even though i could n't care less about school .
telling myself that i 'm a weak person if i even dare to reach out to anyone and talk about what 's going on with me .
i do want to have a good night 's rest .
i want to tell myself that it 's okay to not be the best at everything i try .
honestly i want to be comfortable with who i am so bad .
because those things just do n't feel like me and i ca n't just throw myself away .
as cliché as it sounds i 'm so used to having walls up that i do n't know what i 'd do if they came down .
i ca n't even imagine life without mental illness .

is n't it strange to think that silent hill to the player is a hellish landscape where only suffering exists but to everyone else it 's a completely normal town where life is normal and people carry out their day to day lives unmolested by whatever psychological torment the protagonist has unknowningly brought upon themselves for example what james sunderland silent hill 2 had done in his past and the guilt that consumed him drew him into the pocket dimension in which he is punished .

a lot of schools including mine mandate their students to use proprietary software that is a direct threat to their privacy and freedom including microsoft windows microsoft teams and proprietary web applications like google classroom or google documents .
the students are required to register on these sites/services and provide some of the biggest advertising companies with their data .
no i do n't care if you did n't find anything even close that 's opensource .
that 's no reason to force students to give up their privacy and freedom .
for example we will have typewriting classes next year .
we will have to install windows on our own computers because the typewriting-practice software only runs on it .
we also have to use windows because ms office and ms onenote not part of office afaik is required although i survived one full year on ubuntu with their online version and taking notes in vi still it was inconvenient .

hurting others habitually and repeatedly is not a normal thing for humans to do although i know that sadly it does happen a lot .
in short it was not your fault that you were abused/bullied and good for you to be working on healing your self-loathing because those negative thoughts came about in the first place due to boatloads of lies .
you may and must be on your own side and treat yourself as a good friend .
it 'll throw up warnings if it gets dangerously hot .
high temps like that will definitely accelerate wear and tear on your battery and will shorten its lifespan though .

you 'll give republicans an idea on who to back next for president .
amazing how easy it is to recognize someone based on their habits even when they 're trying to be anonymous .
some of my job involves a fair deal of fraud detection and the tells can be pretty silly sometimes .
and i guess that ideas about saving the world is a socialist thing .
he 's a spicy one and i recognize the girls last tour symbol anywhere .

not impressed with the look of this set ... .. unfortunately i will still buy it 😕
if someone invites me on a date i expect them to pay .
specifically if it 's without a doubt a date .
if i invite them on a date i pay .
if i was invited on a date by someone and they did n't pay it would be a red flag to me .
i would think they had no social skills/did n't respect me .
this only applies if it 's definitely a date .
people seem to be super angry that guys typically ask for the first date and pay most of the time .
i probably would recommend that you get to know someone as a friend before going on a date .
that way you are n't paying for a whole bunch of first dates .
it 's equally impressive that you guys are getting a bunch of dates while also not making it past the first one .
i will definitely have to look into a keto monte cristo .
i used to love ours when i worked at a french bakery .
i 've been wanting to make that as well as our mornay sauce we used to put on the crepes there .
for sure going to have to do some experimenting but you 'll see it here first if i come up with anything haha .

look man as long as the politicians or more accurately their advisors and the experts they consult from time to time know what they 're doing and what 's where then it 's all good .
daily life is complicated enough already to demand everyone to know every little trivia all the time .
we have google and public libraries for that kind of thing .
risk of rain 2 and hollow knight are both great and cheap .
edit did n't read the whole post you can ignore that hollow knight thing .
play enter the gungeon instead or into the breach is really good as well .
do you know what a low mortality rate means ?
tap into some sex and body positive artists and voices .
listen to your partners expressions of love and admiration of your physical body .
find ways to love and appreciate your body which does so much for you .
and yes all bodies can be sexy are sexy are sexual are worthy of pleasure and to be found beautiful and enticing .
let yourself be gassed up by compliments from your partner about what they like appreciate and find sexy about your body you deserve to feel good .
the smaller parties are generally unelectable because of reasons unrelated to this .
almost implies some insane motivation because pure stupidity and incompetence is less plausible for this heinous murder .

all the other posts are saying i do n't like guns and people do n't need them and my neighbour says the same thing so trudeau should arbitrarily start seizing random styles of guns .

do you have any sympathy for the rioters and looters who use the protests as an excuse to misbehave ?
my anecdote can be dismissed as fiction because some humans lie so much they ca n't believe anyone else would tell the truth it 's just not profitable !
but when i was with the crowd being detained there was a line of riot cops .
an old man he looked frail to me an old hippie that had given up the tie dye reached toward the cop in front of him and mouthed a plea for something and the cop elbowed him in the face and said get off my stick '' .
it was n't an imgur link that i posted it was something i grabbed off google .
it was really bad so i changed the link to one someone else provided .
all of my edits are now confusing but i 'm not gon na edit it more because i 'd probably just make it even more confusing .
i 'm so upset that my dad died i 'm going to punch a puppy ! ! ! ! ''

is more saying that there are certain things that predators will look for to make it easier for them .
things like dark alleyways away from more public thoroughfares are going to make it easy for crimes of any sort to be committed .
and short skirts are going to make it easier to rape a woman .
it 's not blaming the person wearing the skirt what they wear should n't matter and the guy says he does n't like that it does as they should be safe no matter what they wear .
but he 's not talking about the sane reaction to a skirt here and very much does n't seem to be victim-blaming .
he 's talking about the fact that there are some sick fucking pieces of shit who are going to rape someone anyway because their whims are more important to them than anything like the wellbeing of others or basic fucking morality .
to those people it 's not that the skirt will suddenly make them incapable of holding themselves back .
to them they just see an easier time getting what they want from this person than the one wearing trousers and so it influences their specific choice of victim .
if everyone wore trousers these people would still be raping .
they 'd just have some other criteria for what makes it easiest for them .
if i had to choose one i would choose chili 's
it is definitely a robin i have more pictures of the robin on the line after .
i 'll have to look for the avery and ommegang they are distributed here .
there are several different ways to run leds and one of them is a buck converter https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buck_converter configured to pass a stable current through the leds .
the advantages of this method are that it does not waste any power in resistors and minimizes flicker in the light output .
the nature of these converters is that — without even being specifically designed to — they will adjust for changes in the input voltage drawing more current as the voltage drops .
thus they can work over a wide range of input voltages .
this is how almost any power adapter that says it works on either 120 or 240 volts does that .
however a buck converter ca n't produce a higher voltage other types of converters can but they are more complex so the minimum voltage such a led driver will work at is the forward voltage of the actual led string .

maggie the actress who plays maca signed a contract for another series cable girls .
about a year later fox bought the rights to the show and produced seasons 3 and 4 and maggie could n't be in it due to her busy schedule .
they also asked for the episodes and seasons to be shorter and for there to be less nude scenes .
later they killed maggie 's character in cable girls so she could reprise her role as macarena at the end of season 4 and in the spin off that came out this year vis a vis el oasis .
long story short it was a series of unfortunate events 😂😂
they should make a teen comedy movie where a awkward teenager fucks a pie .

in 2006 chauvin was one of six officers from the third precinct who responded to a stabbing at a minneapolis home .
police said wayne reyes stabbed his friend and his girlfriend and then threatened to kill all of them with a shotgun .
he got out of the vehicle with a shotgun and several officers fired multiple shots '' killing reyes police said in a report .
police said that leroy martinez 23 drew his gun near a playground at the little earth of united tribes public housing complex and that an officer shot him after he refused to drop the gun and listen to commands .
chauvin and other officers arrived at the scene and while none of them fired their weapons they were all placed on a standard three-day administrative leave as part of the investigation .
in 2008 chauvin and a second officer were called to a residence for a domestic disturbance .
according to police ira latrell toles 21 was holed up in a bathroom and tried to escape when chauvin got inside .
when toles refused to obey chauvin 's order to get down police said a struggle began and toles grabbed for chauvin 's weapon .
chauvin fired twice hitting toles in the abdomen the pioneer press newspaper of st. paul reported .

the duscur rebellion dedue 's paralogue was in no way whatsoever connected to twsitd .
they 're only in that situation because of the slithers orchestrating them getting blamed for regicide .
the following genocide of duscur an act separate from the tragedy of duscur was entirely 100 caused by faerghus without any outside manipulation whatsoeve
it was literally a falseflag operation by the slithers .
the kingdom fell for it and fucked duscur up but it was caused by the slithers .
like you literally said the tragedy of duscur was caused by twsitd '' which is why faerghus attacks duscur

i 'd argue that a manager with the attitude of as long as your job is done well and on time i do n't care if you have free time '' is by default a good manager .

if you want to turn 500 into thousands fast you 're going to need to be fantastic at high risk options trading likely with leverage and unless you really know what you 're doing you are most likely going to lose that 500 .
if you want to grow it then buying into a diverse set of etf 's an index fund or mutual fund would be the best bet .
during that time learn more about investing before you do much more than that and leave those high risk strategies for the future or that 500 will be gone .
best bet spy dia or qqq etf or maybe a mix of them let it grow for some time and learn all you can .
the fact that you 're investing at this point is absolutely incredible in and of itself .
all unions should stop existing since no one is forcing you to be '' at a crap of a place right ?
the idea of unionization is due to the fact that the greedy man will pee on you .

thats a lame ass way to look at employment .

could it be that man has become more 'comfortable ' thinking himself more in control of his own destiny when placing his stake for the reason of his existence in the realm of the observable ?
the believe that man is made in the image of their creator god !
you can see what is at stake man 's spiritual identity .
evolutionists can see/observe their bodies but they can not 'see ' god 's spirit residing in their bodies unless they develop a relationship with their creator god .
therefor spirit not being 'observable ' man tries its best to either ignore his spiritual essence or outright deny it if solely led by scientific argument .
2. who who 's authority established that the concept of evolution is superior or the only valid premise when explaining the visible world ?
it appears that the other side because of having the 'weaker ' arguments needed to stack the odds in their favor by authoritatively dismissing/excluding the supernatural from the debate and with that prevent an honest and fair dialogue over equally faith based world views .
it is well established that the knowledge of the creator god is being undermined or even eliminated on all levels of societal dialogue .
why do we allow the evolutionary/science based world view to set/establish the rules for a dialogue ?
under their premise of 'superiority of science ' we will never be considered an equal partner or can we have a fair dialogue .
if we were allowed as an equal this would imply/establish that we the 'other side ' has 'valid ' arguments .
this can not be allowed to be established since this would threaten the core position of their believe an existence without a god .
it can really be only one position to the exclusion of the other at least what concerns the creation of this earth and its mankind .
this is the battle over the primal spiritual source of mankind .
and that is the 'crux of the matter ' .
why are we finding ourselves always in the 'defense ' position ?
we recognize/identify the forces that have stacked the deck to favor the other side by their goal !
we can unashamedly unabashedly declare the truth about god to the world !
no need to debate no need to submit/accept to the false source just let the truth be told !

i mean grinding is the same in both so its up to you ?
i think if you already have a class that can grind and you have full tet boss armor/weapons tri golden accessories on it or more then you 're better off grinding on regular servers with that toon to be honest .
if you want to level any other extra class then its solid choice to use seasonal character .

police are judged on the action they chose instead of the actions they could have chosen .
this is abused by cops at their own discretion and it is clearer when a cop kills someone and a different cop chooses not to kill someone for even more life threatening actions .

again pitched against each other for infinite times have a similar body of work too .
both were equally popular with yash raj dharma and khans .
kajol has definitely seen bigger blockbusters but she was often deemed too safe and comfortable to take on challenges .
rani on the other hand also had huge successes but her performances brought her more acclaim than anything else .
both are cousins but never really close to each other at all .
kajol has all her biggest successes opposite srk her couple with srk is definitely the most loved her roles have a really fond nostalgia fond loveable memories attached to them .
ddlj kkhh k3g fanaa gupt ishq my name is khan she has lived all those roles and she brought something very unique very endearing to the screens .
she had won immense critical acclaim and commercial successes as well .
she never actually utilised her full potential she was at the top of her game with 4 big successes that she decided to get married at 24 .
she then shocked everyone with fanaa which was easily the most successful comeback for any mainstream actress .
she is still the most pleasing actor to spot in a tanhaji though very comfortable in her body of work .
she never had a pressing ambition to rise to the top she just came in bursts did her magic and went back .
rani on the other hand had a very shaky career a b grade debut big break with kkhh career hitting to an all time low and then rising to the top around 2005 when she was even more ubiquitous than alia .
black veer zaara hum tum bunty aur babli mangal panday kank chalte chalte she was in every popular and successful movie .
what cemented her position further was her amazing impeccable acting her monopoly at every award for those 2-3 year period .
she then disappeared soon had quite failing comebacks but mardaani franchise and hichki did the magic for her and did absolute justice to a talent like her .
she had a certain charm she was the last of the generation of actresses that were graceful and unique probably never felt extra .
personally i like her movies with saif a lot hum tum ta ra rum pum and even tptm all have aged so well and a regular favourite with my family .
personal lives wise kajol is a lot more respected reserved but goofy and funny and does n't take herself too seriously though she is often termed somewhat spineless too .
she is a treat to watch in interviews now .
rani on the other hand is not too much for breaking a marriage affairs with govinda catty vibes with many co actors etc etc .
but her image has got much better now thanks to her strong bold women centric roles .

we are doing great in australia when it comes to covid .
people on his sub are still wanting/hoping for a vaccine to covid before opening up fully .
so my question is how long are people willing to wait before opening up fully and to the rest of the world ?
that is a long time in anyone 's life .
i certainly do n't want to wait a year or two before international travel comes back .
the most i will be willing to give is till the end of the year .
there is also no way that to come back to australia from overseas travel that you have to spend 14 days in isolation that defeats the purpose of going on a holiday .

i am an aspiring streamer on twitch and i have a plan to play records to my viewers in real-time and discuss music-related topics with the chat as records play .
i am wondering how this would be possible with an at-lp120 .
i do not want to record anything no audacity/recording software but simply playback what spinning on my turntable live to my stream on twitch .
is there a recommended software that 'll allow this to happen the smoothest/easiest ?
i do n't exactly want to invest in a dj software as i do n't personally have plans to dj necessarily .
again simply play records to my pc to my desktop audio so my twitch stream can enjoy as well .

so i have done mushrooms with the same friend two times now within the span of 3 ish months .
the first time we did it we each took 1/8th and it was mostly amazing .
we went on a long walk to the beach were in awe of the beauty of the world felt like we shared the same brain/trip the entire time and felt mostly euphoric the entire time .
toward the end i started to have a bad trip ? .
i over heard some guys talking about me tripping balls at the beach still not sure if that was real or not and it got me stuck in a paranoid loop for an hour or so and kept thinking that i need to get out of here i 'm going to wake up in the hospital i 'm going to be stuck like this forever yada yada .
once we got back to our house i was able to ground myself and it was okay again .
flash forward to the second time we did them .
i was already kind of nervous about doing it again based off the very short bad experience i had the last time but i did it anyways .
i took less 2.7g ish and this time it was way worse .
the entire come up i was super anxious nauseous kept worrying i would have a bad trip and it basically left me laying in bed alone freaking tf out .
so i have read that taking smaller doses can sometimes lead to more anxious trips but i 'm also worried that my mindset is off too .
but i also ca n't help my mindset because it 's my brain and i do n't know how to just forget about my negative thoughts .
i really want to do mushrooms again because the majority of my first time was amazing and i want to feel that again but i 'm worried i 'm going to continue to have bad trips .
i just set up my trezor wallet and wanted to transfer some small amounts to practice before putting it all on there .

i 'm just wondering if this is an acceptable range for a cat ?
body weight healthy range when weighed at the vets .
past issues one incident of diarrhoea and vomiting in december .
had a blood test which came back normal no issues with this since .
just a bit of a sensitive tummy the vet thinks .
current issue i 've noticed my cats breaths per minute whilst resting are about 40 breaths per minute .
when she 's sleeping her stomach moves in and out noticeably but it does n't seem laboured .
still playful and but will often get over excited .
i was just wondering if this is something to be concerned about .
basically the .ain character of an episode is being selfish '' or devious or the particular main character is doing what they want whether it be harmless or harmful .
then another character comes in and thinks that they should stop or do something else .
the main character ignores til near the end of the episode where they start feeling remorse guilty or second guesses themselves thanks to the secondary character that swayed them in attempt to teach the audience morals like huh maybe i should n't neglect my family to participate in this event i love but ca n't go to due to it conflicting with something my family wanted to do '' or you 're right i should n't have done that bad thing what was i thinking i 'm an idiot and i should 've listened to you '' they often demonize something that 's really good for a character and make it harmful to them because of the plot.like a character becoming super popular the .
becoming a dick then realizing that they 've become a dick and are remorseful .
as apposed to becoming popular or famous and remaining the way they were or becoming a better person .
or maybe becoming a bad person and going through with whatever they plan to do .
basically any animated sitcom ... like yeah i get it .
but why does every theme have to be the same character has crazy idea plan or action other character disagrees or does n't like the idea or actions main character disregards continues main character pussies out half way is remorseful and suck up to other character formula ?
sometimes i just wan na see a character not be sorry for wanting to enjoy something or a character doing some wild shit and actually going through with it with being like oh no .. janet you were right idk what i was thinkin '
people do shit people can be selfish '' we do n't need to have a moral shoved down our throats with every episode especially if the characters are already inherently bad like peter griffen or stan smith .
i 'm not saying make them asshats all the time .
let them learn lessons but at the same time let them enjoy themselves or learn their own lessons .
i think this is why i like rock and morty so much because there 's a mix of both .
sometimes the characters will be assholes but then they realize they might have been too mean and feel remorse .
other times the othercharacters attempt to try and teach the main character a lesson but the main character will probably pretend to care but goes right back to it .
like in s1e1 when beth and jerry try to put rick in a retirement home for jeopardizing mortys grades and being a general dick .
but rick pretends he 's doing good and respects jerry more and tricks them into thinking morty is smart .
only to turn around and lie to morty incapacitated on the floor and say that he 's still gon na take him out of school and on adventures no matter what his parents say .
i understand why they do n't want to do it because it has the potential to create a continuity that they do n't want to keep track of so they want to keep their characters neutral at the end of the episode so the next one still makes sense but they do n't have to make something so grand that would have to be continued .
let 's say this ... chris from family guy becomes popular and does a bunch of crazy shit .
next episode they maybe ask were n't you popular before ? ''
chris says something like yeah until they caught me doing some stupid shit idk '' case closed .
most of these shows do n't even care about what happened last episode despite recalling past events .
i just want to watch an adult animated show that is n't trying to teach me obvious lessons or things i have learned as a child .
i wish 2k added a system where we could choice the dunks we wanted to do i 'm so sick of the stupid dunk animation where you get blocked cause your guy decided to do the dumbest dunk ever in traffic i think it would be insane if we could control dunk animations with the right and left triggers and analog sticks you could also do it for layups so you have to do the right dunk/layup in the right situation it would be awesome online cause it would make it more skill based

hi i am trying to enable cheat codes on super mario brothers 2 ...
but when i try to enable cheats it does n't work .
i bought the razer basilisk x hyperspeed because it was cheaper and better specced .
i found out that i hardly need anything close to 16000 dpi and 3600\~4000 dpi is good enough .
one thing i 'll note is that it definitely needs to be bluetooth .
i 'm using it for my laptop not usually gaming and plugging in and out of the usb-a port is something i do n't want to do .
pros cheaper price longer warranty subjectively better specs only a few months old more up to date specs lighter weight
cons questionable durability questionable customer service lack of a back/forward button setup in web browsers i checked razer synapse nothing
pros solid durability and customer service dedicated back/forward buttons for web browsing better build quality more ergonomic design
cons release date is almost 3 years ago 20 cad more expensive shorter warranty 1 vs 2 years mouse is heavier in weight non-replaceable battery
cons release date is almost 3 years ago 20 cad more expensive not heavy but not light either
pros cheaper price 79.99 2 year warranty more reputable than razer recent release date
is it worth shelling out an extra 20 cad for a reputable brand like logitech ?
i 'm worried about razer 's durability even if i have the trackpad as backup input device for my surface book 3 .
i would also appreciate other good 1000 dpi bluetooth mice options if others exist .
edit i 've added logitech g603 and corsair harpoon rgb wireless to my list of options .
i 'm a teenager who for about a year now has been very interested in physics and pursuing it as a career but recently i 've been a little overwhelmed after looking at the amount of different specializations in the field .
i 've been primarily interested in theoretical physics and studying the universe and things like relativity quantum mechanics string theory and quantum loop gravity .
similar to what physicists like hawking penrose sean carroll brain greene carlo rovelli did/do .
however i 'm not sure exactly how working in this specific way is accomplished since it 's a bit of a vague and niche role in physics .
how does it work with college majoring and specialization ?
and where and at what institutions is this work best carried out ?
i wanted to make a bot but i wondered what is allowed and what not .

things were simple in the middle ages no darwinism no evolution not this chronology of our earth billions of years old people thought the earth was like 8 000 years old and there was only one earth created by god turning around the sun and we used to be his cherished creature .
when i think of the vastity of this infinite universe i feel i 'm losing my faith .
like how could we think we are god 's special creature when we know we are the result of billions of years of evolution and we are lost on a little dust in the middle of an infinite and scary space .
it makes me feel dizzy and melancholic ... like the bible and our faith in god seem so little in comparison with the immensity of this dark silent and empty universe .
we humans once god 's special and cherished creatures are just little guys lost in the middle of nowhere .
never smoked a non filter so bear with me this might sound like a stupid question but is there something that holds the cigarette for you so that you can make it last longer if you hold it with your hand a lot of tobacco would be left behind
last night our fridge decided to give it up ... when it 's plugged in it just clicks constantly .
no one services lg around here but research suggested the start relay ... and an appliance repair shop suggested the supco rco410 to replace it .
i 'm not sure i 've got it hooked up correctly though ... based on videos it looks like i take off the connector on the compressor .
three prongs there ... the two black wires get hooked up to the existing capacitor .
the other three wires get connected to the compressor .
black wire on the bottom white wire towards the back red towards the front .
hopefully the explanation makes sense if anyone has any ideas what else could be wrong or if i 've hooked up this replacement part completely wrong please let me know .
is the mutation removed according to the order u get them ?
i 've noticed the bottom most mutation is removed first .
i plan on buying 200usd worth and let it sit there in binance or just buy btc and hodl ?
i noticed as of late that true beauty is an absolutely booming comic that is widely popular among every webtoon platform .
this piqued my attention so i decided to give it a go .
now i do n't want to come off as rude or narrow minded but after looking through the chapters i ca n't help but wonder why it is so popular .
the art is absolutely beautiful and i absolutely fell in the love with the style .
but even that is n't enough to stray away my attention from the actual plot itself .
part of me expected for it to be an story about an girl finding her true beauty '' hence the title .
although i know in korean it 's called secret of the goddess but instead we 're given an run-of-the-mill love triangle with an painfully common emotionally constipated boy and then average second lead syndrome .
the characters do n't seem to be fleshed out at all and are all just attractive but hollow characters with nothing underneath the surface .
and yes i understand that the other boy is proclaimed as tsundere '' and he has his soft parts '' but c'mon how many times have we seen that trope in animes and webtoons ?
it should n't even count as an trait anymore .
she 's painfully self conscious and air-headed and does n't seem to even have an ounce of self worth .
i maybe can see how the author created her so others can relate to her self consciousness but those type of mcs always tend to be annoyingly innocent .
plus there 's absolutely 0 character growth in the mc and all she can think of is the guys around her and her looks .
it painfully reminds me of an korean version of twilight .
the author throws in too many typical tropes and scenarios in there that i could easily find in a million different shoujos .
the mc is so airheaded and ca n't seem to understand that both of the guys like her hence leading them on for an unsaid amount of chapters .
the whole entire story is just so incredibly empty and hollow .
i ca n't help but feel dissapointed especially since the comic and so popular and i was expecting for from it .
that 's why i ca n't help but question why ?
for those of you who do enjoy it i 'm interested as to why you do like it .
i used to be so good at spelling i would hardly ever misspell anything .
i 'm currently in college but i have n't taken an english class in over 3 years nor do i read for fun anymore .
i keep finding myself misspelling words i 've never spelled wrong before .
i accidentally write attached '' as attatched '' tomorrow '' as tommorrow '' and so on .
could this be because i have n't taken english classes in years it 's my native language btw ?
is there anything i can do to improve my spelling other than reading more often ?
i know that reading books is probably my best option here but i just do n't really enjoy reading for fun anymore
i literally made a reddit account at 27 years old just to ask this stupid question .
in the game you play as a mech pilot and fight face to face '' against another mech each level i think you may have been able to use a tv gun but i played this on an emulator so idek the platform honestly .
all i remember is that you can not see your character you have a crosshair/aim thing om the screen that you move around to shoot at a moving enemy robot target
so i did darkshade 1 time on normal and got it first try ... now iam doing vollenfell normal for the 22nd time and havnt gotten the lead yet .
if you ca n't put a mask on and go vote than that 's too bad .
voting by mail has the ability to create a huge amount of fraud .
now a block chain style voting system where i can check my vote when i feel like it .
now that 's a system i would be ok with .
they know they could easily develop something relatively quickly that would at least be documented but that 's not the goal here .
how anyone does n't see what 's going on here i just do n't understand .
you mean deceased child rapist murderer and cannibal mark zuckerberg ?
i overseeded some tall fescue and i think that 's what most of this is but i could also be way wrong

any teenager entitled enough to gamble 10k i honestly doubt he truly earned in the first place and take full advantage of his parents promise is a spoiled brat imo .

there were a couple of albums that really changed my trajectory as a music fan .
it had as much to do with my age at the time as the music .
black star black star fugees the score wu tang the w tha mexakinz tha mexakinz
first time i heard real rap over great boom bap beats .
i was young and did n't understand how much better these albums were than most rap albums .
first time i heard pete rock i realized that underground hip hop was really fucking cool .
did n't know beats could be so dense and nuanced until now .
madlib changed everything that i understood about hip hop with this album .
it was so weird and unconventional but the beats were addictive .
after years of being strictly an underground snob this was the album that made me want to listen to mainstream rap again .
and ross 's light entertaining subject matter finally made me lighten the fuck up and just enjoy hip hop regardless of labels .
this is n't an album but it was the first really good hip hop mixtape i heard and the techniques he uses blending mixing scratching mashing blew my wig .
i could n't even understand what was going on .
trump does n't care about the historical significance behind the phrase .
if he did know about it literally nothing would have changed because he 's an unrepentant racist and evil person .
i just think he 's no where near knowledgeable enough to have know/remembered that phrase while miller loves explicit dogwhistles .
i am the foremost if not only international perspective-giver thankyouverymuch .

i guess it 's the lo-fi production even the central narration was just recorded using a macbook microphone .
if you close it you would lose out on the available credit and it might drop your credit score but probably not by much .
if you never use it citibank will probably close it on you after some time anyway .
the fact that you saw the loan to term is the most important part here i believe .

i was in vegas last june and it did n't reach triple digits .
highest i got was immortal 3 but i was testing a ton of different sens as i knew the rank would get reset .
and to be completely honest i have moved on to a different routine as i feel i outgrew this one .
imagine it was an old greasy dude and a young girl .
while i love gang beasts the camera only following one person is n't as fun as we missed ryan 's final victory with the booty kick simply because jeremy was still alive

any reason why the first and third pics are bad ?

it can sometimes make me tired on saturdays but no other side effects .
this is probably the only sane comment in here .
i do n't know how this rioting and looting can be justified .
they 've already destroyed countless jobs small businesses and housing .
burning down someone 's business or low income housing was n't meant to help anyone .
all those bigbox retail stores might just pocket the insurance money and not come back .
its going to be incredibly difficult for a city/state already going through the financial losses caused by covid-19 to rebuild and they 're not going to get much sympathy from the federal government either .
not to mention property values are going to drop dramatically and businesses will be scared to invest in the community now which will only perpetuate poverty and crime .
and history has shown that places that have been rioted struggle to recover economically afterward so this will only hurt those who lived there for years .
okay guys what have i said about terminating scps without overseer permission ?
i actually mapped the left trigger with a long pull to keep me safe from my own geology cannon ...
they could have atleast given her own home like a villager in this game so we could see more of her charming personality she just feels so limited as a character and the fact that there are less npcs in this game than in new leaf just seems so bothersome .

you could might argue that annie had a bigger impact on jeff but if not agreed abed haf the bogfest impact on jeff and troy .
but when you think of character devolopment jeff moved a lot more because of abed than troy did .
troy had both shirley britta annie jeff and even pierce to learn him to grow as a person .
jeff 's personal problems mostly were britta whom stuck her nose where it didnt belong or annie whom were mostly a love interest .
but i think abed touched jeff in a whole other way 🤔🤷‍♂️

i talked with one of my friends on facebook who applied for the extension..
he said you just click on the link on the main screen on the unemployment site when you login..
your balance has to be 0 for you to apply.. mostly everything is already filled in..
they ask when was your last day at work and they also ask if you can be called back to work..
someone else also told me today it only takes a few days for it to go through..
so apply as soon as you claim your last week and their most likely wo n't be a delay in any of your payments .

if ahh.. open about racism means gunning down a guy jogging in broad/open daylight.. then yeah you guys are open as .
not really sure you can quantify other places that are way more racist than the usa.. guy gunned down jogging ... unarmed black lady killed in botched raid.. and now george floyd rip .
and the cherry on the cake.. the biggest disgrace for a world leader since.. well ahh that bush guy .
hate to break it to you mate.. there are n't too many more racist countries than yours at the moment .
well he clearly was n't going to be a pro in valorant ...

cowards lol all these guys would be wimps without that badge
everybody says people should protests peacefully but when they do ?
the obvious one everyone is pointing to is colin kaepernick who has peacefully demonstrated a protest to this very specific thing for years .
what was trump 's response and so many other 's response then ?
these violent protests are not the issue the issue is the inequality fear and everything else that drove these people to violence .
nobody wants to go ride up on a government building and raze it so how did these people get to this point ?
because nobody has given a fuck about the peaceful protests or they fire tear gas at them and when a society pushes people to their brink they 're going to snap .
of course nobody should be doing violence in protest but when police officers fire tear gas at peaceful protestors and cause violence ?
yeah that 's gon na cause some violence because it is unfair and unjust .
trump 's response to mention he 's sending the military then say when the looting starts the shooting starts '' is not comforting at all .
i doubt the other texts explain what he implied but even disregarding my own opinion that is just a factually stupid thing to say .
also rodney king is not remembered as rodney king the guy who started those riots with his death . ''
he 's remembered as a visceral depiction of inequality in america that people rioted over and changed the course of american history .
the same will be for george floyd and ahmaud arbery .
when you say it that way i am at a loss .
no i am not trolling i am being serious .
when you say it 's a mistake after tragedy all i can envision from this is the worst case scenario .
this man raised me my whole life me doing this to him is just wrong .
thanks so much for the reply so i guess i just tough it out with rrtk then !
did it with the 91 ovr clay matthews late last year .

you could probably save the save if you cleaned it first but i would n't bet on your followers working right afterwards .
i like for someone to just play with my hair until i fall asleep .
yeah i would n't worry too much either way .
the game is pretty good about keeping story beats intact and sensible no matter what you 've been up to .
adventures get explained in lore you not going to camp for days gets people worried about you arthur will rarely act like he 's never seen places that he 's been to before etc .
they can die but as you noticed they 'll get better so the poor shopkeepers must have some kind of groundhog day experience with being robbed and murdered again and again but still let arthur shop there .
there is no hacks mode or god mode why not just replace it with star king kirito .
well here 's their deviantart name and i 'll let you judge if they are the right to ask for items priced up to two hundred bucks .
funny cuz the joke itself has been copied time and time again
alright sorry i just only mentioned george because he was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
yes there is a lot of injustice that needs to be answered but you ca n't go burning shit down every time this happens or the us would have been ashes by now .
you sound like a fucking nutjob yes we have a lot of work to do as a country socially in order to stop this from continuing .
though destroying the well-being of innocent lives because another innocent life was taken is the dumbest fucking shit i have ever heard .
these people who are looting are not doing it in the name of george floyd and others who fallen victim to police brutality they doing it for greed and taking advantage of an uproar right now .
the fact you even condone such actions makes me question is your mental state .
martin luther king never rioted looted or destroyed buildings due to civil injustice at the time .
he was able to institute change during his time when no one else saw it possible .
i do n't think you will accomplish anything with raising hell in every city you will just create more problems and make more people stray away from blacklivesmatter .

ooh thanks i love this aesthetic and have enjoyed all the black mirror episodes i 've watched thus far definitely gon na have to check this one out .
yeah my dad said the same when i spoke him today about all this he was born and raised in st paul and went to college and then worked at the u of mn so he spent most of his life in the tc .
ca n't say i 'm especially surprised given my own limited experience and knowledge of the mpd i used to work in downtown minneapolis so i 've had more encounters with them than i 'd have liked .
it does n't matter if the streets are public spaces '' look at the news a little more there are people smashing and burning parked cars now too i do n't see anything peaceful about that .
i do n't blame these people who are just trying to get home to panic and floor it when their cars are being smashed and dented it 's probably pretty scary for them .
it 's a very underrated episode at least here because nobody lists it as a favorite .

it 's no straw man i 'm paraphrasing your own basic assumption
you 're insinuating they were more deserving of being killed due to their criminal background

did she have a criminal background too that made her deserving of being murdered ?

seriously who at r thought it made any sense at all for your horse to stop trying to get closer when whistled when it 's still 20 yards away ?
and who thought that on top of that it should sometimes ignore your first five whistles and then kind of vaguely meander in a direction that is n't actually towards you after you start mashing the whistle button ?
like i had ten minutes of play time left to mount my horse and make a 3 minute journey and in the end ran to my destination on foot punched my dumb ass horse and then logged out late .

the battlesuits in the tau codex should never be run in their default configuration . ''
you want to read more in depth about each option .
crisis suits can carry up to 3 weapons or support systems .
one example would be 3 flamers on each suit while the most popular is 2 cibs and an ats on each suit .
always the iridium upgrade on one suit since it does n't take up a slot .
however when you buy the models you do n't get any cibs and you do n't get enough other weapons to outfit them with a single weapon type .
so in the beginning ... just leave the guns off and ask people to let you try different loadouts in your games .
the broadside must have a primary weapon and secondary weapons and it can optionally take one support system .
one good loadout is hymp primary and sms secondary with an ats system while another is the hrr sms and shield generator with the hrr replaced by experimental magna rifles .
note that the one in your list is invalid the secondary weapons are required
the riptide also has primary secondary and up to 2 support systems .
hbc and sms are good weapons but you will do well with ats and either tl or vt in the support slots .
it does n't take a shield generator since it has one built in .
stealth suits can optionally take 1 support system each but they are good because they are cheap so adding the systems is generally a bad idea .
a sg on one of them or a drone controller is the most you usually see .
when you get commander suits they run 4 weapons and/or systems .
just ignore the default loadout and fit them with cibs missile pods or fusion blasters .
there are a vast number of different options for suits but there are only a few that are actually good .
so once you memorize the good suit loadouts it 's not hard to remember them .
10 is nice but it also means rainbows are definitely going to be less valuable .
th350 will function fine without the kickdown cable but in any case it should n't affect the 2-3 shift point .
also check the vac line that runs to the trans for any kinks or cracks might just be old and brittle although if it was leaking that should in theory make it not shift .
i can think of a few things we could do to pass the time .
i would take being beaten into coma before ever voting for trump .
esoro here can you share your current pob or character ?
and it seems like lots of others did n't either .
i love this game but that is very poor boss design .
reading reddit post about other people 's shitty roommate relationship situations to make me feel better about my own crap .
i feel like you just danced around the answer to your own question .
if they need the kids to stick around to help and expect them to change their life plans to do this then they should have been asked .
right now it seems as though the parents are trying to guilt the kids into doing it after the fact .
if the pre made trailer looks this good it 's very likely the final version will look similar if not better

i had to scroll down a lot before i see some honest introspection .
i was raised in portugal and moved to the netherlands .
it 's true that the dutch see themselves as better in terms of work culture and ethics but it 's also true that nepotism is rampant in portugal and almost everyone is trying to get their way around government rules and taxes while complaining everyone is so corrupt .
in dutch we say 'hand in eigen boezem steken ' meaning southern europeans should take a good hard critical look at the situation they are in and how they got there .
having said that the 'cheap 4 ' northern countries are right to be fussy about free loans/gifts although not helping their southern neighbors in this time of need is out of the question .
but asking some critical questions along the way comes with the package .
it probably is the most realistic game there is tho in terms of different types of armor and having different damage areas on the body .

m could n't find shit on the unit makeup of the lao people 's armed forces so i 'm making this an event post as opposed to a conflict post .
intelligence has indicated that the hla has planned an imminent attack in luang prabang and thus president thongphet has ordered army deployment to the city over the course of the next three weeks to work alongside police in finding the attackers .
intelligence gathering indicates that the hla attack will come in the form of a car or truck-bomb .
as such checkpoints will be established both at the entrances of the city as well as in major intersections .
major government buildings have increased their security and the army is now patrolling the streets .
this demonstrates the most brazen action by the hla since it 's formation and sheds light upon the continued presence of insurgent forces in northern laos .
the question of the ongoing insurgency has been a relatively minute matter for current and previous lao leadership .
however news of this development is likely to increase government focus on the hla which has risen previously with offers by china to work with vientiane to eliminate the hla .
regardless of this tensions remain high in luang prabang as soldiers patrol the streets and the possibility of any vehicle being a mobile bomb has shut down activity across the city .
this is the first time since the civil war in which tensions were as high as they currently are .

wife really wants a proper camera and for us to take a few lessons in person or from a friend or youtube on how to achieve striking portrait shots so we 're ready for the newborn .
not knowing anything about cameras my research over the last couple of weeks has yielded two options dslr sl2 or mirrorless m50 .
leaning towards sl2 simply because it 's slightly cheaper here canada .
however we 're completely open on either of these or any other suggestion or brand .
our intention is for this camera to become our family camera travel with us record our experiences take great pictures as the little ones grow up and last for many years .

upington the young northern cape republic ncr is quickly forming the institutions of a modern nation state .
a 55-person council has been established as the provisional legislature of the republic made up of grassroots leaders who rose up in the nation 's independence effort .
a commission has been established to prepare and organize elections and a proper constitution in the future but given shifting populations in and out of the new country that is currently on hold .
meanwhile in perhaps a surprise the capital of the ncr has been declared as upington .
kimberley was the capital of the province while it was part of south africa though the government is likely worried about its proximity right on the south african border in the event of an attack .
orania was also in the running to become capital of the country built as an afrikaner prototype colony in the idea of creating a 'volkstaat ' .
however the racial nature of the orania settlement project and preference of a more developed city led to the selection of upington .
ncr officials have worked hard to dispel the optics of a new apartheid state or even that it is a white state insisting that its definition of afrikaner is linguistic while ceding that it does see itself as a safe haven for white south african as a matter of escaping persecution .

i 'm treating this as a bit of a diary .
so i 'm a little more ready than my husband is .
he 's not not ready just a little scared .
i mean we 're finally coming into the age where it 's not the end of all things if we get pregnant and in fact some people actively want us to .
needless to say with an impending move and my husband going back to grad school next year we 're wtt for a little bit but not long .
i recently brought up how i really wanted to be a mom despite our kind of hectic life events coming up namely moving in january and school next august .
we had a good talk about how i felt like my feelings were stupid and wrong and he felt nervous to take the first step .
all in all we decided that since we both want a kid we 're going to pull the goalie '' so to speak this september .
ntnp i think is the term round these parts .
if i immediately get pregnant first go round i 'll at least not be horrendously pregnant while we move in january .
anywho so i 'm tiptoeing into the fantasizing lately .
while we were out today grabbing some items for my husband i asked him if we could pop into my favorite home goods store cost plus world market lovers where you at ? .
as we browsed we both caught sight of the same item at the same time a wall-mounted coat hanger with beautiful wooden backing and gold painted woodland animals as the hangers .
we both agreed it 'd be perfect for a nursery .
i carried it around the store while i mulled over whether or not to get it .
i grabbed a mug i really wanted as well and my husband ever the pragmatic one says well we just spent 45 on my things .
do you want to spend another 40 on something we 'll just put in storage for who knows how long ? ''
we 're trying to budget for a move but i 'd be lying if i said i was n't a little crushed .
i 'm sure this or something close will still exist when we 're ready . ''
i keep thinking back to the posts here i 've seen of women buying one or two things for the baby in the future to help with their baby fever .

my sibling was helping my parents shop for health insurance since their medi-cal is ending soon and she haf trouble filling out the application because she does n't know certain information .
she asks me about i do n't know it she gets freaking pissed at me about it .
whenever i do answer she regards it as backtalk and threatens to fling me out the window or kill me .
that is the exact same way my parents react when they are angry or frustrated .
well not the whole threatening aspect but viewing every word as backtalk .
she complains and mocks them about it and she does it to me .
btw i posted this on the princesses of power reddit but i also wanted to see what the people here thought .
a little bit of a spoiler is it just me or do you guys want more of entrapta in a comic that shows happens to entrapta and hordak after the last episode of season five .
i am on the autism spectrum my self and have loved entrapta ever since the first season and even before i realized that entrapta was on the spectrum which i finally realized after finishing the show .
the reason why i like entrapta so much and want to see more of her in comics is because i have never seen a female autistic character in a fictional action adventure show book or movie before .
i love her personality how she is so obsessive over machines and science and how she is not good with people which i can relate to .
i also love how she looks she is cute and cool at the same time !
so she is by far my favorite fictional character ever !
and i get really sad thinking that there might not be more of her so i would like to see your guys ' opinions on this and if you agree with me .

i 've spent the last year in between working through my last year of school and building websites working on learning python and increasing my skillset for when i end up at university .
i 've already got experience with unity c and i 've gone through the basics of python variables loops functions object oriented programming etc .
i 'm wanting to take it further and go through some more courses however i have found that i work well with a gamified '' style like codecombat rather than a traditional course i have asperger 's syndrome which can mean among other things that the way i learn things and take knowledge in is often times very different to others .
i want to get some advice on what platforms apps or websites are best for me .
i am quite attached to the idea of working with codecombat partly because they offer a gamified course and also because they 're an open-source project meaning as i 'm sure you know that i can expand and contribute to the development of the product .
ultimately i 'm wanting to go into scientific pursuits and use my technological and programming skills to help that field but i 'm also wanting to learn more about software game engineering in multiple languages and machine learning .
earlier this year i competed in nasa 's open source rover competition where i worked with a team to contribute to the development of an artificially intelligent rover with collision detection using reinforcement learning through aws a large part of that was using python concepts that i quite often did n't understand and now that that 's over and i did my part i want to continue with python and am just unsure of my next step .
i 'm currently working on a project that is quite ambitious and i 'm by no means attempting to complete it by myself or quickly a games community that uses a combination of django pygame/unity games and the raspberry pi 4 .

so i am almost to the part where you can choose between sith empire and republic on the war for iokath and was wondering if choosing the republic as a jedi knight will affect the story with lana since she is a sith and i am choosing republic over sith empire ?
stage 1 parents tell me to do something that i genuinely do n't want to do and wo n't help my career/academics
stage 2 i tell them that i do n't want to do the thing
stage 3 they say fine whatever do what you want '' but you all know this line is heavy with subtext and they actually want you to do it more than anything .
and they keep harassing you with reminders about the thing
stage 4 i sense the subtext and do the thing for the sake of my sanity and the peace of the household coz i ca n't tolerate the yelling and all
they ask me what 's wrong because they seem to care and so i tell them why
stage 6 they yell at me and ask me why i do shit that makes me unhappy
stage 7 i tell them it 's for them they yell at me for blaming them and not owning up to my shit
stage 8 repeat till i am drenched in anxiety and regret

was looking around a dungeon for the precious mini boss and couldnt find him for like 30 minutes finally gave up and was curious what it was so i searched it on google for a bit and cant find a single picture of it anyone know what it looks like ?
he was british wore glasses and was always wearing purple .
the series was foul and not made for kids .
there were episodes of him doing different jobs being a superhero etc .
it was very popular i just ca n't remember what it was called .

remember when that black guy took a knee at a sporting event and suddenly became public enemy number 1 .
the bill of rights is only 10 amendments long .
if someone is that adamantly pro constitution they could atleast know all 10 of those .
it 's not unreasonable to expect that out of the people who make protecting the constitution their life 's work .

what are you saying is an exaggeration on what happened she should be with jughead someone who intellectually is in her level not with with the guy who she has nothing in common
that is still on the officer riding the horse .
the officer should be training the horse for noise light flashes explosions mobs etc .
in my country they train their steeds for all those situations and those training scenarios are way more intense and scary-looking that what was happening in this trampling video .
this is on the officer for either not training their horse right for pushing the horse beyond its limits or on him for pushing the horse to go in that very direction .

where did the buddha caste out the caste system ?
this is a funny modern thing i 've been seeing lately trying to portray the buddha as some social justice crusader .
i do n't know the mahayana and vajarayana texts so i 'll refrain from speaking to them but in the ebts the buddha quite clearly has no social agenda .
i do not see anywhere where he says anything like the caste system is evil and needs to change '' he simply does not accept it within his dhamma and vinaya and it was also something fairly common among the samanas that the buddha first went into wandering ascetics like the jains seeking awakening outside of the social structure so you ca n't even necessarily say the buddha started it .
one big glaring example i have never received a valid response for yet is if buddha was trying to change the world why would he talk about being kind to your slaves '' instead of free all your slaves '' ?

rubber bullets are designed to be shot at the ground so they bounce up and hit legs and lower body afflicting pain and superficial damage but not threatening any bodily harm or death .
police are taught that this is the correct usage of it .
if police are shooting rubber bullets straight at anyone then they are missusing their lethal equipment deliberately and risking death when they are not allowed to .
at best they have been misstaught by their superiors and are ignorantly using their deadly weapons .
unfortunately ignorance does not absolve illegal application of physical harm and death .

i think for me is the configuration of british kit .
lots of heavy belt kit and trousers made of fabric that sticks to your skin .
there also far to small around the thighs and calf and designed to be unisex .
i will now do the dance to please the gods
just smear lamb 's blood on the door while you 're at it .
i usually play trios with a friend and the ignore wraith '' thing you do is bad .
you should do like we do bet on how many seconds wraith will last before leaving .
cause the masses tell you to be a good person '' ?
what you feel is just human nature man to try to do it differently is going against your nature .
it 's good to be selfish and it 's actually a good moral to be selfish .
i was replying for how it is in the us not speaking for other countries may have lacked additional context .
always possible if you are engaging to talk to and have good habits posture hygiene health manners whatever .
just try to be someone you yourself find interesting .
yes that 's the same tear gas everyone at the un agreed ca n't be used in a war .

i hated breathless with a passion and if that 's his best film then i would n't even bother with the rest of his filmography .
hit the nail on the head too busy experimenting with film but does n't even try to be entertaining .
that part in breathless where they just have a conversation for what seems like 20 minutes was the biggest waste of time i have experienced .
the way the film was edited was just mind bogglingly annoying .

yes i know the message but why did the poster have to say can we get a hearth ?
of course they 're in dire straits we 've destroyed their jobs .
they 're cute af makes me sad they 'll get the knife cuz someone wants a kebab .
there 's been many a time that i 've had to pull up my players when playing the ffg star wars game for just saying i 'll take a boost for my next check .
that 's not how it works those are mechanical benefits from fictional circumstances it 's on them to narrate the fiction for it .
my players may just be more gamist than me .
you ca n't just pull out 3 quotes of someone saying something and go '' this defines them as a person this is who they are in their eternity and there 's nothing more to them ''
especially when they 've already apologized for and explained those things
we 've all said and done fucked up things in our lives most of us just have the luxury of those things not being caught on camera or online .
if we were to define every person by the worst thing we 've all said and done at some point in our lives we should all be cancelled .
i 'm not out here to defend a multi millionaire you can cancel him and he 'll still be fine .
but just think about what you 're doing in general we 're the generation that 's growing up online you have probably said during your years online something stupid that you regret .
you keep encouraging this type of behaviour and one day it may come to bite you in the ass too and you 'll be declared the evil one and they 'll make you lose your job and ruin your life
a crime and we expect people to be punished for it .
but i 'm more interested in why we ca n't talk about why the conditions for this chaos exist and what we can do to make things better in the future
the question now should surely be how are you being affected by protests in the us ? ...
i struggle to even call it advice it 's really just empty words .

there 's a reason the same people killing black people by stepping on their necks are sharing these false notions .
because phones are very very small nowadays the actual focal length of the lens is around 1 to 2 mm with a crop factor that equates to roughly 20 mm .
so this can lead to even more distortion as they 're essentially tiny fisheyes with a massive crop .
i 'll provide an example similar to what you addressed
similar to the gypsy rose story the original documentary/story had painted her as more manipulative and aware of what was going on around her .
however in this new docuseries '' she 's portrayed more in the victim light with people wanting her to be released from prison .
we will never know what truly went on as we were never there .
i do n't see how beerus can be better than kefla .
without it he does n't hit hard at all .
beerus relies even more on support especially whis or vados than kefla .
kefla has 10 categories so she 's way more useful .
she gains dodge which makes better defensively than beerus .
when you build the team for them her double super allows her to hit harder than beerus .
so tell me how beerus is better than kefla ?
is he stealing her money or using a joint account with their mutual money ?
wow saying i would shoot someone attacking my family is apparently being cowardly .
yes pretending you 're tough in your imagination is cowardly .
did n't realize i had to let my family die like you would to be considered a hero 😂
you did n't let them die because you 're a man child playing make believe .
you see in my imagination you did n't shoot anyone but instead offered to get to know the assailants on a emotional level .
you befriended them by massaging their backs every night and you were their little spoon their corner stone .
like an anchor you were there for them when times where hard and became such a large part of their lives that when they saw you and your family driving to applebee 's they let you go free .
they just knew deep down you could love harder than they could ever hate .
pretend land is fun you can be anything you want !
like play tough when you 're really not just like robtheinstitution .
i love how you referred to the idiot as it
lately the game kept me going has been animal crossing tbh and i was n't even the one that wanted the game in the first place .
my sister asked me to get it for her so i did and i ended up playing it myself as well and have not regretted it .
i do n't disagree that she ca n't see out of the eye but no doctor is going to say it 's permanently blind after a single surgery .
she even contradicts herself when she says she 's hopeful to see some light and shadows .
this is a grade a milking for some karma .
i wish we just saved the money and used it for a honeymoon .
the wedding was for everyone else really was n't about us .
so if someone did try and get into her salon she would kill those individuals for trying to steal or start a fire ?
my understanding of the law has always been that you are allowed to use lethal force if you believe your life is in danger but i could be wrong .
is she be legally allowed to shoot to kill to prevent looting or arson ?

our patriarchal society teaches people from a young age to act and be a certain way .
toxic femininity however is a term often used by mens right 's activists to create a false equivalence to toxic masculinity .
toxic masculinity does n't just describe the effects it has on men but also the rest of society .
this so called femininity that you describe is a result of living in a male dominated society where women are valued by their appearance .
there is already a term for what you 've faced it 's called ambivalent sexism .
the lgbtq movement also did n't resort to violence to get its point across and look where it 's at now
they have n't been productive moments of the movement though and the true progress was done peacefully
we 're ... recovering ... from my wife going overboard a couple of times recently but one thing that really put me off
my wife and i used to post to reddit last year under a different account and we found a guy 10 years younger than us who was interested .
i spoke to him a little at first but then my wife got involved and when i spoke the little shit actually said i 'd like to speak to the wife thank you. my temper flared but my wife cooled me down and i gave the kid another chance .
he ended up having my wife sneak into the bathroom to do stuff on video chat and then make a strip video for her while he also talked shit on me .
i saw to it he was out of the equation .
later i tried talking to him about where he fucked up maybe offer some pointers let him know i was n't a cuck not knocking those who are into that either .
in my experience husbands like that. maybe but you still have to communicate first .
it did bring some friction in the marriage but we got passed that .
especially when he is chilling in the corner before the brad interrogation .
people still go out even if they 're not supposed to
you know this is a great suggestion and super logical but just the thought of both of them being mixed in together makes me anxious !
which is 100 my weird brain because i am the kind of person to have like three billion tumblr side blogs number slightly exaggerated for different fandoms/themes etc xd
i honestly find it annoying not just because of the meme
here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in lgpe and sw/sh
this is prohibited by rule 4 as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public .
please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators .
since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the right person .
if you are trading shiny or event pokémon please make sure that your post and other users ' offers contain the full details https www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules .
this is to provide more visibility so you know how the pokémon you are trading for was obtained .
if you see any posts that do not have the full details please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation .

let 's allow a society that can starting with the local public servants..the police .
you login to hbo max with your yttv credentials .
how would you expect the hbo max app to be integrated within the yttv app ?
that makes no sense if you did the slightest bit of research .
while toxic feminity undoubtedly still alive to some degree the feminist movement at least here in the u.s has n't had to deal with any issues of legal equality for some time now and as a result has had tons of time to focus on social issues affecting women .
just look around the past 10 years of progressive women 's movements have been all about breaking down toxic feminity and beauty standards .
men while there may be a group of feminists who fight toxic masculinity have made basically zero progress .
men 's rights movements are n't taken seriously at all by many of the same progressives who support the women 's rights movement and once again at least in the u.s men often suffer significantly more at the hands of the federal courts than women do .
fat-shaming is stigmatized for women but not for men .
short ladies are fine but short dudes are gremlins .
tl dr feminists have helped remove toxic feminity to some degree already not so much for men .
how do i deal with players who have contracted lycanthropy ?
maybe from a cleric npc who can cast it .
maybe as a spell scroll for the wizard to use .
either way that search could be quite the quest .
on a full moon the pc turns into a were-beast and tries to flee into the night !
the other pcs can try to stop him but he will fight back and you can let the player fight with the werebeast stats if you want .
or will he slip free for a night of bloodshed ?
if a lycanthrope pc does escape from the party they may be motivated to track him down before he does anything awful .
if the local townsfolk notice that the pc is a lycanthrope do n't expect them to just accept it .
if the player wants to accept the curse as per the monster manual it should n't be an easy thing .
maybe it involves struggles asserting his willpower over that of the raging beast .
maybe the party will help him through this process ?
maybe there 's a reclusive community of lycanthropes who could help ?
be careful allowing a pc to be a lycanthrope .
do not be afraid to say it 's not allowed or to cook up a version less powerful than what the monster manual suggests .
this could be for a number of reasons most of which are summarized in the rules text on the right .
in most of these cases the computer is right and we will not overturn its decision .

if you just say that you think the computer is wrong without any reasoning we will ignore you .

i 'm gon na go to autozone later today and get the code s read .
a couple different opinions i 've read on tacomaworld suggest it could be couple things
clamps and tube/hose on new cold air intake could be issue which is my 1st guess .
a dirty mass airflow sensor which require a very careful cleaning .
possibly bad gas as i did fill up yesterday-but i do n't feel this is what actually happened .
he would rather have gove who worked for him pre-politics and is thus more amicable to his wishes .
i wish that clip was more widespread she tells him that her family was murdered and him not barely paying attention goes so where are they now ?
she looks at him aghast for a second before you can tell she can barely believe it 's real life that she has to say ..they 're dead. .
and proceeds to ask her how she got a nobel prize just for writing about this ? ''
and then goes on to word vomit about how he does n't have a nobel prize .
he is an integral point in these austin protests.. an unarmed black man killed by police in austin this year .
these kinds of things happen all the time all across america .
while these protests have brought out some anti progressive people the vast majority is focused on the issue at hand .
you are so ignorant man no city is immune to these issues.. and please explain how the rioting in boston did n't initialize a turn of events that ended up in the revolutionary war..
this one incident with george floyd is n't why people are protesting .
you are truly misguided this is one catalyst of an enormous impact problem in our society .
the rest of the developed world does n't have this issue .
your ignorance exceeds my expected disappointment.. coming from a typical conservative person.. which probably matters to the likes of you

i find it does n't help to call them insane .
i try to engage with them as often as possible .
we often have similar ideas just different ways of getting there .
of course some of them are just trolls or legitimately bad people but i try to look at them as people doing their best .
try to show them that the things they want will be achieved with a democratic leader and they will be more persuaded than if you call them insane .
omg ... are you meaning a word only could have just a single meaning ?
great well if he finds the brand more to his taste who am i to judge !
i do n't think there 's a shelter nearby though and he has been visiting me nightly for food for quite a time now so the wound is almost healed now .

just so you know only destiny viewers talk the way you do .
you sound like a moron who thinks he 's enlightened by an obsession with logic .
the amount of vulgarity he was throwing around did n't really help much so you did the best you could the guy was obviously getting a bit under your skin .
get familiar with the one niche and focus on selling products in that niche first .
a good tool you can use is zik analytics ... it works a treat .
also you can do this method from amazon ebay .
buy cheap on amazon and up sell on ebay .
for example you can buy nintendo switches for 450 retail price and up sell them for 620 on ebay
i like this it 's obviously a very strong turn 2 though .
think of questing beast coming down turn 2 and how insane that is .
maybe make it a 2 ability so you could use it once but not again the next turn .
i agree it 's imperfect but the author did say she changed up something like the dorms and bakugo not getting kidnapped to fit her story
however i do kinda wish she had kept it ?
honestly it wouldve been kind of cool to see ururakas reaction to him getting kidnapped if they were dating at that point and it 's not like they wouldnt have had a place to do their thing bc she lived alone at the time but i 'm overall happy with the story they did have .
i wish that shindo didnt even get the little bit of redemption he did have .
overall i like it especially the epilogue bc im a sucker for weddings .
i do n't disagree with you but honestly how would having a gun help in situations like this ?
you would instantly be to paraphrase the cops in this video lit up ''
if you deny the existence of something then you do n't have to deal with it .
some people do use their intelligence to cover up or hide their emotions .
it is called intellectualization where reasoning is used to block confrontation with an unconscious conflict .
elio used his intelligence quite well to explain away his emotions until oliver showed up in his life .
the goal is to try and have a balance in your life where you can be able to feel your feelings without feeling threatened .
you said that overall you are a happy person so it sounds as if you are already developing a good balance .
the great thing about empathy is while you may be able to feel the pain of others you are also able to feel their joy .
this was the advice elio 's father gave to him in effect do n't kill the pain nurse it feel it and with it the joy you felt .
one last thing you describe yourself as a queer person who is unable to come out '' .
everyone has their own time for revealing who they really are .
if you are having any conflict with this there are a lot of people to talk to about it .
talking things over with others can be a great stress reducer .

you guys act like losing 35 million jobs in a global pandemic is just some casual thing that the country should be able to easily absorb .
someone with a history of mental illnesses that are known to be deadly to themselves and others should n't have access to weapons that make them more effective .
but there are substantial progressive elements always pushing for greater restrictions .
assault weapons bans red flag laws and magazine capacity restrictions is a large amount of infringement to combat 300 rifle deaths per year .

this corruption has gone on long enough and someone needs to put a stop to it .
let 's see how badly-received it is over there lol .
if you want a joint account i would personally make a third budget in ynab for it exclusively .
in each of your personal budgets you would just treat the money moved there as a bill joint budget payment '' or similar .
if you do end up with separate budgets there is no good way to handle a joint account because again ynab just sees everything in ynab as one pool of money .
it 's doable you 'd have to both link the joint budget then match up categories and constantly have to make sure that the categories for the joint budget are the exact same values as what is actually in the account .
doable but a lot of double working and not fun .
we do similar with our savings and the mortgage account but only have transactions once a month for any of them so it 's easy to stay on top of .
it 's on budget but separate in a way because i keep syncing the account with the category for it .
in your case you will have far more transactions and have to do it twice once for each budget it would be a pain to stay accurate in both budgets .
you could also do this with a joint budget for all 3 accounts yours theirs joint but again you 'd have to keep meticulous track of matching main category amounts to each account amount or run into where is the money actually located '' problems .
this would be even harder with 3 accounts with hundreds of transactions a month than with one joint account which may only have 20 or fewer bills hence why i did n't suggest it in the first place it 's really not feasible .
or skip having a joint account at all and just continue splitting bills between your two main accounts as you see fit .
no matter what you do in ynab the main thing is going to be communicating though .
whether you have shared accounts separate accounts or shared or separate ynab budgets you are partners and in this together .
have budget meetings and discuss what seems fair try out a joint budget and see if it works if it does n't there is n't something saying you ca n't split it again .
i mean if you know they 're going that way then get double robo immortal production a warp prism and have a field day .
that 's what you get for wearing leather pants to an indoor motorcycle burnout rally .

i think solid rockets boosters produce much more plume and exhaust .
since the falcon 9 only has what like 8 liquid fuel engines they do n't produce as much .
the shuttle has 3 liquid fuel engines with two solid rockets strapped to the sides which did a lot of the heavy lifting early .
up close footage of the engines on the shuttle you can see the huge amount of exhaust coming out of the solid boosters and the liquid engines just appear clear .
if you want to fix it replace thermal paste with grizzly and pads too .

so recently my parents have started a company where they sell mosaic tiles online .
both my parents are at home during the pandemic however my mum also teaches from home .
my brother and i are also at home and we are both adults as well .
basically they found a place to buy glass and ceramic tiles for cheap except they come in a pretty terrible condition they have glue on them are covered in mud/dust given to them in a big box etc .
and my parents then clean them up package them put them online and send them out when people order them .
when they first started out my dad was telling me how much they would make in profit and it is quite a big profit margin and i suggested that i help as well for a percentage of the money .
now occasionally i 'll help them out with stuff i do n't mind doing such as helping collect the order setting up the website designing their business card etc .
however when they ask me to do any of the cleaning heavy lifting meticulous sorting/counting i say no .
they 've pointed out how i 'm also at home during the pandemic and whilst i do pay some lodging it is n't very high and they often say that i should help out around the house more .
on the one hand they 're my parents and they 've done a lot for me and i can see how much work they 're doing .
on the other i do n't see how it 's fair that they can ask me to do part of the work when they flat out told me i could n't get in on the business .
it 's still only a few months old but when you 're told multiple times that they can spend 300 on tiles and then turn that around to be about 10,000 and still be one of the cheapest sellers online then it makes me feel a bit bitter about being asked to work for free .
i 'm having trouble knowing if i should help them out because they 're my family and they 've done a lot for me or if i 'm justified in not doing so .
whenever i am trying to install a package i am getting this error .
i even tried updating to 20.04 from 19.10 but when i am upgrading i got the same error .

tony has done a fantastic job getting everything done but there is still some more to do and he expressed that sadly right now with the crisis and economic uncertainty he needs to take on a more full time role that pays hourly/salary to cover his expenses .
he did atleast 80 of the work already so the question i have is how do we proceed ?
if so how do we reward tony for the work he has completed ?
do we wait for everything to settle with the world and for tony to be able to work on it again ?

none of my friends play so i have to queue up with randoms .
it seems like every teammate i get has 2 brain cells .

any feedback for how i can deal with bad teammates ?
it has never happened to me in about a 1000 hrs of gaming .
healing in this game has gotten abundant and absurd at least from someone playing since season 3 .
greivous wounds at the moment barely puts a dent into all the healing sources seen through runes itemization and innate healing from kits .
with ocean drake and it 's soul being a thing that exists in the game i do n't think it 's crazy to suggest that it should be considered one of the strongest healing methods in the game as a reward to teams who take objectives into account .
no other healing source should compare but sadly it 's possible to drain-tank enemies as an adc or melee carry using just runes and a death 's dance .
it 's also possible and extremely frustrating to see a yuumi heal their ally by about 1/3 of their hp through a greivous wounds debuff while the ally tops off 50-100 hp every few hits because of how accessible it is .
now i 'm not saying to completely gut healing outside of ocean drake but what i am saying is that healing from sources outside of ocean drake and it 's soul should be considerably less volatile .
hell it is a game changer but if everyone can obtain it and the methods to slow it down are costly and barely dent the multiple sources coming in then it becomes too hard to balance .
tl dr nerf rune and itemization healing buff greivous wounds and make ocean drake the game 's big healing factor to help determine the games that it 's in .

due to the pandemic had to settle on some different parts but i 'm happy with what i ended with .
there is a phrase that has been assumed to come from a chinese proverb that goes like this
the twisted tree lives its life while the right tree ends up in planks .
if you have heard of it it is actually paraphrased from a piece called zhuangzi from a contemporary writer lao-tze .
i found an article about it recently on a chinese language learning site https www.echineselearning.com ? ecl=pteeeeee pla=reddit20200501-meg-answer-the-twisted-tree-lives-its-life-while-the-right-tree-ends-up-in-planks-in-mandarin that i study with and wish to give credit to for the information .
the part of the story referencing the tree goes like this
i have a large tree people call the ailanthus .
its huge trunk is covered with so many knotty lumps that a carpenter 's measuring tools could n't find the middle of it .
its small branches are so bent that a carpenter 's ruler could n't measure them .
it stands there spreading out in so many directions that a woodsman would n't even take notice of it .
just now sir you used words that are so big and useless most people would ignore them .
sir have n't you ever watched a lone bobcat or weasel ?
it stays low to the ground crouching down waiting for something to unwittingly stroll by .
jumping up high in all directions not being able to avoid what is above or below preoccupied with a sense of invulnerability it then gets snared and dies in a hunter 's net .
then there 's the adult yak which seems to be as big as a cloud in the sky .
you sir have a large tree and are worried that it 's useless .
why not transplant the tree from your own neighborhood into the vast wilderness .
there you could pace back and forth next to it while doing nothing .
without a care in the world you could lie down under it and go to sleep .
neither an ax nor hatchet would threaten its existence .
what 's truly useless should be able to get some peace and quiet ! ''
the story holds a more profound significance than the quote you posted .
the way that the first person talks about the useless tree '' seems as though he is saying that it 's beneficial to be worthless because if nobody needs you nobody will use you up '' so you will grow older than the tree that was perfectly useful to craft with .
however this was actually just meant as the first person is complaining about the useless tree in his garden .
rather the story wants to say that the reply of zhuangzi is wise and says that we should n't judge so fast what 's useful '' and what 's useless '' .
he suggests that if something is considered useless at first glance it may just have a hidden strength and potential that we ca n't see yet so if we think something is useless we should give it more space to see what comes of it .
on the other hand he might also say that if something is useless just get it out of your way so it wo n't bother you '' but at the same time he orders him to go to the tree regularly .
then again it 's open to interpretation as we ca n't ask the author now .
it really gives a peek into fascinating ancient chinese culture .
i 'm very selfish because i do n't wan na share ideas except basic ones which i thought they are unique .
i have no idea about myself because i feel like i 'm going in wrong direction .
i guess he was semi live tweeting her show in ny and at one point just tweeted thickums petras which i thought was v funny at the time for whatever reason ... . months later it 's still stuck with me .

as the title says i need a road map to t3 gearing what route is fastest what route is easy ... . etc help me
edit1 im 585 right now i need the path to 800 ilvl
edit2 i found this on discord with help of raizoir
he did n't want to come fast so i asked do you want to fuck me with my dildo ?
so i grabbed my dildo and a box of condoms .
he put a condom on the dildo and ... another great time .
at this point i 'm ready for him so we have sex .
i assumed he we as wearing a condom as i threw the whole box at him literally with the dildo .
taking about pros and cons of our sexual adventure and he laughs and says baby number two !
he said yeah i came inside you i told you remember .
which he did but i thought he had a condom on .
and he said he will buy plan b but i have epilepsy and take medication that interferes with hormonal birth control .
i did previously have an i.u.d a few years ago but it somehow shifted or something and was extremely painful so i am not on any birth control .
i do n't know what made him think it was okay .
i told him he had to sleep on the couch tonight .
my mind is racing on what the hell is gon na happen .
my period ended a few days ago so now i 'm going to pray it comes back asap !
i 'm so hurt he was n't wearing a condom .
like why put one on the dildo but not yourself ? ? ?
i 'm so hurt i do n't know if i 'm over reacting or idk .
right now i 'm thinking i want to break up .
i 'm in no mood to talk to him right now .
i told him i was hurt and he reassured me he would buy plan b when it might not even work ? ? ?
i ca n't think of how i am even going to get past this .
i do n't understand why he was n't wearing a condom .
does he not care for me or my well being ?
was it just a heat of the moment thing ?
whereas bug bounty programs have been successful in the past with identifying vulnerabilities in the countries major sites
whereas the country has been the victim of multiple successful cyber attacks
whereas identification and later patching of security vulnerabilities only works to ensure national security
whereas bug bounty programs cost fairly little for the nation as a whole
whereas security adaptation is necessary if the country hopes to succeed in a new technology focused era
this act may be cited as the cybersecurity vulnerability assessment act
a establish a bug bounty program much like the one made by the department of defense in 2016 to find vulnerabilities in the countries defense databases to prevent further cyberattacks from other nations
a the hack the pentagon program was successful as it produced 138 valid vulnerability reports with a small fiscal footprint of 150,000
b throughout the 21st century the united states has been consistently targeted by foreign adversaries and many targets have succeeded
c the united states is not prepared for full scale cyber warfare that the world is moving towards
d the hack the pentagon 's success suggest expansion of the crowdsourcing concept in efforts to secure the nation from further attacks
1 the secretary of defense and secretary of state assembled are to create a bug bounty program similar to that created under the hack the pentagon initiative https dod.defense.gov/portals/1/documents/fact_sheet_hack_the_pentagon.pdf created in 2016
a within 1 year of passage the two secretaries shall
i work to select a reliable firm capable of receiving over one thousand 1,000 participants to host a bug bounty challenge
ii identify online functions of the departments they oversee that may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and aggression by foreign adversaries including but not limited to department employee databases and classified document archive sites such as the federal depository library program 's site
iii work with the attorney general to ensure that participants in the bug bounty program are not guilty of crimes under regarding acts of cyber aggression
iv create a clear timeline for the program including a termination period in case of major failure as well as potential program expansion in the case of major successes
b the program should accurately record participants vulnerabilities vulnerability patches a classified threat assessment provided to the two secretaries and the potential for expansion of the bug bounty program
c 300,000 from the department of defenses budget shall be allotted to provide a reward to the bug bounty participants and for general administration
1 this act is to go into effect one 1 month after passaged
2 severability if any provision of this act or an amendment made by this act or the application of a provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid for any reason in any court of competent jurisdiction the remainder of this act and amendments made by this act and the application of the provisions and amendment to any other person or circumstance shall not be affected .
3 implementation the secretary of state and secretary of defense may establish the necessary regulations to make effective the provisions of this act .
debate on this piece of legislation shall be open for 48 hours unless specified otherwise by the relevant house leadership .

hello i am in search of a math tutor to help me with multivariable calculus .
i will be a junior in the fall of 2020 and am looking for a roommate for the year .
i am on the tempe campus and am a business sustainability major .
i have recently become more serious about my studies and want to room with someone who is also serious about that as well .
it would be great to have someone who is also a business student who i can study with .
i currently live at rise and would n't mind continuing to live here .
please reach out to me if you are interested !
i first noticed it when i saw the bulge in your shorts ...
there was no way that it could actually be that long .
you must have stuffed it in order to try and impress somebody ...
are conversation continued but my eyes could not help but flicker down to it every now and then .
it was so prominent that it demanded my attention .
when i would look back up to your face you would have a smug smirk as if you knew exactly what i was looking at .
you adjusted yourself slightly so that the fabric of your shorts gathered around your bulge and the outline became more clear ...
i could practically make out the bulging head from how constrained it was .
this time my eyes stayed on it for more than a flicker ...
i gazed at it wandering how you could have possibly stuffed it in a way that made it look so cock like .
he provided everything that i ever needed but he just did n't have a cock that was as big as yours appeared to be .
it intrigued me ... what would it feel like in my hands ?
i started to mumble an excuse about how i needed to leave as i had some important errand that i had forgotten about but there was no way you were going to let me go .
you knew the effect your bulge was having on me and you wandered what a glance at the real thing would do to me .
in one quick movement you pulled your shorts down to free your monster cock from its fabric cage .
it sprang free proudly and almost seemed to defy gravity .
how could something so long and heavy be pointing out straight from your body like that ?
the shock was clear on my face from the way my eyes widened and my jaw slackened .
i used all my will power to look away from it and i asked you to cover it back up but you knew there was no going back from here .
your cock bobbed and twitched as if it was calling back to me to have another look ...
i just could n't say no ... my eyes fell back onto it and you taunted me with it .
you placed your hand at the base and you began to swing it around ...
i did n't even notice how the saliva had been building up in my mouth this whole time ...
some had escaped out the edge of my mouth ...
i am looking to play a scene out along these lines where i just ca n't resist your cock .
it will be so bad that i will eventually drool over it .
the idea is to start from the beginning again but for us to follow something along these lines but in a little more detail with a dialogue going back and forth between us as you try to convince me to give into you .
i was thinking that my character will look something like this
i think that she could play as a younger or older age depending on our relationship .
what that relationship is is completely up to you .
there are so many possibilities as to who you and i could be .
would you want me to be your step mom ?
anything that you can think of or desire we could play as .
my only preference would be that i am either in a serious relationship or married so that i have more of a reason to try and resist your cock and when we get down to it i love cheating .
along with cheating my other favourite kink is a big cock as i am sure you can tell from the prompt .
other things that i am into include lots of cum hypnosis taboo relationships ageplay blowjobs and many more .
my only limits are no toilet stuff and no violence although you can be a little rough later on if that 's what you are into .
so if this interests you please send some ideas my way and we can either jump into it or discuss it further .
the most important thing to do if you want to play is to put a little effort into your first message so i know you will throughout our roleplay .
just because you send the first message does n't mean that we will end up messaging any further .
thank you for reading and i hope to hear from you soon !
i 'm looking for more suggestions for books my sister would like as a gift but i have a hard time because i do n't have a lot of time to read and when i do i have a very different taste in books from her so i do n't know what she would like and i have n't read most of what she does .
favorite authors are neil gaiman and elizabeth may tamora pierce and margaret atwood .
some of her favorites are inkheart the glass castle silver linings playbook the cellist of sarajevo anna karenina the unincorporated man series and the book thief .
and of course classic fantasy like lotr got hp narnia .
she talks about liking light hearted stories with happy endings .
she likes ya fantasy and romance but not steamy ones bonus points if they 're ace like her .
she likes accessible writing styles and plot driven stories .
she really likes american history and period pieces as well .
she also likes a cottage-cozy or hedgewitch vibe but obviously goes for all sorts of settings and eras .
she is practical and logical and prefers less poetic/philosophical writing .
i 'll update with more details as they come to me .
so as part of my road to try to better my anxiety which has been pretty bad for the past couple of weeks i 'm making an effort to relax more to try to reduce stress .
i 'm currently doing yoga up to once or two a day when i feel an attack coming on which has been really helping .
however there are moments when my arms and legs feel so heavy and limp that my body starts to freak out .
my husband told me that 's me relaxing but i 'm so use to being on edge or uptight that when i do manage to fully relax it 's scary .
also recently during a moment of intense stress i completely shut down in the car .
i could hear and process things but i just felt indifferent and almost did n't realize my body was almost completely numb .
when i got out of the car i felt so bad i felt like i was having a stroke or something .
i think my body is putting in more effort to relax as much as my mind is to the point it 's almost forcing it to happen .
it 's the strangest thing that relaxing causes me to freak out sometimes just because it 's something i 'm not use to anymore .
i use to be so relaxed and chill but now being that is almost terrifying .
hopefully this will pass once i start getting use to it again but until then i just felt the need to talk about it .
do n't want much just some bells so i can possibly expand my house .
i 'm one of the people that appears to have 2 ppp approvals .
one from a small bank hope credit union bank and the second from credibly which just sent my approval email this morning .
i have n't signed loan docs with either so i 'm trying to pick the best one .
i 've encountered an issue where a sound in a synth will play the length of the note in the pattern .
however if i shorten my pattern the note will still play the length of the note .
wondering if anyone else has had to deal with this .
i just rewatched the argument between lily and marshall in season 9 and noticed that every time lily runs out of the room i just get frustrated .
every time i ca n't help but feel sorry for marshall because i think that lily is treating him unfair .
he accepted the offer behind lily 's back but i still think that lily has no right to put her dream over marshall 's dream .
i feel like marshall has a big iou for the time lily just left him for san francisco .
i also know that you should n't have something like an iou in relationships but lily can never make up for the pain she inflicted on marshall .
that is my point of view ... what is yours ?
recently i 've been making a glycerine 'toner ' which works really well at hydrating my skin but seems to leave my skin a little bit tacky/sticky ?
i 'm using glycerine and distilled water at a ratio of 1:10 roughly .
i wonder if i 'm using too much glycerine ?
is there anything i could add to make it feel less tacky ?
would adding a few drops of an oil help ?
it 's my first time posting here and i 'm excited

what do i do with all these bins labeled property of united ststes post office ?
they all closed from the rona and this bins do n't sink in the river well or burn easy inside my apartment .
i 've tried almost everything in this game and i 'm bored .
i 've invaded ten thousand times and over who knows .
i should 've stopped half a year ago but i returned one final time to finish my pure spell pvp build hex/sorc/pyro/miracle and see it reach it 's maximum potential .
if you allow me to boast it really did .
i won almost every round in bob arena even against people with rank3 aura with only spells no melee weapon no 1shots no css spam no soulmass just variety and uniqueness tricks combos and binoculars that 's what i like .
i died countless times adjusting this build and even if some1 bests me it 's fine because my goal is n't just to win but to win creatively .
i ca n't think of anything else interesting i could try .
there are some ideas but they are not my taste .
i drained the creative potential of this game at least the parts that appeal to me .
the second reason is that i seem to like the ds3 pvp more .
i like ds3 's combat speed and how it doesnt punish you as much for mistakes because that allows for some creative high risk/reward plays to happen much more frequently than in ds2 .
i absolutely hate that gankspanks and comebacks are so hard in ds2 .
even i a big ds2 fan have gotten tired of its clunkiness .
now the sad part is i ca n't run ds3 on my computer so i 'll just go play something casual and take college more seriously .
it has been welling up inside and now my decision is final .
if i could forget and start again would but i can not unlearn .
i 'm pretty proud of this last build it if i may say .
i thought i 'd feel much more victorious but i feel very little right now maybe a faint tingling contentedness .
it feels like reaching the end of a journey .

have you ever felt inadequate for both ends of the gender spectrum ?
i 've been on hormones for just shy of 8 months and i feel i 've been very confident in my transition so far .
most people i meet are accepting of me even my friends are cuddly and sweet to me .
but recently i 've just felt like i 'm not good enough for either gender .
i do n't know this could be steming from a crush i have on a friend .
during the ps2 era i never played any god of war games .
i realised that it was considered some of the best games of that generation and even all time but for some reason it never grabbed me .
i was more into other games at the time like final fantasy x kingdom hearts 1 and 2 metal gear solid 2 and 3 and resident evil 4 .
but i remember having friends who truly loved the game and would talk about them to me constantly .
and i remember feeling the excitement in the room when an orchestra started playing this grand epic piece .
once the gameplay started i was so curious to see what the game was .
the boy starts walking towards a hut and out of the shadows comes kratos .
and i myself was like oh wow they are bringing god of war back !
once the gameplay started i realised that the game was very different from its predecessors .
it did n't seem like the hack and slash games of the past .
there seemed to be a bit more nuance and strategy in the way it was played .
but the biggest thing that i noticed was how it reminded me of the last of us one of my favourite games of all time .
to have a god of war game where kratos would have a son who would humanise him more was really interesting to me .
and having that dynamic made me more intrigued in regards to the story .
alright i think i want to play this . ''
but i was n't going to buy it day one .
i thought i would buy it later down the line .
though once the reviews came out claiming this game to be a masterpiece and seeing the 94 score on metacritic i decided to immediately buy it day 1 .
and it was the best decision i ever made .
i had to pay full price for this game .
it 's one of the best games of this generation and certainly by far the most polished one .
the graphical quality of this game was on another level .
i remember going close to rocks and trees to see if there that dip at times in terms of graphics .
i had never experienced a game that was able to do this .
and be so big with so many things to do and so much to explore .
my only nitpick and it 's a personal preference was that i did n't like that the story suddenly stopped so you would have the home area open up more to do more side quests .
and for some reason i felt that was overwhelming .
of course you did n't have to do them but i kinda wish these were implemented more as it were part of the story in some ways .
loved the gameplay graphics story execution of it all making it seem like it 's all done in one shot was all amazing .
and then a few days ago i watched the raisinig kratos documentary .
i knew it had been hard for cory barlog and the santa monica studios team but the documentary gave great insight into that .
i really feel for all involved and to re-watch cory 's vlog of the night he saw the reviews was even more heartwarming .
cory deserves all of the accolades everyone involved does .
i have it currently in my top 10 games of all time and feel like with time it will rise in the ladder .
because this is n't a game to just be better it 's also about being sorry and becoming better through it .
it has amazing stats for what it does and how cheap it is .
since i 'm sure they 're the ones that put the swastika there good .

i guess if you take my original comment at face value that 's true but i would hope most people would not think that i meant it 's impossible for children to be infected or show symptoms .
all of the data shows significantly less risk in children and that there is almost no evidence of transmission from children to adults .
until there is a study that shows significant transmission from children to adults it seems clear that they are not a significant vector for the disease .
so no my sources do not contradict my claim .

so i was selling a brand new never worn dress online .
when i ordered it online i had it custom fitted based on my own measurements .
i was adding the dress to the site for resell i had published the post prematurely since i was still adding details .
almost immediately after i posted i receive a msg from someone asking if it 's still available .
i reply yes but did take notice that their location was almost an hour away .
i figure we 'd cross that bridge when we got there .
potential buyer i legitimately hate to ask but is there any way i could try on the dress to make sure it fits before buying .
which i wholeheartedly understand but it did remind me to add the measurements of the dress .
plus with more info it helps buyers determine if it 's in their size range
me it 's a custom fitted dress the measurements are in the details .
again my responses are quick as i am focused on adding more info to post
potential buyer there are a grand total of two measurements on the listing .
it doesnt tell me if it will fit or not but your passive aggressive response is answer enough .
honestly i was a bit caught off guard at the response as i did n't think i was being passive aggressive .
however i did look at their profile and saw that most of his listings was of him was posing and selling worn lingerie .
finally i just assumed he wanted to take pictures wearing dress and not actually buy .

sorry if i came across like an asshole there .

yes season 3 sheds a lot of information and has major reveals for storyline i would recommend to watch it but be prepared the ending has a cliffhanger as someone else already said .
that 's what i 've been trying to aim for .
i just feel like every once in a while the computer does n't need to use their leader card to know what 's in my hand and somehow doubles their reviver/spy cards and outlasts me .
then again that can be attributed to me having too many cards .
it always feels good to be the real you .

i 'm in my mid-40 's just got diagnosed last year after a lifetime of beating myself up over the way i do things how i could n't stay on top of things that seemed so simple for most people .
my therapist suggested i might have adhd a few years ago when i first started looking into what it 's like for women with adhd i cried so much finally i knew what was going on that i was n't alone at all in my experiences that it was n't my fault that i am the way i am .
i was very hesitant to take medication which is why i waited a couple of years to see a psychiatrist boy do i wish i had n't waited !
i spent so many years crying every day because i 'd get so overwhelmed anxious just thinking about all the things i needed to do which then prevented me from ever accomplishing anything even small tasks .
now i 'm no longer on that roller coaster of feeling overwhelmed ashamed of myself for not taking care of things .
it is such a relief to finally figure it out is n't it ? !
i do n't have any good tips because my main improvement has been calming my overactive brain not getting overwhelmed .
i still struggle a lot with remembering things with organization following through on things .
my dining tables is still covered in post-it notes with my reminders because i still have a big fear of out of sight out of mind .
though i have had some success with setting daily reminders in my phone calendar i 'm less likely to ignore them now .

any market price is the equilibrium or intersection of supply and demand curve .
if supply is reduced and demand is not also reduced the price will rise to re-establish the equilbirium .
if demand is increased supply needs to also increase or the price will rise to re-establish equilibrium .
if i have any questions they 'll be coming in a few days lol .
are there any countries at all that dont follow their colonial legacy
also odd that the closest nations to the mediterranean wouldnt use french or spanish
but those countries have/had strong ethnic and cultural hegemonic identitiy before french colonization .
they reverted to their already established roots after decolonization .
on the other hand many central african nations were far less hegemonic before colonization .
thus colonization left a stronger impact especially on the language aspect .
the colonizer produced his own version of hegemony in those countries by imprinting his language on the different peoples under a nationalistic umbrella .
and if they do n't get milked they get really uncomfortable and it can result in an infection called mastitis a really painful way to die .

the best time to start almost anything is the nova terra interregnum .
it does predate the age of apostasy i believe .
it is ideal because it is a civil war near to the scale of the horus heresy but has almost no lore defined for it other than it being loosely connected to the moirae schism maybe cypher got involved somewhere and it was in part over the increasing power of the church .
it lasted 900 years and i have basically given you all the printed lore for it in a couple lines .
go wild i start almost every chapter there somewhere .
ldr the only example of a good person that 's a catholic in my family died of cancer .
i was raised as catholic but come from a family that is a mix of atheists orthodox and evangelical not even sure if that 's the right name also .
so in a sense we had this open culture of hey what 's different in your beliefs and views of the world '' and were able to share views in a non-judgmental way .
now until about 14 i was even okay with that and simply accepted grandpa as a person does n't like being questioned in anything .
no issues with my faith whatsoever parents were trusting and relaxed enough to leave the decision up to me things like whether i want to go to church etc .
i was 14 had n't seen her for 9 months prior and in the end she refused to even communicate with her children actively sent them away or discouraged them from coming .
i took a break from church as i could n't wrap my head around this being god 's will .
i mean all the other even non-religious even bad people in the family are happy and well anfn my beloved granny who led by example had to suffer through all this ?
i tried to get back in touch with my faith after a year perhaps year and a half .
the priest taking my confession did not show any sympathy and basically told me i am a bad person for not trusting god with my grief and it should n't have taken me that long to get back to church .
that was the breaking point for me and i never looked back .

looks like new ravagers can still be found on amazon for 30
i feel like the commission fee to have someone cad model the missing turret pieces which have smart ars in them btw not just simple single pieces of plastic is probably going to be higher than the cost of just buying another ravager ... ...
i remember the tribunal there was someone who went 0/30 as teemo in 4 games .
he was overwhelmingly pardoned '' because one game he was reported for winning by the salty enemy team .
iirc older f1 games only gave you 4 flashbacks a session
in the arrowverse fixed points in time do not exist .
if something is so crucial that it would destroy the entire timeline to erase it complete such as rf a the person 's history does get erased anyway but a time rement basically a ghost left over from them continues to play the role of the otherwise erased person or event in all the crucial places .
thus the flash continues to run into him because his conflicts with the rf much always happen but the rest of rf 's life is erased .
except being a time traveler himself his remnant can cheat a bit and found a way to dodge the erasure completely .
yeah you can do that along with contacting those customers that want the food to be handed to them to let them know you will be doing no contact for their and your own safety ... it 's kinda crazy that they want contact with a dasher that 's out there exposing himself stupid on their part but you ca n't help stupid .

fit it with the 0.4mm needle/nozzle set that way its more forgiving to incorrect thinning and harder to damage then do your research .
youtube is packed full of miniature painting airbrush tutorials and learning to airbrush well is just as nuanced and detailed a topic as learning to paint well with a brush .
i 'd probably suggest that you try mixing paint and airbrush thinner together in a little plastic container/tray/etc until you think its the right viscosity to airbrush then pour it into the airbrush cup see how it sprays and adjust as needed .
once you 've actually got paint moving through the airbrush nicely no spattering blockages etc just practice building up a solid smooth colour on something .
no in theory there is not always a way to win .
most people that study chess generally agree that the final solution is a draw between black and white .
yep it 's wonderful when you get that nice combination that just works and you can both get what you want/like and be satisfied .
trust is big too it took my last gf a bit to trust she should n't feel guilty or selfish
i was accepted to dental school starting in fall and i share your sentiments .
the only reason i applied to dental school is because i did n't have the ecs required for medical school .
i 'm 100 not bragging but in undergrad i always had the highest grades in the medical type classes like immunology pharmacology pathology etc .
during a presentation at class we 're supposed to be professional '' on presenting it but our presentation is absolute hot garbage and i remember our teacher critivizing it and all that now as a coping thing i do i did that little air huffing thing while smirking and then the teacher saw it
while he 's staring at me dead with angry eyes then due to that our points deduced more than the terrible grade we already got .
i dont have much so please be kind dont trample flowers etc .

bleach with 20 volume is the best way to go .
you do n't want to leave it on over that long but all bleach needs 50 minutes .
so you do n't make the same mistake again only apply the bleach to the yellow section first .
let the bleach sit on the yellow section for 15 minutes .
when you start rinsing let the foamy bleach hit the purple section .
now you should be one shade of pale yellow .
probably at least 99 of the time what people call lazy behavior is just shorthand for something else that they dont want to look deeper into .
ex i got called lazy for waking up at 2 pm or even way later every day during school breaks turns out i have hypersomnia .
i got called lazy for napping as soon as i came home bc of a the hypersomnia and b the exhaustion of working at 200 effort all day when everyone else could get by w half that .
i got called lazy for missing events forgetting assignments dropping clubs—you get the idea—all of which could be attributed to the essentially herculean task of maintaining my grades friendships and not losing my entire mind in high school with an undiagnosed cognitive disorder that manifests as appearing lazy forgetful or scatterbrained.
this is my roundabout way of saying i had all these fears and essentially considered procrastinator and lazy 2 core facets of my personality when it turns out procrastination executive dysfunction and just because my efforts didnt always show in the same ways as everyone elses doesnt mean those efforts werent there .
however the damage i did to myself by ... .essentially gaslighting myself and minimizing my own efforts in everything because of how many people consciously or not drilled these ideas into me was pretty deep .
i answered op explaining how i had the precise same paranoia have heard dozens of adhd-pi women say the same—not one of them was proven right in that fear and i consider that a strong sign in and of itself at this point .
just wanted to say that bc i recognize that self-perception its not always or like ever the full story❤️ good luck w ur diagnoses though !

what i find problematic is the view that having any sexual desire at all is sinful .
and when you 're in a committed relationship that 's headed toward marriage the tension between desiring your future spouse and doing your best to guard against giving into those desires before you 're married is also a beautiful thing .
we know that the bible tells us to abstain until marriage and to then be completely faithful to our spouses in marriage .
where the line is before that is really something you need to talk to god about and determine for yourself .
some people choose not to even kiss their bf/gf before marriage .
others reason that they can do anything that does n't culminate in intercourse .
i encourage you to seek god on the matter and develop a personal conviction about where that line is for you .
also i agree with everyone who said that someone 's past has a lot less to do with their quality than their attitude toward sex and intimacy now .
find someone who 's on the same page as you .

if your sister is a full time teacher and is literally working 30 hours a week when she is at school there are things she needs to be doing that are n't getting done .
my daughter is a teacher and when she is at school she teaches classes for 6.5 hours a day and spends an additional 2.5 hours a day working on lesson plans and grading papers .
she has staff meetings most weeks that add an additional 3 hours or so .
i feel sorry for the kids your sister teaches because they 're getting a crappy education and for the taxpayers there because they 're paying a full time salary to what is in essence a part time teacher .

pbmcs would include macrophages dcs and even b cells .
these are capable of presenting exogenous antigens onto mhcii and in dcs in particular like someone rightly pointed out even mhci due to cross presentation .
this will enrich the antigenic protein reactive cells t cell in the pbmcs .
in this case the ifny secreting cells would be the one active with specificity to antigen protein .
note healthy donors will also have these antigen reactive cells hence they have come up with a 2 fold factor to discriminate .

from what i know about mcmaster eng 1 they have a system where you need a specific gpa to actually get into the engineering streams software and computer engineering are the hardest to get into afaik .
we have a similar thing at utm called cs post you need specific marks to get into these programs .
in terms of education quality we are probably top notch on par with uw and utsg .
we also share a internship program with utsg pey which i have heard is better than mcmasters internship program .
in another way mac eng is like number 3 or 4 in its category utm cs is like number 2 in its category so i think that says which is better .

he thinks it 's great because mummy 's surface area for snuggles has increased exponentially !
i on the other hand have to lay with aching hips for ages because i do n't want to disturb him ...
i played it as well so here it goes .
since i started my ttrpg career '' with 5e there 's going to be a lot of comparisons
tons of customization options compared to 5e mainly in form of class racial and skill feats .
in 5e your main choices are made during first 3 levels and then you 're just kinda on cruise control with the exception of picking spells if you 're a spellcaster .
3-action system is incredibly easy to understand and does n't have all this hulabaloo with bonus actions casting exceptions and whatnot .
it also makes the battle more tactical when moving is not free
in 5e there 's this huge controversy over what constitutes a target '' of a spell because it is n't an explicitly specified part of a spell .
so if in 5e i use dragon breath to let someone breathe fire as an action for some turns is it a single target spell because it buffs just one person or is it not because the breath can affect many targets ?
the whole archetype and dedication thing is easily one of the best features in pf2e .
in 5e you basically level classes separately leading to this weird mumbo jumbo of the hp of all your classes stack but you only take the maximum amount of attacks per turn rather than sum all of them and the presence of multiclassing spell slots calculators just speaks for itself . ''
in pf2e it 's all clean and neat and easy to use .
putting all that stuff together is a major pain in the ass especially when sometimes you have to reverse-engineer some mechanics and traits to understand what this or that feature gives you .
like you need to specifically look at attack of opportunity definition to learn that if your action has a manipulate trait it can be interrupted by a nearby enemy .
and if memory serves the witch had a feat that removed concentration '' trait from her cackle or something like that .
and the definition of the concentration trait is basically ... that you concentrate while doing that action .
if there was one thing i 'd change in a heartbeat about pf2e this would be it .
having to prepare specific spells in specific slots is the very opposite of fun because it 's no fun when you mis-prepare spells and dm wants you to have fun so now they are force between pandering to you or making you suck it up .
crafting rules can anybody tell me why it takes at least 4 days to craft anything ?
the encounter creation rules are very simple and effective .
thanks to leveled creatures and elite/weak modifiers it 's very easy to create just the encounter you want to happen while staying balanced .
in 5e challenge rating is just a guideline that falls apart when you use magic items feats or just multiple enemies a metric ton of slow moving zombies should be a challenge for a team of 4 level 15 adventurers ?
well two level 5 wizards just erased all of the undead with 2 fireballs .
oh my god the book-keeping the crunch the numbers .
after having dm 'd pf2e i understand why some call it mathfinder .
there 's just so many modifiers to remember and apply it 's not even funny .
i rolled a 16 and it has 6 to hit so 22 !
oh wait but it 's the second attack in its turn so i should subtract 5 .
oh wait but the claws have the agile trait so i actually subtract 4 .
hey but is n't he sickenened 1 from that guys spell so he has a penalty ?
and then we have to list all the conditions for the player check which ones stack ...
this is basically the reason why i did n't like dming pf2e .
in 5e there are n't many defined rules for skill checks .
when the players wants to do something the dm says which skill to make a roll for and decides the outcome based on the roll and his gut feeling or earlier preparation .
in pf2e there are so many definitions and results and whatnot and while i 'm free to ignore them i 'd rather add elements like in 5e than take them away like i feel i want to with pf2e .
so citta the householder went to the jain ascetic nigaṇṭha nāṭaputta where he asks whether he has faith in a state of concentration where there is no vitakka vicara ?
the point i am trying to make is if vitakka-vicara were really something different in jhana a person from a different sect would not have known it and would 've most likely clarified it .
arrest the current of the river ganges with his own fist .
imagine vitakka vicara as initial and sustained application but stopping initial and sustained application is not something extraordinary .
but when you interpret it as thought and investigation it does make sense .
stopping ones thoughts is almost impossible and the examples begin to make sense .

today the tv 's screen went out no picture but there is still sound coming through .
when i unplug the tv and plug it back in an then turn it on the tcl roku logo will display on the screen for only a split second before cutting back to a blank pitch black screen and then the bottom white light will slowly flash 24 times .
is that by chance an indicator flash indicating hardware failure ?
i also noticed that when i plug the tv back in the bottom light comes on bright for a few seconds and then goes dim though that might be normal but i 've never seen it like that before .
i was n't present at the time this first happened so i do n't know what could have caused it .
does anyone have an idea what could be wrong ?
for the make and model the only thing i can tell you is it 's a tcl roku .
not sure if there is a specific name for the model or not .
the front is pretty and has a river but the backyard has a road behind it .

my preferred art medium is pencil and/or pen hand drawings .
in the past i have occasionally scanned them and then digitally edited them on computer generally to darken/clean up lines and add colour .
i am planning to do some more art like this so was going to buy myself a good quality scanner when i started thinking about using a tablet to draw instead .
i have never used one so thought i 'd try hear from those here who might have .
basically i 'd just like to know how using a tablet compares to drawing by hand and whether there are any tablets and/or apps which are particularly good .
this is a textbook debate i know there are builds that are neither but the majority of builds are either armor or dodge
i 'm strong enough for mayhem 10 but all the weapons i 'm trying to farm are dropping only one thousand damage guns .

i will do my best to explain what i need .

ehx pitch fork for fake guitar proco rat zoom ms70cdr for delay oceans 11 for reverb .
my main question is related to my bass distortion .
my behringer bass overdrive is broken 13 years using it and its pretty much one of the best distortions i ever used .
i need a pair of distortion/od/fuzz that can stack well .
i thought of getting a ehx battalion its a di whicj allows me to retain my dry signal which is important for my sound and the overdrive has a dry/wet knob but i dont know what to add over that .
i thought of buying another behringer or boss bod bit those are ugly as hell .
so for all the bass nerds tell me two pedals that stack well together one for a mild od/dist tone and a second one for badass satan invocative tone .
so there was a series of movies with this woman who was an amateur detective more like someone who is n't a detective but acts like one while her husband-who looked older than her with white hair who was an actual detective would tell her not to get involved .
there was a scene of her on a train and seeing someone getting killed on another train or at a train station .
another scene i remember is her pretending to be a maid i think in a mansion with statues of wolves around it .
i watched this like when i was in the 9th grade which was like 8 years ago .
i really loved those movies and want to rewatch them .
i am a current freshman in college and you can tell by the title i 'm kind of in a tough situation .
this online learning has completely destroyed my grades i was doing very well beforehand and now i feel like it 's all falling apart .
i simply ca n't learn remotely i need to be in an in-person lecture in order for the information to sink in .
my professors did n't do any zoom lectures or anything we were left to our own devices .
unfortunately i ca n't teach myself chemistry and calculus from a textbook and youtube videos so my grades absolutely plummeted .
i 'm having a difficult time dealing with the failure .
i 'm going to a really good school and i 've always kind of been the smart one in high school the one everyone thought was going to do well in life .
i 'm a pre med biochemistry/microbiology major and i fear for my future .
i ca n't help but beat myself up i keep thinking if i would have done this or that or budgeted my time better i could have passed these classes .
instead i 'm sitting here with one f and one nc .
i understand that failure is something everyone has to deal with but this failure seems astronomically huge compared to others .
hello everyone so tonight unfortunately my scuf controller broke and i am in the market for a new third-party gaming controller .

i invested in ada about two years ago and have n't followed much .
last time i launched it it suggested me to upgrade to daedalus mainnet '' .
i installed that and it seems now i have two version of the blockchain and two programs .
do i need to keep both or is it safe to simply keep the latest one and delete the original as well as the corresponding folder in appdata ?
can you mount the radiator on top in this case ?
i have seen people say it is n't possible but saw a video where the guys mounts it custom on top with double sided tape .
i wanted to see if i could get your professional opinion on something ... .

i remember days spent driving around in my car going shopping hitting up all the stores and then going to a nice restaurant but it feels so very distant now .
i just bought 6 tabs 220 ug not sure if i believe that and i 'm trying to figure out howto store it .
i re-wrapped the tabs a new piece of tin foil as tight as i could put it back in the bag and sucked the air out .
then i sandwiched the tabs that are now in the bag inbetween two fairly strong magnets because the magnets are cold and to help keep air out .
i wrapped that in another layer of tinfoil and put it in a tin with two large silica gel packets .
i ca n't store it in a cold area where it wo n't get found and i need it to last until lock down is over .

if my friend has one of the race dlc packs i do n't have but play as them will they game allow that ?

i think a change in the drafting phase for ranked role queue games can give support players an added impression that their decisions have important consequences on the overall state of the game .
specifically i had an idea where all ranked role queue games had a sort of modified captains draft process .
one of the two support players would be assigned as a captain for the drafting phase and would ultimately choose their team 's lineup .
i had two ideas of how this could work based on the current hero recommendation mechanics in the drafting phase
1st idea the captain would select a specific role and it would bring up a list of 3-5 characters that the person playing that role would be comfortable playing .
after each round of drafting those people who did not have a hero chosen for their role can modify what heroes they think are good or would like to play .
2nd idea similar to idea 1 but in reverse the captain would pick 3-5 heroes and then pass those suggestions off to a specific role at which point that person could choose one of the suggested heroes or ask for another hero .
certain things may need to be built into the system like the other 3 or 4 players can override the captain if they are being unreasonable maybe took too long of a bathroom break or just really want to play a specific hero .
in professional dota i have noticed that many team captains play the support role and i think that drafting incorporates many of the core principles seen in support play .
by giving support players more of a say on overall team composition during the drafting phase more people will be inclined towards studying drafting dynamics and incentivize queueing for the support roles .
i have known my crush for three years now and i 've developed strong feelings towards her .
but about 9 months ago at our friends meeting she said that she thinks it 's too early to start any kind of relationships we 're 16 .
since that moment i managed to sort off get rid of feelings that were painfull .
but it was when i was going to a different school than she was .
i 've changed school lately and now i see and talk to her every day and i think it 's coming back .
i stopped even considering the confession but i still feel the pain and ca n't get rid off those feelings towards her no matter how much i want them to be gone .

the gun would n't even be there if the mcmichaels did n't bring them into the situation .
and i call 1000 bullshit trying to justify this as self-defense .
how are they going to claim they were acting in self-defense in a situation that they willingly put themselves in a situation that they chose to make even more dangerous by bringing deadly weapons into the mix .
if they gave a shit about their own safety they would have stayed home and called the police .
they were quite literally defending '' themselves from the situation that they went out of their way to create .
the mitb is for sure pre-taped and since that match is playing throughout the show i 'd think the other matches need to be taped to not have any big moments overlap .

i 'm also inclined to believe he would take the punishment and fight .
he literally got slammed to the ground playing vs the pistons in 4 straight playoffs .
he was a bully but i have no doubt if he was n't concerned for his body to play the next game he would fight most people he threatened .
i say most because even jordan would know fighting a center is n't gon na go well just on the basis of reach and how often centers are used to physical punishment .
this is mj guys that supreme top notch head of the pack hunter and you guys think he 's full of empty threats like some playground bully .
he was testing his teammates to make sure when they did run into a team that would back up the verbal threats with physical action they wouldnt back down and instead keep pounding the ball .
bc mj had to the same in the 80s .
am i denying he might 've used tactics like a bully would ?
no but there are different kinds of bullies those that talk and those that make sure you know they wo n't talk for long .
how vicious people are when they are anonymous particularly towards someone who is not anonymous on video .
if someone has a bad day and acts like a bit of an asshole on camera these days they can expect to be harassed about it for the rest of their life and sometimes not be able to get employment at most places .
this even happens to people who are not acting like assholes on camera but maybe just a bit cringey. like it 's so unforgivable right ?
even people who are n't even that but painted to look bad by the person posting the video i.e .
this guy totally punched a child for no reason and i started recording him right after he did it while he pretends he did n't ! .
it 's just flat-out bizarre how dumb and lacking in empathy people on the internet seem to be .

message from dr jordan peterson https jordanbpeterson.com/contact for the last year i have been receiving hundreds of emails a week comments thanks requests for help invitations and but much more rarely criticisms .
it has proved impossible to respond to these properly .
that 's a shame and a waste because so many of the letters are heartfelt well-formulated thoughtful and compelling .
many of them are as well — in my opinion — of real public interest and utility .
people are relating experiences and thoughts that could be genuinely helpful to others facing the same situations or wrestling with the same problems .
for this reason as of may 2018 a public forum for posting letters and receiving comments has been established at the subreddit .
if you use the straightforward form at that web address to submit your letter then other people can benefit from your thoughts and you from their responses and votes .
i will be checking the site regularly and will respond when i have the time and opportunity .
please remember rule 2 keep submissions and comments civil .

this kind of gatekeeping '' might seem distasteful but if you do n't do it the above-mentioned posers will make their own version of gatekeeping once they have enough power styling themselves as inclusive while being extremely intolerant and against artistic diversity/freedom .
gaming and really every community these people corrupt were pretty open to all kinds of people from the start all things considered .

i was trying to do the whole birthday song but nobody chimed in .
my quarterback is the best head coach i 've ever worked for .
we have to also remember that this will not follow norse mythology 100 in the same way they did n't follow greek mythology 100 .
i still think they will use it as a skeleton for basic ideas and events but the kratos and boi factor are strong .
i mean magni and modi are survivors of ragnarok in the actual mythology .
that magni and modi thing is the first divide from the mythology second is in norse mythology loki kills baldur by giving hod the blind god a mistletoe spear because the gods loved to throw stuff at baldur flouting his invincibility .
so hod threw the spear that damaged and killed baldur .
in the game baldur punches loki with the mistletoe strap and he becomes vulnerable .
he does n't die until he confronts freya and kratos is like nah bro i 've been down this path .
makes me wonder if maybe they will use kratos as a hod like character and potentially have kratos kind of take his place in the mythology .
one of the æsir is named hödr he is blind .
he is of sufficient strength but the gods would desire that no occasion should rise of naming this god for the work of his hands shall long be held in memory among gods and men .
i take this as something that could apply to kratos .
he is blind to the mythology and knows not what he does by doing it .
he is of sufficient strength as well and zues desired to not really give kratos a place among the gods .
did n't even recognize him as the legitimate god of war and instead tricked him to drain his powers .
and then the last part the work of his hands shall long be held in memory among gods and men '' come on !
he destroyed all of greece basically by slaying his entire pantheon .
mimir has heard of the ghost of sparta before kratos mentions what he is .
meaning gods over there know of him as well .
hod is the god of winter and warriors and is often depicted with his bow and arrows .
i mean i am trying to fit together awkward puzzle pieces because i have no info but there are several things i think might happened based on loose basis to the mythology and using the in game lore to try to see the differences between what the game says and what the actual lore is .
because if i can pick our differences we might be able to get some theories as to how kratos and boi change those original events .
i 'd love to hear some theories by others as well .
i was disappointed to learn after joining this sub that there was n't a pinned megathread about theories .
i like the dusted alligator vs. komodo fight card for sure .

i was wondering if you had any ideas on what i should do or if the normal dental ones worked fine and just a one time thing .

i looked into a few of your points and i do n't really understand how they are points .
a research seminar on ‘schools and gender diversity ' due to take place at edinburgh university on 11 december was cancelled technically ‘postponed ' after the university 's staff pride network complained that some of the speakers were ‘transphobic ' .
so a talk on gender diversity was cancelled because one or more of the speakers are transphobic ?
over 400 students signed a petition demanding that emeritus professor finnis 77 be removed from his teaching at the university of oxford because of his presentation of the religious view of homosexuality in a 1994 academic paper .
this is a lie finnis taught homophobic theories up until his removal .
more than 300 staff students and alumni of the university of cambridge called for an event featuring the political party justice for men and boys j4mb scheduled for 24 may to be cancelled they said that the group was anti-feminist and did not reflect the values of the university .
j4mb is pretty much a hate group they literally the party issues awards for lying feminist of the month '' to female journalists '' toxic feminist of the month '' and whiny feminist of the month '' its website includes a link to an article entitled '13 reasons women lie about being raped ' can you see why a university would n't want anything to do with this party ?
i ca n't be bothered going through the rest of your points .

and dumbarse 's like this wonder why they end up on the end of people giving them a hiding ?
they wiped out people with a strong sense of honor morality and dedication to their fellow man .
they essentially chose traitors and criminals who 're morally compromised selfish and willing to sell out their own species for wealth power and survival .
similar to how the nazi 's approached certain cowardly people who were more concerned with their survival than the good of the world .
ultimately when the nazi 's no longer needed them they met a similar fate to those they betrayed .
i have a feeling that 's how it would have ended for the people who chose the raps .
in the end the demi 's were getting crushed so i 'd be pretty worried if i chose their side at that point .
xbox supports freesync over hdmi so yes it will work .
however not all xbox one games work with vrr variable refresh rate the range on the monitor is 40-60hz so only select 60fps games will work with it .
as for hdr that is hard to say technically speaking only freesync premium pro the highest of the 3 freesync tires are certified to work with hdr/vrr at same time but lower tier monitors can work too .
the asus vg289q is the basic freesync tier no idea if it works with hdr and vrr at the same time if not then for games that support hdr vrr will be disabled in favor of hdr .
the vg289q is not a real hdr display it is n't even vesa display hdr 400 class the bare minimum of hdr levels for pc monitors .
for passable hdr you want vesa hdr 600 class minimum .

this is super odd uncalled for and just flat out wrong .
i watch his stream everyday and have for a few years i really do n't notice a difference in his attitude tbh .
he has always given his opinion good or bad about stuff and does n't hold back .
kg has done sponsored streams with ubisoft including r6 for a super long time like back to year 2 so that does n't hold up .
if its about the packs he has constantly said he does n't care if they make a 1,000,000 cosmetic as long as its not pay to win .
he has a yt video as far back as outbreak on the topic/packs so definitely not recent opinion change .
this to me kinda reeks of jealousy pengu is burnt out he needs to admit that take a break from the game .
i think he is jealous that kg still likes streaming and playing the game and does really well with the business side of streaming .
you can tell when someone does n't want to be there definitely see it with pengu i never get that feeling with kg .
he has always had some hate toward kg not sure what it is .
kg seems to always speak very positively of pengu and g2 .
ex this guy is level 70 has better stats then pengu one of the best players in the world . ''

also with nvidia 's onboard stream encoder the 2070s would give him a lot more options for streaming without overtaxing his cpu .

if people run cancel bots you can bring a rupt signet like leechsig and cancelcast it whenever he 's casting a skill .
i 've trolled some cancel bots into faking their skills like 10 times in a row .
unfortunately some are smart enough to adjust their bot and take out leechsig or whatever skill you are using out of their code .
for interrupt bots there 's not too much you can do .
the best thing is to play a bar that does n't get affected much by interrupts like blood necro .
however you usually ca n't pull off a monk bar with only 1/4 skills and if you decide to run smth like pet ranger it just means that the bot focuses on your teammates .

there doesnt seem to be a lot of good information about proper surface agitation that i can find so i figured id just ask you guys for personal experience .
when my lily pipe is below the water theres almost no surface agitation but if i have it slightly above the water there seems to be plenty .
right now i have dwarf hairgrass 2 medium bucephalandra and a ball of guppy grass until i order some more plants .
i figure because the guppy grass grows so quickly it helps take ammonia and nitrates out of my water so ill keep it until i have more plants .
do you recomend having it above for more agitation ?
edit i also have a surface skimmer which i heard helps reduce surface film and increases gas exchange .
my filter probably turns over my tank water about 9x per hour even though flow doesnt seem to be incredibly high but i also find my filter works better when the lily pipe is below water because it stirs up the stuff that settles on the bottom more .

steam offers refunds to anyone who purchases a game on its storefront provided that the customer has played less than 2 hours of the game and it has been less than fourteen 14 days since the game was either purchased or published whichever occurs later .
this enables gamers to have recourse against con artists who use misleading screenshots trailers and descriptions to sell games while still keeping the window of opportunity sufficiently narrow to prevent people from essentially getting free games '' by completing the games and then refunding them .
some game publishers want to include content in their games such as microtransactions that they know full well will cause many customers to not buy the game if they know the content is in it .
because the window of opportunity to get a refund on steam is so narrow many corporations will release the game initially without the offensive content wait only two weeks so that those who pre-ordered the game as well as those who bought the game on release day collectively amounting to a majority of the game 's sales can no longer get a refund before slipping the offensive content in .
activision blizzard is one of the most notorious practitioners of this business practice whereby they add microtransactions and loot boxes into their games after people who would not have bought the game if they knew about the microtransactions had already bought it .
the most recent egregious offender of this business practice is bethesda softworks the publisher of the critically and commercially acclaimed game doom eternal . ''
just slightly over two weeks after release the game was updated to include denuvo anti-cheat some computer software that on its face purports to prevent cheating in multiplayer competition .
despite its official purpose however the software is notorious in the pc gaming community because it a has administrator privileges to your computer giving it the ability to do whatever it wants and b is notoriously easy for cyber criminals to hack into using back doors .
for these reasons denuvo anti-cheat is considered de facto spyware '' by many consumers and for that reason many consumers would not have purchased this game if they had known that denuvo anti-cheat was going to be in it .
a quick easy and simple expedient to this problem would be for valve to update its refund policy .
under this new policy whenever a game publisher releases a newer version of the game customers now have a renewed two hours of playtime and 14 days of real time to seek a refund .
this new policy would produce a much-needed chilling effect against unscrupulous video game publishers who attempt to circumvent steam 's refund policy by baiting and switching their customers .
early access games could be an exception to this new policy since being updated is the whole point of that brand of games and buyers already enter into that purchase agreement with some inherent assumption of risk anyway .
to prevent customers from abusing this refund policy to get a refund for the game after they have completed it simply by waiting for the next regular update valve could require purchasers to specify what about this new update makes them want to refund the game .
if buyers repeatedly reference content in the games ' updates that do not appear to be offensive or justifying a refund such as the inclusion of an unfavorable daily challenge to the game then valve could read between the lines and refuse to honor the buyer 's refund request and potentially even lock them out of future refund requests if they continue to abuse the refund policy .
if a large number of people in a short amount of time request refunds for the same reason such as denuvo it is most likely not abuse .
to encourage valve corporation to adopt this new refund policy i have started a petition on change.org https change.org .
you can find the petition here http chng.it/rrwwsfqc http chng.it/rrwwsfqc
i ask that you all sign the petition and also assist me in circulating the petition to ensure as many people as possible see it .
i will submit the petition to valve corporation if i can get one hundred thousand signatures on it .
it 's two hours of just standing and wasting time .
i ca n't say no to doing it either .
is there anything i can do to entertain myself during this time ?
showing my age here but i 've dabbled in various counting systems for almost 20 years .
never took it too serious because life happened and kids and family took priority over going to vegas 3-4 times a year .
now i 've come full circle and want to finally learn a system completely .
i have no intention of playing blackjack for a living but would love to supplement other investments and income streams and just enjoy a trip or two a year with a fighting chance .
i love the math behind counting and devour any information i can find on the subject .
just curious to know if the knock out bj system ever became popular or is it still used .
i still plan on sticking to hi lo but always wondered about balanced counts .
im 3 hours from being on t for one week .

i left my game and was sure to save the edits made to my base meaning i went into my ship and left to autosave .
the only thing that stayed were the terminals i moved .
i did n't connect power to the building before i left .
how can i prevent this from happening in the future ?
even though i did n't lose a ton of progress it was still disheartening to see the resources i used disappear into thin air .
i 'm lapys i 'm looking for some people to play the new terraria mastermode with or to try out the calamity mod !
i also recently got stardew valley and i was hoping i could try it out for the first time with some company !
i love meeting new people specially over things we love .
hi everyone i 'm new to this sub and i would love to talk with you guys .
i recently opened up to my best friend i did n't like lying to her about what would randomly shift my mood in random moments throughout the day .
when i told them finally they were relieved knowing that they were n't crazy .
just last week i asked them how often do you dream at night ?
they said that they dream fairly often and i was a bit surprised .
i have a handful dreams that i can vividly remember .
from the handful since i was little most of them have been nightmares .
and a few weird dreams that were super realistic taste smell .
is it ok if half of my male coworkers fucked me when we were all drunk ?
hiii ive been having trouble selling anything for about 3 weeks straight and its upsetting .
i have interesting items and ive dropped the prices a lot and even dropped shipping .
i think my page may look messy because i dont have a set background .
could someone lead me in the right direction to help me make another sell soon ?
i use hashtags and dont use random words for exposure and those things .
so i guess marco polo season 3 is not happening while 50 of new shows netflix is putting money in are literally unwatchable .

i 've dipped in and out of self improvement practices for the last few years but recently i 've been going through some stuff and hit my breaking point and have decided to get back into sorting myself out and not trying to find comfort in someone else .
it 's a bit frustrating because of the situation of the world it seems like i ca n't do this fully e.g .
join a sports club or gym so i feel a bit limited in some ways .
personally this is what i 'm trying to do to be the best version of myself .
i 've struggled my whole life with anxiety and as a teenager now 19 i 've had several bouts of depression recurrent panic/anxiety attacks obsessive thoughts pertaining to relationships when things go wrong and mood swings/splitting on people over little things .
i 've noticed that depending on what i 've eaten i get worse anxiety .
i want to greatly reduce my sugar intake and keep it to sugars found in fruit if any .
i want to eat clean just meat and vegetables especially leafy greens and colorful veg to get more nutrients .
i think i am probably deficient in a lot and i get little sunlight .
i 've never put effort into my appearance but recently i 've been trying sheer and natural makeup to make me look a bit healthier .
i 've got some nice toiletries to make washing more enjoyable as being depressed has made it a chore .
i have spent a bit of money on clothes that fit well .
when i have spent time on looking better i 've felt more confident and the confidence rubs off into my interactions with others and i feel like the funny/intelligent person i am inside but others do n't always see .
i have been building and painting model aircraft as i love the military and history .
i think it would be good to have a new skill modelmaking and i have to concentrate on the gluing and painting i 'm sure this helps take my mind off of the bad stuff and stops me ruminating .
i would like to be more hands-on so i 've thought about building my own mechanical keyboard as it involves soldering and once i have a nice keyboard i think it would encourage me to use it more and self study which is something i enjoy as a studious person .
i love reading and being knowledgeable in a variety of areas .
this includes science/space history true crime self-help psychology philosophy and medical stuff .
i have spent a lot of time on open learn and future learn doing online short courses in science and medicine as i want to be a doctor .
i 'd like to get more involved in either an internship/work experience/voluntary sense in a few societies medical scientific charities this will probably be hard to arrange but it 's worth a try .
the book on my bedside table is the tao of pooh .
i like to physically hold the book and turn the pages so i make an effort to be reading a paper book as well as audiobooks .
i 've been filling out the daily stoic journal by ryan holiday and i enjoy the thought provoking questions i have to answer everyday .
i also have a day a page diary that i use as a gratitude journal to identify the positives of my daily life .
i have a bullet journal as well which i use to make more permanent notes on things like career goals or a routine .
i have a cheaper notebook from my dad that i use to make shopping lists plan things i want to do in future etc .
i have a cheap pad for my daily to do list to make sure i follow my morning routine i find having something physical to cross off helps me actually do it .
i 've been sticking to my morning routine to start my day off right .
i wake up and have a hot drink i 've been intending of drinking more tea and have some on the way but a few days i 've had a nice aeropress coffee to wake me up .
i want to limit coffee especially on work days when i 'll get triggered .
then i 'll dance around to some music which is something i 've been doing for years to escape a little bit .
i 'll try to sit and meditate for 5-10 minutes but if i 'm in a rush i 'll use one of headspace 's walking meditations for my walk to work .
i have a free subscription to headspace through work currently so it does n't hurt to use .
i do a morning mobility routine by tom merrick on youtube which is some pike squats/rotations cat stretch table pose neck stretches just to loosen me up a bit and get moving in the morning .
i 'll listen to an audiobook on the way to work i listen to either the alchemist by paulo coelho or the subtle art of not giving a fuck both i 'm enjoying .
cold showers as i 've heard they release endorphins i 've felt better after them before but ca n't bring myself to do it .
i 've got a punch bag but nowhere to hang it .
i might ask my dad if i can sort the shed out and turn it into a gym .
i 'd like to start weightlifting as i enjoy solo sports more than team ones and i 've used dumbbells in the past and felt better afterwards .
i 've got football stuff but not got access to a goal to practice with .
i get anxious about going on runs but i 've been once so far and quite liked it .
i want to try a martial art and bjj appeals to me for some reason .
ca n't do this yet due to lockdown restrictions though .
i have a few other hobbies in mind that if like to get into .
i ca n't get a dog anymore as no one is in the house during the day due to work so i thought i could get into having aquariums or paludariums .
they 've beautiful to look at and add some nature to a room .
i 've also heard there 's some science behind feeling calmer when watching fish like moving your eyes without moving your head relaxes you or something .
i find ants very fascinating creatures and have been watching a lot of videos on them lately i think an ant farm would be cool and a niche area to learn about .
i would like to grow my own vegetables on my windowsill then i can use these in my cooking which is another thing i enjoy doing .
i 'm a spice lover so maybe some chilli varieties too .
in terms of sports i have been wanted to cycle for a while .
again this is something i have a lot of anxiety about because i would have to leave the house to do so either riding on the road or mountain biking .
i know it seems like i 've got a lot of plans for myself maybe even too many .
but some are things i would have going on in the background and do a couple of times a week e.g .
growing veg and cycling at the weekends to get out for a bit .
i am such an on-the-go person so keeping busy keeps me happy .
i have not been able to do so many things due to my anxiety and i would love to be able to try them .
serious eats is my go-to site for recipe browsing .
they do a lot of decadent delicious comfort food so i was so surprised to stumble across this https www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/light-and-easy-five-minute-fruit-mousse-dessert-recipe.html recipe for a quick fruit mousse .
i was skeptical when i really read the ingredient list but holy crap it was a huge success .
i halved the recipe as written so it came out to 4oz frozen peaches 57 cal 1t sugar 48 cal and half an egg white 9 cal for a total of about 115 calories .
it whipped up in just about one minute in my mini food processor .
i ate it immediately so it was still cold and had the fluffy texture of mousse .
next time i 'll add a little citrus to perk it up a bit but it was delicious and i 'll absolutely make it again !
what is the power that the amplifier would need provide to the load rl if i inject a input signal vin in the form of a sine with 1khz frequency and 1mv amplitude ?
i know that the power provided to that load can be computed using
v0rms 2 rl v0m 2 2rl being v0m the amplitude of the output signal also a sine .
lets say the total output of the amplifier 3 stages is 130 so i multiply v0m with 130 and put that value on the equation above ?
also to find the maximum power that the amplifier can provide to that load without occurring distortion i will need to take into account vcc and vee right ?
lets say vcc 5v and vee 5v the maximum amplitude for the output signal will be 5v=vcc ?
now this op-amp with negative feedback https imgur.com/a/3svgw4v is said to have a gain of 10 .
i need to choose the dimensions of r1 and r2 to make it right .
here 's my attempt https imgur.com/a/g45poik i already have the values for ad .
i need to choose the values for r1 and r2 wisely i think .
what i dont understand is what is the point of having r3 in there ?
and what would the value for r3 has to be taking into regard what i said about r1 r2 and the gain .
it is said to be r2//r1 but i dont know why .
and to compute the input impedance of that circuit op-amp with negative feedback what should i do ?
last question i need to find the current source if1 output impedance https imgur.com/a/2jvzycd .
i believe i need to do the small signal and try to obtain it from there ?
honestly i still did n't try this and going to give this a chance tomorrow ...
i am looking to buy a new mac which i will use ableton live 10 suite .
i was wondering if anyone can give me any tips as to what macbook pro to buy .
i am currently looking at the macbook pro 16in that has i7/16gb ram/512gb ssd or if i should go for the 2020 macbook pro 13 inch which has the i5 10th gen/16gb ram and 1tb ssd and save myself a couple of hundredth bucks ?
is 512gb enough storage and use an external ssd for samples/tracks or have everything on the internal storage and buy a macbook with 1tb ssd ?
and is the 10th gen i5 processor powerful enough for music production softwares ?

i work for a company that wanted to upgrade our ecommerce platform from opencart to magento because of all the community support for the platform .
because none of us had much experience with magento we hired a local company to setup the new magento website for us .
after about 3 months we got the site and everything looked good so we imported our product and category structure which has around 30k products and around 200 attributes and about 50 categories .
after this import the site crawled to a stop .
category pages take 40 seconds to load and product pages can take up to 120 seconds .
we went back to the developers which told us we just needed to put the site in production mode and turn on varnish cache .
with those changes a cached page will load just fine however with so many products and such long load times it seems impossible to keep the whole site cached without overloading my server with page requests .
our original developers are completely unwilling to help us with this problem and we have hired 2 other magento 2 experts '' who were able to make some progress but have come to the conclusion that only a complete rewrite of the theme will get us to where we want to be .
i guess posting here is just a kind of last ditch effort to see if anyone knows of somewhere i can go for help with this problem .
i have already tried everything that is suggested in probably every magento 2 speed optimization blog i could find .
i have tried flat product tables redis cache memcache among many other site configuration changes to try and optimize the speed .
also i am on a computer with 16 gigs of ram and 500 gig ssd with 8 cores .
sorry for the long post and thank you for any suggestions .
sometimes i just feel like i 'm completely worthless and so utterly tired .
i feel like no one cares about me and it 's hard to get out of bed .
i ca n't do anything like i have school work to do so i can actually finish my school year and i just ca n't get myself do to it .
like even things i really want to do like i really want to finish my book and i do n't have that much left but i just ca n't get myself to do it and it drives me insane .
i 'm just so tired i wish i was actually competent .
i just finished the all stars cycle and wondering if they had any other models in mind that declined .
i heard jade was one but was n't sure if there was more !
i remember playing this card turnbased strategy game around 2005 .
it was a demo and i did not have the full version .
the full version had fire mage deck and other elemental decks .
i have tried to recollect its name for years .
you had a deck and you play against cpu .
please someone tell me which service is best pihole or adguard ?
so i stopped playing for a bit after shadowkeep just got busy .
now with quarantining i 'm picking the game back up again .
is it worth it to go through all the steps and grind to get the chalice from season of opulance completed or should i just move on ?
the most complete list i saw online updated every day very professional source such a data trove .
as a community let 's do some dd together enjoy guys .
• what the inside of day court looks like .
• thesan 's lovers name and more about their relationship .
• speaking of names i would really like to know the rest of lucien 's asshole brothers names and his mothers name .
• i would also like to know what rhysand 's mother and sister were named .
• just more about all the high lords in general that we did n't really get to know through feyre 's perspective .
• mr. archerons epic adventure through prythian and what happened during the time he was away .
•things that tamlin and rhysand would speak about/do together when they were friends .
• why the hell cassian destroyed a building in summer court .
i have n't been sleeping much and i 'm exhausted so i 'll start it short .
i 've found myself having more of what i started referring to as freakouts '' on people since realizing i may have bpd .
i contact them more incessantly i accuse them of things that i 'm only suspicious about i want them to acknowledge me more etc .
in this last week i 've been more emotional than ever before in my life .
i have n't been getting the support i expected and i do n't even know where to start as far as finding a therapist .
if this behavior continues after learning i have bpd i 'm not really optimistic about how i 'll cope with it going forward .
i 've lost 15 pounds in the last week .
i 'm 5'11 '' and only weighed around 140 .
this last week i have n't had an appetite .
it took me 3 days to finish eating a medium pizza .
i have no idea what 's going on with me .
i am so sad it is tiring and i ca n't hide it anymore .
i try so hard to open up to the people i trust and care about but they give me nothing back which ends up making me feel embarrassed and like my emotions/feelings do n't matter .
i wish the people who claim they love me started acting like they love me more .
i used to cry everyday because i felt like i had no friends or no one to talk to .
now i do n't want to talk to anyone because they just end up hurting me and turning me down at the end .
nobody can understand what i am going through and i wish they would just stop for a minute and try to understand rather than just completely ignoring me .
i am sick of answers like that sucks or i am sorry i need more .
i have my brake with load cell close to where i want it .
but i 'd like to slightly increase the pressure needed to reach maximum braking .
but i do n't want to have to use the wizard because it difficult to reproduce the exact amount of brake pressure each time .
so i end up setting resetting resetting resetting ad nauseum .
is there somewhere in the config file or elsewhere where i can simply increase the amount of brake pressure ?
with everything going on all the restrictions and limited access to the parish i did n't think i 'd be able to get through .
it was n't an emergency though it felt like it to me and the parish was closed for the night .
our parochial vicar responded to my email in five minutes .
he met with me in the courtyard of the parish within the hour and gave me spiritual direction .
i thanked him profusely for making the time and he said he was happy he could that this was the kind of thing he signed up for .
as we were finishing up he looked at his phone and said it was good i kept him late .
he had just gotten another email from someone asking to meet tonight .
i 'm still a little emotional and so thankful that god has sent us these men who make themselves available for broken sinners like me .
yeah but these two people have been beefing with each other for quite a while yet he has more monthly listeners .
people need to get theirs looks at the white house
they have basic information on events rules bugs standard stuff you would expect a volunteer to know .
hell i 'd even go so far as to say they are closer to volunteer janitors since the majority if their job is dealing with bots chat violations and people stuck in bugs .

in a game with most groups being 3-5 people out of position '' is far more common than say warhammer since everyone is a hero no matter how much they work together .
expecting 2-3 people to form a front line with flankers close on the sides and ranged characters in back every combat is unrealistic .
i understand i 'm grossing simplifying things but penalties for regular occurrences advantage from flanking is unfun at best .
if the situation calls for it the dm can simply impose advantage as they see fit without the hard fast flanking rule .

i looked at some of the summaries and reviews about it on amazon and it looks like a great resource .
i wish that my spouse or i found that before but it looks to have helpful information .
that was a claim that was made by some ward members that were close to her that i was physically abusive .
while i suspect nobody on here knows who i am i have no reason to not be open .
i believe the experiences for abuse are different for the person committing them and the victim .
i do n't think anything i did qualified but she seems to think so .
or she had already made up her mind that she wanted to leave and said vague things to ward members like i do n't feel safe i want to leave to explain how she felt .
i completely agree that marital counseling would be a bad idea for a couple experiencing physical abuse .
it can be a frustrating and difficult thing to go through and it could make the abuser lash out .
the part i do n't understand is if my friend was being abused i would get him/her out of there and call the cops .
she was telling people these things for months all the while we were living together and i was working on the relationship .
these are just some questions i have if people actually believed abuse was going on why was she living with me so long while we went to therapy and why were n't actual authorities involved ?
if i was actually abusive would she have told me directly like she did that she wanted to separate for a couple days and asked me to leave the apartment for a little while for a friend to come over and help her pack her things ?
would somebody abusive have just stepped to the side after being devastated by that ?
then two weeks later she told me she filed for divorce and asked me to leave the apartment again so she and ward members could help her collect her things .
and i just got out of there did n't want to create any conflict .
i just do n't think that behavior lines up with the abuser/abused dynamic .
the last thing that bothers me is i have a relationship with most of the ward members involved .
they have to realize they were only approached by one side and only talked to one side .
if they believed she was being abused why would n't they get her to safety and then come get my side on what happened ?
maybe i 'm a bad friend but i feel like i would be asking for the proof before betraying a friend like that especially if it 's just he said/she said .
then i would get the real authorities involved to help her get out because that 's the only way to take her to safety .
or at least come to the abuser afterward and ask for their side instead of just turning your back on them and propagating rumors throughout the ward .
i understand what you mean when you say my actions could have been interpreted that way .
my intentions were to help us work on our marital friendship which yeah could lead to sex but more importantly it would help draw us closer .
there was a void building and i was trying to close the gap .
also the intention of doing some of the things i did was to take things off of her shoulders so that we could just spend some time together .

man i 'm just asking to get downvoted by putting that trip together but the point is that these games had absolutely shit launches and will never live that down but ... patches and updates exist .
they should have coulda have would have been polished from the start but ... deadlines i guess .
but now ... they look great play great plenty of content .
stories are n't quite top notch for their franchise but still miles above most of the other stuff that gets praised by the internet .
i really went out on a limb buying these games but the fact of the matter is i wanted to formulate my own opinion not base it off of internet strangers .
and i grew to love these games just as much as their previous entries .
and that 's okay other people do n't have to like it for me to like something and i 'm okay with that .

to put it another way amazon generic lights are like harbor freight this is like napa and surefire is snap-on .

buttons and switches usually fail first on cheap flashlights .
sometimes they use the exact same led sometimes they take a cheap one and overdrive it cutting its life by 80 in the process .
light pattern is going to be much more even on this with no weird bright or dark spots where you are aiming .
light color is going to be richer as well .
this helps you to more quickly identify what you are aiming at .
these things get hot so they have to be able to handle and dissipate heat well .
that means better capacitors better fit of components and more metal in the right places to conduct the heat away .
better driver circuit will put less stress on the led can dim it to prevent overheating and will have japanese made capacitors instead of cheap chinesium .
when your household lamp led bulbs burn out its usually not the led itself that burned out but the cheap driver circuit that got cooked to death .
drop it smack it into a wall it keeps working .
in all fairness there is nothing wrong with a cheap flashlight in that its of a lot better than no flashlight .
like all things that you rely on test out what you have and see if it works for you .
remember you do n't want it to fail at a bad time .
it might be adequate for your particular needs or you might want to keep it for everyday stuff and upgrade what you put on your rifle .
there is that joke that a flashlight is nothing more than a container for holding dead batteries .
its good for a laugh when you need something out of the shed and all you have to do is go find another light or fresh batteries not so much when you hear a thump in the night and the light switch is at the wrong end of the house .
based on everything they 've done so far i would expect some online missions conquest missions exchange missions moments .
there are way more characters in ozark then there were in breaking bad .
feels that way anyway off the top of my head .
that makes it more similar to the sopranos imo .
breaking bad did a good job of really just focusing on two characters the entire time .
everyone else was just kind of on the side to help explain the story .
ozark feels like it has a much deeper bench of characters .
each show is great in their own right but it 's hard to compare them .
ozark moves at a much faster pace than breaking bad .
some might not like the fast pace but with all the characters getting a lot of air time it needs to move fast .
one example is when marty had his toenails torn off by the cartel .
breaking bad would have spent five minutes shortly after showing walter applying self first aide to the wound and cutting the tops off of his shows or something .
nothing on the hotend should change in response to an extruder move command .

we will always need humans to edit what the computer comes up with .
even the best computer program could n't understand the nuance of context .
for an example grab the best or any free translation software you can and play a game .
you 'll get a lot of nonsense in the translation window .
mostly because it 's a poorly done literal translation .
but even if you take out the poorly done part it will still just be literal .
we might be missing words from that language it might take a lot of different ideas to express what was said .
and it even might be up to personal interpretation which a computer could n't give look at the debacle with new evangelion subs even and you 'll see humans ca n't always do it .

this is a 16x16x16 isometric building working in a limited blank space is very inspiring
i took a pic of every stage of contruction and it became a cool gif i want to make more of these soon
to put you in cotext a while ago i made a building i called the apple school each professor with it 's unique abilities and knowledge miss magnolia is the botanic magic professor and inspired this farm shop
miss magnolia lives here with her frightbulb friend called bud
the interior might not be the best but is has a bedroom in the second floor and the shop in the first humble and comfy for them
the farm fields is where she spends the most after school always with bud at her side
some students practice in her fields bringing to life pumpkins growing tomatoes instantly or making seeds fly and bloom in the sky
even when all seems to be perfect for them a dreamed green peaceful farm life for now earnings from the farm shop are little .
i 'm sure luck might change for them if they become permanent residents of acorn town and learn from the legacy of furrowfield .
all of the buldings of this kind will be part of something i like to call the isometric museum a collection of buildings available to explore inspire blueprint and more if you want to watch a small video about it here is the link

when it comes to anal what helped us was this .
during reverse cowgirl i would squeeze and massage her butt cheeks and gradually move my hands towards the center and around her anus .
eventually i would place my thumb on her anus but not inside .
soon enough she pushed back onto my thumb and i left it there while reverse cowgirl .
we talked about how she liked the thumb and brought up anal .
it 's not the in and out motion it 's the pressure .
she gets some of the strongest orgasms from anal .
when we first started intentionally using my thumb for penetration i 'd wear a latex glove to avoid contaminating my fingers plus she 's self conscious about it .
she got comfortable to where that did n't matter anymore .
i 'm thinking about going full rostami and training without socks .

the way i see it is the noxious ideal has a lot of value and potential .

add in the fact that darius and swain are probably the best leaders the nation has ever had the current noxious is def comparable to the other notions especially internationally .
finally especially in recent years people tend to care more about social or emotional problems plus it 's a fantasy world so the idea of war and death has less of an impact as it normally would .

your scary '' examples are only at a 60-70 point to me and i see them on a different axis let me explain .
mutate is pretty easy rules wise where i would put it under 50 for complexity .
the issue is in the handling putting it in the ball park of transform morh flip cards and other mechanics that require some manual manipulation to get the effect or figure out what the card does .
in that way i would say counters put on permanents are on the low end and flipping cards is on the top end chaos orb with mutate somewhere at the level of those annoying cards from innistrad you need to have to halves of to make them work the name escapes me right now
i used the college panda writing workbook and steve warner 's book for sat math .
for reading i did n't use any books but used a strategy very similar to the one showed in this video
you should take a practice test before starting these books then finish these books and take as many practice tests as you can .
i took one practice test every two days for the 2 weeks leading up to the sat i split it up by section i never took a full test in one go in my practice .
the final night before the test look through all your practice tests and find each mistake redo the problem learn why the answer is right and why you made the error .
i am not from the us but what i like about your country is that distrusting the government seems to be a trait that most people embody .
that 's a good trait to have sure sometimes it can get overboard like the corona retards but generally its a political virtue that most demographics lack .
so its quite surprising that america has never seen solid socialist movement .
that 's scary but it also means that the first movement to really tap into that popular furry will have a tremendous opportunity to transform the national conversation fast .
i really do hope that us politics is invaded by good socialist policies especially foreign policy .
but for now the state of political discourse in your country seems to have been dismantled by the radlibs or right wing edgelords .
but yes i am hopeful that if not a revolution then atleast a new wave of leftist radicals who will bring the attention back to class is imminent .
when considering telling people about being asexual it 's definitely worth accounting for the overall cultural beliefs about lgbt groups .
if you live in a country where alternative sexualities are demonised then it may be beneficial to avoid coming out in order to ensure your safety and wellbeing are maintained .
your families ' assumptions sound common but not necessarily as though they 'd be hostile towards asexuality .
i live in the uk and told my parents that i 'm ace their reaction was incredibly positive and they supported me happy i know what i 'm feeling .
however i acknowledge that this response is quite rare as many parents are completely unaware of what asexuality actually is .
i understand the factors which are discouraging you from coming out i hope you 're able to in the future if your circumstances change
thank you all for your help i only need 500k more currency 😂

disclaimer i am a married dude so if that 's not your cup of tea thats understandable .
i have no idea what the reward maps you get from battles do
all games are based on how the brain works when it comes to learning and being rewarded which causes getting addicted .
at first you are presented with how the game works and are being given an appropriate challenge in fortnite this could be playing in a bot lobby or other new players .
as you overcome this challenge you are being rewarded '' in such a way that your brain sends out feel good hormones '' .
this is the essence of all video games and is the reason for why most people play video games from a brain chemical point of view that is .
however over time you 'll get used to the feeling and will no longer be satisfied unless the challenge is getting harder and thus causing the effect of the reward to be stronger .
in fortnite this could manifest itself in playing and winning over much better players than yourself .
however as you are getting better and the game gets harder you will reach a point where being rewarded '' becomes difficult and extremely rare .
you 'll have to spend a lot more time to win .
by constantly grinding and not winning you 'll be frustrated and demotivated .

hi everyone i 'm 34 and had one ivf round .
9 eggs retrieved,7 mature 4 embryos at the end .
first one took everything looked fine we were so happy !
i ca n't sleep i imagine my life without a child .
we have 3 embryos left but we did n't test them and now i 'm so so scared each and every one of them has chromosomal abnormalities or some kind of a problem .
i do n't know but i do n't want to defreeze them to test and then freeze them again .
i think i would test before freezing if we try another ivf round .
has anyone had a full term pregnancy from after a failed fet but from the same retrieval embryos ?
thank you so much for your answers i know everyone is different but i 'd love to share with you .

your teammate or others can teach you about recoil patterns checking corners and a lot of great fundamentals for the game .
also it would be fun to have a little competition between friends to see who has the best spray pattern aim and etc .

i 've noticed that a lot of times in his conlang showcases biblaridion demonstrates vocabulary that seems to be for a bunch of ancient creatures such as armor fish '' or titanotheres . ''
are his languages set in a world where these creatures run amok ?
also as an aside where can i view full documentations of his languages ?
so if you have n't read my last post basically my ex m18 got mad at me f 16 for no reason .
he then goes and post a tik tok saying if i wan na get on his bad side he can ruin my life. he called me a h*e and keeps posting things about me .
i ended up blocking him on insta tik tok and snap but it 's like he just really is angry about something .
i 'm kinda in low spirits right now and i could really use some advice .
i listen to smooth on the radio on the way in to work and there 's several voiced advertisements per block talking about construction being the backbone of australian economy and tradies being the real aussie battlers and the whole thing is vaguely over the top .
i 'm not saying we should n't celebrate anyone working hard during this time but these ads are so bizarre to me .
i came across this site through the mindless self indulgence band reddit .
anyway here is a mix of two pumpkins songs as one .

what other mixes might work out for a medley type song ?
hey guys first off hope everyone is doing well given current events .
i was hoping to get different perspectives from people who have been in the 4+1 program or regular grad programs .
i 'm trying to decide which is right for me .
i am a com major so i would be applying for the communication studies program .
when i walked up it swelled up and changed color from grey/black to grey/brown .
i got engaged recently and my finance and i decided during quarantine we will begin some of the planning .
when we told our families they were really happy .
my fiance asked my older brother to be his best man as my fiance was my brothers best man at his wedding .
they have been best friends for a long time .
my fiance asked my brother to be his best man on a video chat with him and his wife my sil .
my brother was very happy but my sil got very quiet when we changed the subject .
she didnt say much for the rest of the call .
i asked my younger sister to be my maid of honor .
she was ecstatic and with my premission posted her excitement on social media .
she congratulated me and said how she was excited to be my maid of honor promising to do her best .
my sil left a comment saying she should n't brag about being the moh and how there were people who deserved it more than she did .
she calls me an ah for not asking her to be my moh .
she goes on a rant on how she feels like i dont like her and how i 'm a bully because i wont let her be my moh .
she later posted how she felt betrayed that her own family could do such a cruel thing to her .
so aita for not letting my sil be my moh ?
i 'm about to be a 2l in law school and made friends with the westlaw and lexis reps on campus and they 've asked me to apply to be a rep in the fall to take over for the graduating 3l 's .
i do n't want to be rude and ask them about pay before i apply but does anyone know the approximate amounts i 'm at an la area law school ?
if you were a rep what was the best part of the job what was the worst part of the job ?
did you have to do a task or just talk with the rep ?
if you 've graduated has being a rep helped with practice ?

i 'm a stay at home mom of a 2 year old girl .
she is independent and stubborn has been from the beginning which my husband and i foster as best as we can .
however i feel like i 'm in a constant battle with her over everything .
i 'm talking about changing her diaper brushing her teeth getting her to eat entertaining etc .
she does have a speech delay and is in therapy it 's been a godsend but she has a very hard time expressing herself and communicating .
she is a head banger when she gets overwhelmed which started when she was about 14 months old .
i feel like everyday is the same on fucking repeat .
some days i want to throw my hands up pack a bag and drive somewhere .
i love this little girl so much and it makes me feel like a pos mother when i vent like this .
thoughts prayers advice magic whatever the fuck is greatly appreciated .
i have apache plants with loads of side shoots already that i pinched the buds off but i 'm still finding new ones and the plant is n't increasing size .
should i just pinch them all off until the plant reaches height ?
it 's about half the size it should be at maturity .
also my other peppers jalas thai dragon and carolina reapers were n't producing many side shoots so i topped them all and now see the shoots coming through .
should i continue pinching any buds on those too while they 're undersized ?
shirish and farah got married in 2004 and in 2006 he bags his first directorial debutant jaaneman .
a film with big stars big producer high production value good reviews did reasonably well .
a film akshay refuses to promote and its left to shah rukh to help with the promotion .
four years later comes kriti 2016 a short web film where he gets accused of plagiarism .
fast forward 2020 and he has mrs serial killer which is worse than joker .
this man had everything going for him how many people can brag they had there kanyadaan done by srk .
before his first movie was even released he was on rendezvous with simi grewal where simi predicted that it was ‘inevitable ' that he would be a success .
karan johar needs to watch simi 's interview how to make someone squirm and be so lovely and polite .
shirish having made a short cut to fame through farah
farah having all the contacts and it being inevitable that he would be a success .
i feel like i 'm losing my mind a bit reading about all of these playoff format proposals that add more teams than the current 16 that are currently slated to play .
i think starting the nba in the us is risky already but i do n't see the point in adding more teams so we can either have play-in games a gimmicky group stage or some kind of regular season .
the potential play in games in particular are insane to me .
is it really worth it to have more players personnel and families to have a different 8th seed team ?
any proposal that introduces more variables than necessary should be a non-starter during a global pandemic .
it 's going to be hard enough to do this with 16 teams let 's not overthink it .
i do n't know if this will be possible however i feel like there could be some interesting designs for custom maps .
in the course of seven years there were a lot of emotions and then there was none .
i kept moving but i was stuck in place .
you 'd think that you 're better off on the road to self-discovery but i 'm struggling with this prolonged rude awakening .
no amount of personality tests or articles on self-worth could pacify thoughts of measuring up .
in the pursuit of meaning i lost friends left and right thinking i 'd be better off without them .
but who 's to tell what 's what and who 's who ?
at some point i knew i put a lot of faith in people but i could never manage to put enough in myself – and when my expectations were failing me i 'd fall deeper into ruin .
i used to be sure enough of what i 'm feeling that i 'd be able to put that into writing but realism is n't always a great addition to the product mix .
this is the longest i 've gone from staring at the caret ultimately leading to abandoning the writing altogether .
yes but i 'm still here – still perpetually second-guessing myself and trying to convince me that i do n't like myself and this world enough to care .
the hard part of being self-aware is that i know i need help .
maybe i 'd even have a grasp of the kind of help i need .
but if we were to start consciously breathing how shall i start systematically laying out the steps ?
did walmart jet do any projects to achieve systems/platform integration ?
any details on what they were and how they turned out ?

hi i need some help with installing something that allows me to spoof on a huawei mate 10 lite .
i´v tried disabling the google services and installing the arm64-v8a 480dpi version from here

'new-ish ' player here played the game on release now came back about a month ago and having a blast

i know that they had an issue where they gave the chapter out to everybody on the initial release however i thought that rectifying this issue was the reason for the long off-time of the server ?
now i know that the addon programmers also need to update their stuff in time and i do n't want to be impatient since all of this is free stuff .
however since i pretty much only use pretty popular addons i was wondering what time frame i should expect for things to work normally again .

hi i am thinking of taken aosc123 with jeffrey henriksen as a summer course but was wondering if it is super hard ?
i am attempting to make a small batch zine nothing fancy or anything in fact that 's kind of the aesthetic du jour .
so i can only print once because pandemic so doing a normal cut and paste situation is n't going to work as that would require two trips .
i also only have access to word on my work laptop and ca n't download anything extra though i did see gimp preprogrammed .
that 's my situation now for my question i want to format a quarter sized zine i 'm seeing templates for half size but not quarter .
doing the math on this thing is going to take as much time as putting all the content together to be honest considering just writing out each one by hand at this point .
does anyone know of any template or easy way to format or access to a resource that will help me step by step this ?
tl dr how can i easily format a quarter sized zine in word ?

i was swapping out a nest hello so i was pretty familiar with how to install these things
however i could not load the installation guide on my phone it asked for a password but i did n't know what password to put in it did not ask for a username so ?
easily rivals the nest hello and even beats it in some regards .
quality resolution bitrate framerate of recordings far exceeds any other doorbell cameras i 've seen .
i think others stream at high quality and record archive at a lower quality maybe .
the app integration is good but this is where nest clearly wins .
tapping the notification takes you directly into the app viewing the live feed of the camera in like a floating window thing and there is a button you can press to talk to the person at the door
i have my porch marked as a motion zone but ignoring the road .
it 's trash day so there were definitely opportunities for false positives here .
this thing is much better than a ring in this regard .
no preview image in the doorbell ring notification i will really miss this feature from my nest hello .
seeing who 's at the door from my apple watch was the best !
the screen is definitely cool although at this point if there was a cheaper model without it i might go for that .
does n't seem to be a must have '' feature for me yet .
you can set custom messages on it that last for a certain amount of time or indefinitely .
obviously not sending my video to the cloud is the best part .
that 's why everyone that wants one of these wants one .
it seems to me that anyone who believes that this season can resume in anything approaching a pre-covid form is not being realistic .
i understand that there are proposals to continue the season with all of the players of a certain number of teams together with what i assume would be substantial staff essentially cabined off in one location be it disneyland or otherwise .
under these proposals either there would be a limited remaining regular season or playoffs or a modified version of the playoffs would begin right away .
i think that these proposals share a common flaw even with these precautionary measures in place it seems virtually certain that individual players will come down with the virus or come into close enough contact with an infectious person that it will become necessary for them to enter a period of quarantine .
if this occurs during the playoffs which are obviously lengthy then it has the potential to dramatically undermine them in a way that ordinary injuries do not .
what happens if multiple players on a team in the finals or conference finals become ill ?
what if that happens to both teams paired head-to-head in a given round ?
while there 's a chance that things work out fine i think a much better course would be to give up on the idea of trying to go back to normal '' this season with a vaccine or substantial changes to the trajectory of the virus 's spread things should be different going forward .
but that 's not to say that professional basketball could n't continue in an exciting and interesting way .
as just one example what about a league '' administered by the nba comprised of the players on all teams at least those who are willing to participate an issue that this structuring can address while it 's hard to see how other proposals would fare where the teams change periodically ?
that way if some players do become infected we would n't be stuck trying to play incomplete rosters against other incomplete rosters .
we could re-set and still have interesting organized basketball in some form .
now this does n't have to be just a glorified scrimmage .
this could be done in ways that amplify interest over time .
just like in pickup basketball there could be rewards to success .
teams that do well during a given period could get to stay together maybe get some extra revenue in theory players who 'd rather sit out could get a smaller cut while less successful teams get broken up .
maybe there 's an element of starting with captains who get to pick their teams like for the all-star game .
i do n't know but i think there could be tons of ways to make this fun .
that 's not to say there would n't be substantial practical difficulties .
obviously the players and teams would have to go for it and i 'm sure there are innumerable technical challenges .
but there are challenges to be overcome to try to get the existing season back up and running and i just do n't think it 's going to work out in the end .
maybe i 'm wrong about that but i think alternative structures like the one i 've outlined are worth thinking about .
if anyone has similar ideas or reasons why this does n't make sense i 'd be happy to hear them .
i am looking for this sound to do meditation but i have looked all over and ca n't find it .
if anyone has this sound or background music please let me know .
i just love the sound of the low base and get bliss from it .
i was intensely emotionally overwhelmed throughout my youth possibly on the spectrum .
many of the adults and peers around me were very old-fashioned instilling a powerful stigma towards effeminacy and homosexuality .
i was also highly intimidated by the more macho and violent working class kids around me .
one of nirvana 's abilities says that 50 of his p.def will be converted into 50 c.def .
does this mean that out of the first half another half is being deduced ?
so am i reading this wrong or is this buff only 25 extra c.def ?
my wife and i were watching a show that mentioned horse drill teams drill horse teams ? .
in the show one of the horses got hurt and they had to pull it from the performance .
our question for anyone with this kind of drill team experience would you say the horses learn the choreography ?
could the rider have hopped on another horse and lead it through the performance ?
or does the horse have to have prior experience with the routine otherwise they get overwhelmed ?
i have a juvenile so i have n't purchased his adult sized terrarium yet .
when i do i really want to try my hand at going bioactive .
i 'll probably be getting an exo terra brand 18x18x24 because i prefer 2 doors on the front to the similarly sized zoo med terrarium .
that said if there 's someone who makes back panels who refuses to make them to the exo terra specs for some strange and obscure reason i 'll get a zoo med .
for reference this is the kind of diy background https www.glassjungles.net/blog/2019/5/26/eurostyle-vivarium that i love .
or this https www.neherpetoculture.com/custombackgrounds does n't look that fancy until the plants establish themselves but after that it looks pretty fucking cool .
if you do n't know of anyone doing stuff like that what else could i try ?
really the only exo terra foam background i 'm okay with is the rock pattern .
but i do n't see a way to put any planters in/on it .
plus i have my heart set on creeping fig/ficus pumila and i 'm not sure if it 's got enough texture .
i set my intention to the numbers 111 which my roommate and i have been seeing constantly in random places .
the location generated was exactly 11.1 miles from my apartment which is utterly mind blowing .
i was downloading apex legends on the origin installer and i left it to install .
when i came back to check on it my computer was in sleep mode so i clicked the mouse a couple times and when it turns back on it opens to the microsoft store on the download page of a game i 've never heard of called fantasy star online 2 .
i then got a notification that said there was a problem with my account i clicked the notification and it took me to settings then told me to type in my password so i did and then the warning went away .
i am wondering if i this is a problem or just a weird fluke or something .
did anyone find thursday reccomendation off in terms of going half a a size down from your sneaker fit ?

i am seeing several new 2019 scrambler 1200 xcs listed on cycletrader for 10k .
of course this could be a clickbait price and otd could be bloated .
but if this is a legit price and otd just adds tax and doc fee any ideas why it 's so low ?
any known issues with the scrambler 1200 xc or that year in particular ?

i always think about how when i 'm a physician i will always want to be ready to help if anything arises and having a medical equipment bag would be a cool thing to have really nicely stocked .
so my title kind of says it all what are obtainable/important things a physician who wants to always be ready to have in supply ?
i 'm thinking basically a bag that an emt would have .
but how would they go about getting all these things ?
like if you do n't know anyone with an allergy can you still prescribe yourself albuterol to stock in your bag ?
could you get access to all things to run a code ?
whenever i see stuff like this i do n't usually downvote it because i know it 's usually going to be made fun of because it was posted on subs like r/forwardsfromklandma or r/forwardsfromhitler subs like this one that make fun of far-right memes .

well why are the jewish people prospering under capitalism while other races especially blacks are n't ?
both groups are targets of racism however systematically speaking there 's something very different going on .
i do n't believe there 's a jewish conspiracy but i do believe there are plenty of racist jews in power like bloomberg responsible for this .
or perhaps there 's an argument i have n't seen yet which debunks the entire notion that wealth inequality favors certain races .
as far as i can tell it seems to run great only losing a few seconds daily .

the answer is simple ... . here is where homophobes lose their shit it 's because like it or not the show has established lena as the most important relationship kara has besides alex and katie as the third lead in the show .

the best way is either with mei or hammond .
the idea behind the rein/zarya brawl comp is to stay grouped .
if you separate a tank by either a walling one off or b booping one out of position the other team will have to scramble and expend a lot of resources to get grouped again .
another solid philosophy against brawl is using off angles effectively .
rein 's biggest weakness is shown when he 's getting attacked from multiple angles at once .
get some dps on high ground have your off tank monkey or hog etc go in on a flank while you as sigma push front line .
9/10 they will be forced to back up and deal with each angle before advancing

honestly we never know but i trust the economist as do many business people i know .
but as to faking gdp i think most people generally mean government officials in china taking out loans and spending it endless road repairs and construction projects .
i have a friend from china who told me that 's what they mean by rigging gdp not making it up because the communist party actually can check that .
obviously these are not core economic activities which is why most people discount them as part of real gdp growth

i have two cats brothers that we adopted when they were six months old both desexed .
about three years ago i started noticing yellow liquid splashed against surfaces .
i had no idea what it was because it did n't smell like cat pee though there was a smell .
i did n't know what it was until i saw little pissy-boy back his butt up against the wall one day vibrate his tail and whooosh out it came .
previously i thought someone else in the house had been messy with splashing oils and stuff when putting things out for the trash .
we took him to the vet immediately and he got the all clear for infections and the diagnosis was anxiety .
we left the vet with an expensive feliway diffuser and the bits to go with it .
plugged it in the next day he 'd sprayed right on the diffuser .
he 'd spray not urinate on and against everything including the kitchen counters whatever was on the counter microwave fruit bowl blender even on the bowl of tomatoes .
i was cleaning this up six times a day .
we had to remove everything literally that could be sprayed on .
we took him back to the vet this time he was put on pills .
which did nothing he would merrily spray away standing right next to me .
there was a neighbourhood cat who kept coming up to the window trying to attack so maybe that little bastard started my poor pissy-boy spraying .
we tried the usual things numerous vet visits to rule out infections the cats have their own large clean litter trays cleaned the sprayed areas and everything with stuff that is recommended to remove the scents sprayed those areas with a bunch of cat-repellent concoctions did n't work he 'd spray on them within minutes lots of attention using aluminium foil on surfaces citrus smells etc etc .
pissy-boy has always been really hyper like climbing curtains while his brother is more a lazy ass lazybones .
they got along well and never really fought so there was no stress there .
it got so bad with the spraying we ended up building a large outdoor enclosure because it was impossible to have pissy-boy inside the kitchen area blocked off from the rest of the house because he 'd spray on every.single.thing .
now he is not allowed in the house unless we are holding him because he will spray something the second he walks in .
he is very happy to spend his time out in the enclosure which is a positive i guess and we 've made it like a playroom .
i am cleaning the laundry room daily where the cats sleep eat and have the litter tray because he sprays against the walls doors in the laundry trough .
he jumps on the washing machine and sprays on the panel and if the lid is open to air out the tub he goes in the tub and sprays .
their water bowl is in the trough sink because they keep tipping it over when it 's on the floor but he sprays right next to his water bowl .
he sprays on his bedding too all the time but sleeps on it anyway .
it 's incredibly stressful his spraying has gone in to the tile grout crevices in the walls i ca n't get to and i 'm sick of stepping in it nearly every day .
i 've read the vet advice the subreddits the everything on the internets .
he loves our attention but i can not have him in the house unless i or someone else is holding him so he 's not getting much time with us because obviously we ca n't do stuff like cooking and our work while holding him .
i 'm looking in to buying a cat sling so i can carry him hands-free .
my pissy-boy drives me nuts but really he 's a sweet good natured little thing and i feel awful that he 's not allowed inside anymore .
but he sprays on stuff including things we ca n't reach such as the tops of the kitchen cabinets against the wall .
his lazybones brother was allowed inside but then he sprayed on the front door then the back door .
but it 's definitely pissy-boy who does all the spraying because we 've seen him and had a camera set up it 's like he says there 's my bed !
there 's the bottle of detergent up on the shelf !
if you 're a fan of red dwarf it 's like that scene where cat has a bottle of spray and goes mine !
since irl during fascist rule the mafia was put on his knees by cesare mori more known as prefetto di ferro '' iron prefect using his large range of action and with the help of the black shirts .
the mafia got saved only by the anglo-american landings in sicily in 1943 soo since fascist rule never ended is the mafia dead or is it hiding ?
maybe with the democratization of italy especially with the democrazia cristiana 's one the mafia could be able to get in business once again .
based on scouring karaoke posts on reddit i have ordered the following .

i 'm looking to buy and i 'm looking for a very foamy concentrated 15-20:1 shampoo and wax .
i 'm certainly looking for someone with a volume discount .
currently the places does 150vpd self and in the summer another 100vpd on the auto .
forgive my ignorant ass for asking this but i 'm white and so i basically ca n't tell .
it 's easy to talk about facts and this and that but these days no one gives a shit about facts because the other side screwed them up .
so for me what it comes down to are stories .
you ca n't really say someone 's story is wrong and you ca n't really consider someone a number when you hear their story .
if you dont have one here is an amazon link https www.amazon.com/mitchell-ness-malone-swingman-jersey/dp/b077smttnp/ref=sr\_1\_1 ? crid=2o6buaneg01nx dchild=1 keywords=karl+malone+jersey qid=1590754971 sprefix=karl+malone 2caps 2c316 sr=8-1 https www.amazon.com/mitchell-ness-malone-swingman-jersey/dp/b077smttnp/ref=sr_1_1 ? crid=2o6buaneg01nx dchild=1 keywords=karl+malone+jersey qid=1590754971 sprefix=karl+malone 2caps 2c316 sr=8-1
hi what do you guys/gals think of this prebuilt for 1100 ?
i want it mostly for gaming not much else .
hoping it can get me through path of exile 2 and maybe diablo 4 ... currently just playing random stuff on an old desktop about 5 yrs old and itching to upgrade .
it 's a conversation that takes place about an hour into the movie in fact almost exactly an hour .
i think it 's got really great potential considering our current ... y'know ... situation .
i wanted to get this out to the group .
i recently got word of a class action lawsuit concerning the secondary timing chain guides .
they are apparently settling and i received a notice to take part .
it only applies to 2005-2007 xterras that were bought in colorado florida maryland massachusetts new jersey new york oregon north carolina texas and the repair was done before the truck hit 120,000 miles .
i made a video on it if you want to take a look you can find that here https youtu.be/\_3ixhmncghk https youtu.be/_3ixhmncghk
also i posted the full notice that i received in the form of a pdf .
you can find that here if you want to take look http rtcg.tv/2020/05/29/nissan-class-action-law-suit http rtcg.tv/2020/05/29/nissan-class-action-law-suit

unfortunately it 's not showing the 360/90 degree levels one saber levels in the timbaland dlc pack .
i thought about maybe trying later to start again and before restoring game data make sure the dlc packs installed the levels before restoring ?

i wanted to know your opinion on the subject like what race class would be great for that what alignment should i be etc .
i would like to know how to integrate amazon prime video with the tv app on apple tv 4k .
i can only see the apple tv contents inside the app .
what i mean by that is units who change their class and/or origins during the round .
i had this idea with the upcoming inclusion of astronaut gnar so let 's use him as an example
while in mini-gnar form he would be categorized as say an astronaut-sniper just hypothetically and therefore benefit from the sniper synergy and dealing more damage at range .

what would you think of units that change their type throughout a round ?
what about units that go back-and-forth each time they cast their ability ?

i 'm a left-of-center intellectual person in my 30s .
like most people fortunate enough to have a stable home life growing up i grew up thinking things were just fine almost like learning about bad things '' that happened in history were now over and that modern times issues are resolved .
of course as i got older as most do i learned more and more that the current state of the world is more of a work in progress '' .
my ideology then became as a good person i should do whatever i can to help things get better ! ''
after a number of years of this i have seen things get worse in my opinion not trying to get too political but it 's not just politics pollution runaway capitalism loss of regulations sustainability climate change neo-facism etc .
i am now of the opinion that as an individual i most likely ca n't fix things in a large-scale meaningful way so i prefer to micro '' .
i keep myself informed of world events news etc but i no longer feel outraged or upset by it instead i prefer to make my own tiny slice of reality as good as i can .
i have a job where luckily my hard work does result in micro improvements to the big picture i 'm a teacher so i do that as well as i can i garden compost recycle stay informed and i vote .
but most importantly i accept that i wo n't make the world into a utopian paradise though my actions and i basically just mind my own business .
i 'm posting this because some people i 've come across identify this approach as cowardly '' giving up '' or something along those lines .
but i think it makes more sense to kind of keep my head down '' and go about my existence in as positive a way as i can .
i know things are messed up but i have no interest in helping to make things better in the big picture .
i mostly try to just stay out of it '' and in fact i do n't even want to argue about it with anybody anymore .
thanks for reading and for any insight you 'd like to share .
edit 30/5/2020 12:25utc first i want to thank those of you commenting who actively contributed and helped me to broaden my perspective .
since it 's become nearly impossible for me to respond to every comment i feel the comments are mostly covered by one of the following categories
people who essentially are saying i do more than most or as much as i reasonably can and that i have the freedom to choose how much that is more power to me .
these are in the clear majority and confirm that my position is morally defensible .
people who point out that injustice and evil in the world thrives when individuals espouse my selfish perspective i have considered this carefully .
however many of those comments are either asking me to do things i already do stuff that i consider to be under my micro '' heading or are not clearly offering me any alternative actions to take .
i find some of those responses to be full of campy rhetoric insubstantial and unconvincing .
for example lets use 1930s germany as an instance to explore this perspective .
suppose i were a well-to-do citizen of some means and i saw nazis taking over .
my reaction would most likely have been to sell all my assets take a pile of cash and bail out with my family .
this was not an uncommon practice many people simply ran away from the nazis .
one could argue that had more stayed and fought '' things would have been different but i dunno ... .a large angry mob with guns vs. some civilians standing up for what 's right ?
instead the runners were able to live and have children and grandchildren .
scientists left and worked on the atom bomb for the u.s .
is n't it better to live through the situation than die meaninglessly ?
one death the hypothetical me in this case is inconsequential but the life of someone keeping their head down '' and in the extreme case running away can have far more utility .
people who are working on the phrase it is acceptable to ... '' it can be pointed out that this is mostly just semantics but i asked this question not because i had doubts about my perspective more like i wanted to take the temperature of a larger community to see where i stand .
it sounds like most of you would agree that it is acceptable and thus my view is unchanged .
ok this might be a stupid question ... but i 'm not really up to date on anything and i have n't heard anything from dan in ages .
he used to at least speak in phils videos from time to time ... and then when he didnt comment on the haircut i thought where is he ?
and i need someone to say my birthday is 7th of may '' to my face or i wo n't remember .
my birthday is next thursday '' can work for that year but i 'll forget it the next .
i 'm pretty sure she had a good laugh .
how tf did mike get pictures and video of ops gf sleeping with other people ?
i nearly stopped reading at that point wish i had .
tbh i 'd be more worried about my 'good friend ' having set up this covert recording of the person who was at the time my gf .
it 's just too unbelievable that all kate 's '' friends did n't just stick with her or at least tell her what the op was doing or even call the police about revenge porn .
same with op randomly turning up to a party with loads of people he did n't know striking up conversations with these people he does n't know about his ex-gf who they do n't yet know and all of them siding with him including the people responsible for giving out promotions .
her parents sided with a guy who was attempting to use revenge-porn as a means of humiliating and bullying their daughter .
hatsumi and savella broke up i actually love these editors what the fuck
i can understand being pissed at my older sister for that .
but throwing the box at you when your scared of cockroaches ?
no that 's a bit far and that 's not counting the mess he made with the cereal box
good job but the cop totally looks like an action figure .
us cops kill people anyway so why not be a hero ?
those pigs dont need a reason so people are free to give them plenty of reasons .
biden was a way better candidate than bernie he actually got people to vote for him unlike bernie who got only retweets

i meant decent when talking about his skill at the penalty kill .
and edler is good at blocking shots i am not denying that .
but he is also conceding a shit load of shots while he is on the ice .
edler was ranked 17/248 among defensemen with at least 150 minutes played on even strength for conceding the most shots per 60 minutes of ice time .
if you filter it to defensemen with at least 1000 minutes played at even strength edler was 3/108 .
just because you block shots does n't mean you are a good nhl defender .
there is a direct correlation in most cases between more blocked stats more shots against .
and if you are giving up so many shots on the ice you are not doing your job defensively as a top 4 d. and that can also be perfectly explained by this chart https i.imgur.com/jozzgpc.jpg .
he is too slow to catch up with most players in the league .
edler also gives up way too many high danger chances .
if you look at defensemen with at least 1000 minutes played on even strength edler is ranked 3/108 on xga/60 .
i mean the canucks defense in general https imgur.com/a/loiqwyo this year was pretty terrible .
and i have been watching the canucks since the west coast express .
i have seen edler in his prime and trust me he has considerably slowed down .
there used to be a time when he used to be very good at preventing neutral zone rushes .
for example this is the data https i.imgur.com/xo6rc1w.jpg from 2016-2018 when edler was still declining but was still a useful top 4 d. edler used to be even better before this but you are inevitably going to decline as you get older in a league where the players are getting younger and faster each and every year .
the large majority 90 of defensemen begin to rapidly decline at the age of 34 .
and edler has already shown signs of that through his 30s .
are you sure you want to find out i think this might be too dirty for the comments section .
i was personally rooting for gigi who i think really turned out these lipsync but i am very happy for jaida and i 'm excited to see how things go for her .
why did crystal 's music video seem like a 'dont hug me i 'm scared ' episode lol
and god damn gigi did such a great job in all her lipsyncs .
i thought i was going crazy when her outfit changed in take on me only for ross to point it out .
and i really was n't expecting her reveal in the final sync .
she looked like she had a full proper outfit only for it to transform rather than have an obvious reveal .
excited to see what all our queen 's do next !

i think smithing could be changed i. wah that you could smith rune plate at 92smithing and addy armor much earlier .
some high level loot combining could be move higher like dragonfire shield and dragonhunter lance etc and more stuff like that could be added to make use of higher smithing lvl .
also buff smithing cape so it would be worth while

when i was in highschool it annoyed me so much that everytime they asked i 'd just leave .
there is no valid reason to do that except discrimination .

i do n't think you have any right whatsoever to be annoyed .
whether she lied or not surely you know the rules ?
if you valued the safety of your family you would have acted within the guidelines .
your mother is manipulative yet but you are also irresponsible here .
you need to take some responsibility for your error in judgement .
read somewhere that the some looted food n stuff are being given to the protesters
does n't he realise that these transcripts were all from before the joint intelligence community assessment came out on 6th jan that the intelligence community were specifically witholding intelligence related to russia from flynn and that they do n't have all of flynn 's calls ?
you do n't have to believe me but you 're making a bad bet and i do n't need to doxx myself to prove it .
i think the real issue is that you 're struggling to admit you were wrong without creating an alibi or narrative .
you tried to say that this language of 2d or 3d was peculiar to my expertise .
most people do n't confuse 2d art for the dimensions of digital art .
you made this error and perhaps you are embarrassed but do n't be embarrassed .
if you keep coming for me though you will be embarrassed .
it 's admirable to admit it but you ca n't handwave your way out of mistakes nor should you and nor does it fool anyone who knows better .
you corrected me with declarative language before you realized that i am an expert but you do n't need to be an expert to understand 2d from 3d art .
you also made a basic logical error called a false dichotomy .
this is why i pointed out that you insisting that a 3d render is '2d ' art because of the digital render is like insisted that a man is not a man but a human .
it 's both but the distinction of '2d ' for a digital image is silly and unnecessary and it 's even more absurd when you insist that it 's 2d and not 3d when corrected by a graphics professional .
i 've been making video games and ar/vr for 30 years .
why the hell would you want to argue with me in my field of expertise in a language that is n't even your primary language when you agree that you got it wrong ?
that 's just pure butthurt insecurity on display for the world to see .
anyway i suggest you just take this somewhat polite exchange for what it is and learn from it .
do n't try to come at me with this 'you 're confused ' business because i guarantee you that it 's you who was confused .
now you 're trying to make it out like i 'm the asshole .
we do n't get acquire new technology or scientific findings by being butthurt about mundane facts .
when businesses are destroyed it 's not the police that get hurt .
have n't seen a person disqualify themselves so quick in a while .
totally agree he is an awesome character but that not change the fact i state is still true .
most fans forget he is a jerk he is not a good person and many of hos depictions in the fanfics especially on gwuncan are cringey because authors not embrace characters as their whole .
people are far angrier about the looting but close their eyes and look the other way when human lives are taken .
plain and simple if you do n't support the violence of the protesters then you support the violence of the oppressors .
not to mention what they call violent riots '' were actually just protests until the police showed up .
all participants are to be recognized as such unless you disperse .

999/1000 shift from full human to full bear under extreme stress/anger and a moon cycle too just for fun
but the protagonist is the .1 that also gets a traditional hybrid form as well and wreaks his competition and then escapes .
now the russian bear fighting ring leaders/mafia are after him at all costs and the only way he can go back to his peaceful life is to take on the goons that find him and use clues/phones/cars/etc to track down the leader and destroy all evidence of the man he was .

for people who have been playing a lot of questlock does zephyrs feel like a dead card in hand too often ?
it feels like he is rarely active until there 's 5-7 or less cards in hand and i feel like the space he takes in your hand in the early game would be better suited for more tempo or a little more removal to protect your health and save nether breath for going face in the endgame .
i know this is a relatively new deck i 'm just curious if other people have considered cutting zephrys as well .

umm i would say you hold the government accountable by 1 .
having them acknolwedge their wrong doings and apologize 2 .
helping to right the wrongs by assistance to the affected populations 3 .
changing policies to help those in need rather than marginalize or slaughter them 5 .
pretty simple how they could be held accountable problem is they hold the power so it will never happen .
i do n't want to be outraged i am outraged .

but it 's not like i made them do all this shit just so i have something to be outraged at they committed these atrocities and now i 'm pissed because this world could be such a beautiful place and these asshats destroy it instead of contributing to it in a positive way .
so i do indeed know who to be mad at and why .

then they need to see what resources they have available and if there is any other work that needs priority over these systems planning takes time they do n't just magically know all these things .
honestly i do n't think we will ever see eye to eye on this argument on reddit .
you bring up some good points but i do n't really agree with your way of thinking and i get that you do n't really agree with mine .

he 's detailed a child taking her clothes off repeatedly and explained she 's just getting changed but it makes him uncomfortable ummm do n't look ... i expected it to not go any further except he 's started a fantasy dialogue of do n't you like seeing me naked ? a five year old child never says that and she did n't he made that up because he thinks she will say it hence his sick fantasy .

are you sure you want to seduce someone who you only have a crush on ?
i hope it 's more than that because crushes tend to be teenager things having more to do about your own hormones than it is about him .
ask yourself this very important question how will you feel if after you 've seduced him he stops with you and pursues another woman ?
what 's important is your heart and are you risking breaking it by doing what you 're doing .
here 's my trade review i shared in another response with the setup described above
it is extremely important that i confirm the formation of the expected setup before i enter a trade .
if the setup does not form i do not trade that day .
if the setup fails i will exit the position asap .
i will go through a possible trade you could have played with my setup on friday may 15 2020 .
step 1 scan the market for pre market gappers that meet the following criteria avg .
volume above 1 million float below 150 million gap up above 5 price range below 10 .
from the list i 'd have identified my primary trades as acb srne .
step 2 before market open check the monthly yearly charts for both .
notice srne has a history of releasing news causing massive spikes return to a baseline .
srne has gapped up 60 pre market to 4.20 seems like a prime candidate for long play .
step 3 establish levels of support resistance create a trading plan before market open .
4.15 3.85 are levels of support that srne can gap down to before a reversal to a long trajectory .
use the 3-5 minute candles to see if srne is gaping down to the support levels and making a reversal to a long play .
switch to 1 minute candles as srne hits 3.85 builds momentum upward .
notice 3 heikin ashi candles form begin rising above the smma .
wait for the small pullback as a confirmation of entry .
step 5 enter the trade with a risk to reward of 1:3 .
ride srne to its resistance levels or until it drops below the smma red line .
i 'm wanting to work on a big outdo moonlit gallery so i would love the art to display it all here ! 😍✨

ah well it 's 20 years ago so my memory may not be as clear .
for example i never succeeded to change a text value on a stateless widget that was defined after the initialization .
simply it was n't re-rendering no matter what event or user input happened .
no plan to release the game in mainland so far which supposedly will be handled by tencent and censors should follow after .
afaik many of these cards could be censored for arab or sea region such as in indonesia .
also could be in korea in which they would want to get a lower-age restriction .
i do n't know guys can we hard-confirm these are for mainland only ?
afaik many countries have censorship or strict esrb-equivelence that would require that kind of censorships .

whatever you think about the exchange that was not a sucker punch .

the wave of support for kellen 's petition to bring justice for george floyd and his family is unprecedented and truly inspiring '' change.org said .

as others have said a lot of it is big spoilers !
in the broadest terms he feels very disconnected from modern thedas .
he carries a lot of guilt and you will find out that he is trying very hard to correct his mistakes .
befriending him is worthwhile it has the capacity to change his entire outlook .
but there 's a reason for it that you will learn .
and he becomes arguably less asshole-ish if you take the time to understand him and show him compassion .
hes my favorite da character and one of my favorite characters ever but i understand why people do n't like him or are put off by him .

if you are n't a legally established organization with the irs and state government which will require bylaws and at least in california you have to register the names of the president secretary and treasurer and have the ei number and state numbers you are n't a non-profit that will really hurt your credibility .
and you ca n't get a bank account without those numbers .
i 'd be amazed if donors asked where you bank especially for amounts this small that 's not an issue .
so tell us the real truth are you really up for starting a real non-profit or have you already ?
is there any tricks you used to hunt for shiny 's ?
there was absolutely no difference in pressing it or not that 's what confused me .

when i was a toddler i thought wrestling rings were made of concrete .
they only partially went to capitalism because communism was killing all of it 's people especially under mao .
i wonder how many people who gave the game a good review actually played it after that .
my guesses of number who did would range from zero on the low end to also zero on the high end .
i did n't know about right click resize thanks for that .
it works on other floating windows but not this one for whatever reason though .
10 low priority wins are n't the usual punishment for a couple unlucky abandons in a short period of time for your average player .

if it makes you feel better a few years back i traveled almost 2 hours one way to meet this guy i had been talking to at a cafe .
i ordered a small black coffee and he got some big fancy speciality latte .
we seemed to be getting along well the conversation flowed but after about 30 minutes he ended it because he had to go meet a friend at some art show thing i was not invited .
and on top of it all he wanted to split the whopping 9 bill so i basically went all that way just to pay almost 5 for a 2 coffee .

i was informed that ultimate hunter was what mango fish ran when setting up my rune page that 's awkward .
i figured what was going on is that he was allegedly pairing ultimate hunter with sudden impact and scaling cdr to assassinate the most important targets quickly before he needed ravenous in a longer fight .
and i had a lot of success running this build too when i played it so i figured it was fine .
the electrocute=ravenous and fleet=ultimate hunter rule of thumb might still apply then .
sudden impact makes sense with the playstyle too because he intends to gigafarm and if he 's gigafarming he 's proccing taste of blood less often in lane by using his q more often on the wave than an enemy champion .
if you are let me know i can give you the nmt equivalent

have people found a good place too place their farming plots around calph ? .
i found a somewhat untouched area but its so lumpy and my plots wont get placed down within short distance and its just time consuming mess to run and harvest from all .
i was aiming to get my stuff out this afternoon 5/5 but i keep an extremely erratic schedule not really by choice and i think it 's going to be tomorrow instead .
i did however find some goodies in my plant room and i made an art so i made good progress .
do n't know if anybody will see this but if you come looking for me while i 'm asleep i did leave a trail .
i 'm running into the situation where prospective takers are asking exactly what is included with this dog and i am feeling a little leery that perhaps i am doing something wrong .
they tend to ask if he comes with his leash and collar and dog food bowl .
a leash is 15 a collar is 10 a bowl is 10 .
whenever we have gotten a dog we have always gone to the store to pick out these things fresh for that dog and considered it part of the responsibilities of owning a dog and part of bonding with the dog .
we are asking a small amount of money as a rehoming fee to make sure that he does n't become a violence victim and hoping that this money says that the owner will be able to afford the dog .
we are including an awful lot of stuff with this dog that is probably somewhere in the 300 to 400 range but we do n't want to tell people that we are including it because we do n't want someone who just wants free stuff for their dog and will ditch our dog in the desert .
are people who are asking these questions big red flags that they actually can not afford the dog ?
are they just wanting to take the dog home right now and did n't want the inconvenience of having to go to the dog store or are n't sure if the dog store is open ?
are they just asking because they do n't know what else to ask ?
should i take a stand and say no you need to purchase these things for your dog because he is your dog now and this dog needs a clean break from the past ?
i just feel really funny about these questions and i do n't know where to send i feel too close to this ginormous box of stuff that we are including and afraid to tell people about unless they ask directly .
and even if they ask they still ask are we including his leash and collar and bowl and it just feels f up .
so i recently started watching sailor moon and have watched most of the first season mark any spoilers please lol .
i 'm wondering what people 's opinions are from a feminist perspective on the show .
personally i can see a lot of both positives and negatives .
i think the show is very good at pulling off weaponized femininity '' .
the main cast of characters are pretty highly feminine women but at the same time the show makes it clear femininity is n't a weakness all of them are very brave and tough and risk their lives .
it 's reminiscent of the girl power '' feminism of the era the show was released in .
the female main cast regularly save a male character tuxedo mask .
early in the show he saves them but about 2/3 through the first season he is in need of saving much more frequently .
at one point a villian directly insults the cast based on their gender saying they need a man to save them .
they immediately disagree with him and back that up by combining their powers to severely injure him at which point he flees .
on the negative side their outfits are pretty sexualized and during the transformation sequences it can feel a little fanservice-y .
sailor jupiter in particular has a full 360 degree circle around her skirt in her sequence .
additionally the main character usagi has some unhealthy ideas that are n't condemned as strongly ad they could have been .
in one episode she 's very over-concerned about her weight/body image keep in mind she 's literally 14 and although the episode seems to imply this is bad she does n't seem to understand that by the end of the episode .
there is n't really any non-gender-conformity outside of the antagonists until a few seasons later .
the protagonists are highly feminine women and highly masculine men .
finally the anime made the main character 's love interests 2 years older than in the manga which is ... not great .
one guy is an 18 year old dating a 14 year old .
i 'm trying to create an applet to automatically share posts i make in my facebook business page to my personal page .
i do n't even get the option to go that direction when choosing my triggers .
i have a pelikan m200 with a broad nib and i love it .
however the section is a bit to thin for longer writing sessions .
i 'm considering an m800 but are pelikan gold nibs comparable in line width to the steel nibs ?
as in will a gold broad nib be the same line width as the steel broad nib ?
i see various information on the web and unfortunately there is no retail store near me where i could test one .
i 'd be happy to at least be able to type letter by letter with my voice .

my question is regarding a will contest in california .
i have no experience with legal matters so i have been shocked by what i have seen so far .
the contest is based on pure fiction and demonstrably false allegations .
also the grounds for contesting this will are all 4 reasons you can contest a will undue influence forgery improper execution and lack of testamentary capacity .
i do n't understand why someone would do this .
to my mind it makes the contest look more like a fishing expedition and less of a sincere effort to right a perceived wrong .
also why would the party contesting the will file a book of bald faced lies ?
i asked my attorney if all this dishonesty and viciousness was the normal way to contest a will ?
my usually calm prim and proper attorney surprised me by blurting out hell no this is not normal but she 's a vindictive bitch ! ''
if my attorney can see that then i 'm guessing the judge will see that too .
so how does making it obvious that one is a greedy vindictive liar who will say anything to get the will thrown out possibly sway a judge to rule in one 's favor .
lately i 've been obsessed with a particular style of music that i 'm not sure what to call .
it 's basically soundtracks by italians for mostly spaghetti western films .
the sound is like a mix of western music with classical jazz and even a bit of psychedelia .
i 've since found a lot of other classical composers with similar styles but i was wondering have this style ever influenced more mainstream pop acts ?
if so are there discord servers to talk and join games together to observe battles ?

i 've had it for a few years now but i feel like it was way over-hyped prerelease .
i like that it removed things like the bedtime restrictions and that it added all the new class options still have n't completely figured that one out .
still i find myself missing the simplicity of the game before the update .
it 's just too complex to thoroughly enjoy anymore .
trying to remember the name of the batman villain who hid behind the walls wallpaper and the general interior of a house stalking batman .
he did n't have any powers as far as i remember it was just a creepy comic where he would climb around the interior structure of the house .
i think it was detective comics and i thought his name had something to do with spiders but i 'm not too sure .
a long time ago my grandma got me a book that i neglected to read and now am looking for it again about 10 years later and have no idea what the book was about so i 'll describe it as best i can .
on the cover was a golden knight armor in a swampy area looking at the viewer each book had its own gemstone color to mark its place in the series of i believe different adventures .
no idea who the author was nor the name of the book or i would n't be here .
so i just meditated and was going through my memories when i saw this spirit who was a 10 in all categories with golden wings with diamonds sapphires rubys emeralds and another stone that i ca n't remember the wings were 5 feet long she did n't say anything just watching me does anyone know who she is
i 'm going to be livestreaming the premiere of a really long youtube video right now !

yes we have encountered this youthful civilization many times in the past . ''
that 's the fault of the legal system and the way it operates .
typically a lot of blue collar crime is violent which tends to call for incarceration .
white collar crime is n't which means the accused does n't usually end up in jail .
also you 're making a really unfair generalised assumption that all poor people get caught and hardly any rich do .
it 's just the nature of blue collar crime is easier to spot and process through the courts along with the fact that there are proportionately a lot more poor than rich people .
nonsense does n't stand up well to scrutiny so prohibit scrutiny .

could you elaborate on the thermal paste a bit ?
what 's wrong with leaving it like that since i only applied it yesterday ?
i do n't mind spending paste of course it 's just that from what i 've seen yesterday when lifting it trying to reattach it while fighting with the screws it was seemingly applied nice and evenly and i guess reapplying means cleaning the old one which i am afraid it would result in a bit of a mess .
or cleaning the one i put yesterday is n't needed ?

it 's to distract from what a failure trump is as a president and as a human being .

i would recommend this acer swift 3 https www.amazon.com/dp/b07mrwrhgc ? tag=bkadamos_alltest-20 because of the following

drag and drop sometimes does n't work as intended but that is easily fixed with software .
screen is glossy full hd ips with very good viewing angles the screen flickers at 200 hz in a brightness level of 20 .
if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive .
the main and maybe only con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get as it is not usable in direct sunlight .
has very good heat management and it does n't throttle .
speakers provide very clear sounds and the maximum volume is pretty loud .
battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage .
due to the virus a lot of laptops are being overpriced so make sure to check this list of overpriced laptops https www.reddit.com/user/lonerim2/comments/g94llq/lpt_dont_buy_new_laptops_now_unless_you_really before you buy any laptop at the moment

huh you know what i checked the rating distributions for the two seasons .
diamond 2 season 6 was top 2 which is around champ 1/2 now .
so statistically that means champ 2 now is a bit better than season 6 since players get better over time and the top 2 in season 6 will be worse than the top 2 in season 13 .
but it 's not as big a difference as i expected .
yeah but overall brazil has higher crime rate than many countries

well that would n't have been an issue if she had just retired under obama instead of holding out for hillary to appoint her replacement .
super realistic stealth game especially on first/third person is n't fun imo .
it was hitscan and guns had different ranges before bullet dissapeared
i do n't think the diamond analogy is a great one because resources are finite .
1 diamond is much more valuable than if 1000 's are available .
whereas 1000 people having a degree does n't make the 1 degree any less valuable .
everyone can be educated and high numbers of educated people does n't decrease other people 's education .
but if you 're saying that a public university would n't maintain as high a quality as a private university well that 's one i maybe ca n't answer .
i know american universities like harvard have a lot of prestige and are desirable but i think other countries have great education systems also .
but i ca n't really comment on a comparison of quality between a top university in sweden compared to harvard .
well there were n't 18 flags thrown so it was n't hochuli 's crew
luckily i bought the console on my own so i usually end up getting to be player one .
also the reason it 's a few bad apples spoil the bunch is not because the bunch is literally horrible but because people will remember the bad apples .
in their mind the bunch is now bad too when in reality it 's only the few bad apples that are bad .
im pretty sure it 's a joke account and even if it is n't spamming someone like that is a massive dick move and such a scummy thing to do

as for things that come to mind businesses are banned and subject to fines and shuttering for lgbt discrimination the constitution extends protection of equal rights to anyone regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity and you can change your gender on official documents without surgery .
from what i understand is same-sex marriage was n't considered a prominent issue by lgbt groups because unmarried people have the same rights as those who are married but the constitution does not ban same-sex marriage and it is subject to local laws .

before i get any sort of refund or break on the prime service that i pay for i expect for them to take care of all of the bs going on with the distribution center employees including hazard pay .
once all of that shit is sorted so that people who worker there are safer than they are now and feel it then they can take a look at what is going on with the customers .
right now the customers have been and continue to take priority .
while i am more than grateful for the continued service as i am disabled and use prime as a need rather than a luxury my bill has already been paid ... and while they continue to ship many things out in a reasonable enough time period i need for those who are taking care of me to be taken care of .
it is may and about time that they come first for a bit .
you have the right to think differently and feel that they should spend time and take a look at prime cost vs service what they should do and the impact of that ... . as nothing is ever just a single decision by one person and done ... you have that right.. but do not think for one moment that i still do n't get it .

there 's a good reason i give a shit about killer mike 's political opinions .
hell even cardi b has a good head on her shoulders when it comes to this stuff .
the backlash against sidewalk was funded and led by balsillie still a major shareholder in blackberry .
that 's why balsillie was pushing the angle that only canadian companies should be allowed to do such important work .
they wanted the easy money of single sourced city contracts .
so all balsillie had to do was frame it as the big evil google coming for your privacy and wave the nationalist flag and everyone lapped it up .
google did n't kill this because of covid but because the backlash was too strong .
now our cities are strapped for cash the blackberry project is going nowhere and the land will continue to sit idle .

i do n't know about 2010 but with my 2007 ex-l and my wife 's 2007 ex .
i dealt with bad ac compressors on both cars .
there were door lock recall both broke before the actual recall but they still covered it .
my ex-l starter just died friday at 195k which is n't that bad especially with our cold brutal winters here in the north .
also to add both vtec solenoids had to be replaced at 180k .
in the grand scheme of things none of these are huge expenses beside the ac compressor .
i 'm more so just saying these are things to look out for when looking at this car .
from my understanding and research the issue i had are pretty common .

the more angles to watch that babe the merrier .

we have pretty different views on how the economy works .
a couple things for you to consider incorporating into your model
productivity and output are better measures of an economy 's health than aggregate employment it does n't matter how much labor we put into the machine what matters is how many goods come out the other end .
you ca n't fund a basic income by taxing the rich or anybody else .
taxes do n't actually fund government spending production of goods funds government spending .
you have to ensure the economy is productive and is producing resources for that money to buy .
this is the same way all government spending works .
taxation for revenue is a meaningless concept at the federal level and we should care much more about the inflation rate than we do about budget deficits .
governments do n't need to worry about who pays for it ? ''
they have to worry about who resources their spending .
the money they create by fiat https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_money whenever they spend .
they can make this spending sustainable by ensuring there are goods for that spending to claim and maintaining a stable inflation rate 2 .
taxes are just a tool for the government to manage the resource economy and change incentives for citizens .
cheaper isnt always better you get what you pay for .
i have literally bombed that oscp certification due to how fucking hard it is .
i got everything completed for the first few phases and then got stuck with a technical issue that even my notes and google could n't resolve before the clock ran out .
as someone who has passed just about every certification test he has taken this one and project beta they changed the scoring model which led to a failing score old one i would have passed are the only two i have ever failed to pass .
i give massive props to anyone who has passed this exam .
avery has not been on the show very much .
i think the show gives ramona a pass to be rude in her approach .
she is very successful and seems to have a large social group outside of the show .
so she ca n't be that much of an asshole .
most copies that come with a prebuilt machine only has an oem version .

only scene in the entire show that bought a tear to my eye
hmmm ... other than our parents ... how about queen chrysalis the alicorns the mane six grover vi the archon and our buddies at the other worlds ?
i was thinking of the late original series to shippuden but that 's because i am one of the few who watched all 70 episodes of anime filler to actually have those appearances after his initial psychopathy has passed .
i would still call him one going forward though i did n't get far enough in shippuden to know if it stuck .
and then you catch your parents playing twister without even having twister

tbf dude 's old enough to be my dad though .

what way too many players/dms do n't understand is that your actions determine your alignment .
do what your character would do based on their history and personality .
not based on what 2 words you picked in character creation .

trickle-down washernomics works a bit better than the economic version but that is because the economic version does n't ever work at all .

you do understand that the quarantine was put into place to stop the hospitals from being overrun with patients not to stop the virus right ?
the virus is here to stay and quarantining healthy people while destroying the economy will not solve the problem .
the elderly gentleman or your niece know they 'll have to take precautions from now on but everyone else needs to go back to work .
this entire thing has been so politicized that common sense has gone out the window .

it 'd be weird transfeering that over to other games though for sure .
been telling people for years that if you insist on buying a 20 router use the switch your cousin found in the garbage and have ancient twisted up grimy network cables ?
it does n't matter how good your internet connection is it 's going to run like shit .
what exactly is the big deal with spending a moderate amount of money to have decent equipment ?
they 'll spend 1500 on a phone but wo n't drop 150 on a quality magic box to route all the traffic in their house .
i 'm australian and we have a ton of options .
my connection costs about 25 more than most peoples but has a low contention ration redundant links all over the place etc .
it works all the time and i get good speeds all the time .
meanwhile they buy unlimited data for 30 a month ! ''

your copyright for your music exists at the time of creation .
however if you want to protect your music and give your self the ability to sue someone if they stole your music you need to register your copyright at copyright.gov assuming you 're american .
registration is n't required to upload your music online they simply ask is it yours '' and you say yes . ''
that means if you make a cover song you can copyright your version of that song !
when you do the copyright you 'll specify its a cover and note the original writers .
you do this with form sr '' from the library of congress sr stands for sound recording .
that way if someone uses your cover illegally you could sue the same as if it was an original song .

governor kim reynolds joined four other republican governors including the leaders of nebraska and wyoming to co-author an op-ed for the washington post on may 5 titled our states stayed open in the covid-19 pandemic .
the best is a comment at the bottom of the article
... the republican governors proudly referred to powering through last year 's historic flooding. the massive economic damage done by that flooding was largely due to the long and stubborn refusal of the governments of states adjacent to the missouri river to recognize how rivers function what flood plains are and the difference between wishful political thinking and hard hydrological reality .
i 'd be very interested in medical opinions of what the the governors had to say about the pandemic .
it appears to me that the same kind of wishful political thinking is in play . ''
might wan na cross post to r/honda but it sounds like your honda sensing needs to be re-calibrated assuming you have it .
the shaking from the steering wheel could 've been the lane departure system thinking that you were veering off the road and the brake from the screen could 've been the system thinking that there was an object in your way .
definitely take it into a dealer and disable all of the honda sensing features before whenever you drive it as the car automatically braking anywhere especially on the freeway could be bad .

i checked my voice meter banana nothing changed i tried ingame audio and windows audio and all that stuff but there has nothing changed from my side so it should be pubg by itself .
what i do not understand is that there was no update for pubg as far as i saw and they did not mention anything on twitter or anywhere else .
i played today with increased comp and fader gain but that is not the best solution .
the game gets so quiet when you shoot and then goes back to normal .

there has got to be a way where fanfic writers can be critically acclaimed as well as commercially '' .
i get right that fanfiction is it 's own oeuvre and it 's own thing .
and there is no shame in being a fanfic consumer who loves it for the downhome attractions its renowned for .
we all want cuddle-up fics with our fave characters .
but there must be a way yes i 'm shouting now to reassure these shy skilled accomplished writers that they have something to offer .
imagine these could be the next tolstoys hardys salingers or fitzgeralds who throw their hand in thinking fanfiction might be the way to test the waters .
you know what if catcher in the rye was posted on ao3 it 'd probably only get 20 kudos too .
would you still try to get published if your fic got 20 kudos ?
alright i 'm being mouthy today but before you downvote me i 'm not implying that trad publishing is superior to fanfiction i 'm actually complimenting realistically the number of hard-core quality writers who are contributing to this medium but there is only one way of measuring or valuing their work .
they may never have aspirations to write original or get published cool that 's perfectly fine if they 're content .
but it just seems such a shame that there is n't some way to recognize literary talent alongside audience appeal .

depending who you ask what distribution tool they are using and what espresso machine they have ... you 'll find mileage will vary and people have different and often conflicting opinions .

i 'm not really sold on one being better than the other .

accepting or encouraging their judgement feels like acknowledging their power to me .
occasionally someone posts about wanting to be excommunicated on here but it seems to me that resigning sends a better message to them .
the best way to reject their authority and morals is to do it affirmatively rather than defensively .
they have no authority and really they have no morals .
so why would you encourage them to pass a moral judgement upon you ?
so a guy with a small dick who is confident will be just as good at piv as a hung confident guy ?
he constantly says how dick size doesnt matter and girls do no reject guys for having small dicks
there are always going to be people whose job is basically play games 24/7 and do nothing that adds value to the world but getting mad at people who do this is like getting mad at people who do level 1 fist-only runs of dark souls .

i 'll answer the first question if you were using the official groups then it works exactly like that .
you join it and try to find a battle and it matches you with someone else doing the same thing .
however these groups are region locked so if you are struggling to find a battle it is likely that either the region you are a part of is n't particularly active i know in australia i had to get a friend to meet me in the group so i could get the titles because there is very rarely anyone else in them or you are just searching at a time where everyone is asleep

big shout out to u/borrtt who 's comments seemed to have been the problem solver .
i believe the issue was i did not flip off the psu causing some short of short in the m.2 when i installed the ram i had to repair the m.2 and put a fresh install on it .
the chkdsk results were the following m.2 correcting errors in the volume bitmap .
hdd windows has scanned the file system and found no problems .
i then proceeded power down the pc and unplug the hdd then rebooted it and went to the bios exited without saving or changing anything m.2 was the priority drive i get a black screen saying reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key '' .
i then proceeded to boot to the bios with a windows usb stick inserted and reinstalled windows this time it let me and did not force restart in a constant loop .
i am now running a fresh install of windows 10 thank you again everyone for your help .
i bought an additional 2x8 sticks of ddr4 ram for my pc i already had 2x8 sticks originally they are both the same brand timing voltage and mhz .
my desktop was completely off when i popped the 2 new sticks in but it would only restart over and over so i took out the new ram but even with just the original ram it would not run .
i can get to the bios and it reads all the ram but i ca n't boot to safe mode .
i 'm at a loss on what to do ... .

i m24 was playing video games with a childhood friend we 'll call him x m20 .
and i 've always felt like an older brother to him .
today i asked in a non threatening or serious manner if i could be his future children 's godfather and he quickly retorted depends on how well you do in life so i told him i 'd let him say that on the house and later messaged him privately .
me hey so usually i would n't say anything but your comment struck me in a way that you only value people based on how much wealth they accumulate in life .
i know this is n't true but it was the knee jerk response that made me think i should say something .
so as a friend i 'm saying that 's not what you should say to someone because it places a material value on them rather than the qualities ''
x ofc i do n't value people based on their material worth .
i 'm very offended that you think that i do .
but at the same time if i do n't think you can financially support my children then why would i make you their godparent ?
me i mean it was out of the conversation and if you feel offended i 'm sure you take that position seriously and of course i understand ''
x i just feel that you 're generalising a trait about me that i find very disgusting in other people .
you should know i 'm not like that but money is a necessity to make a child 's life more comfortable .
honesty i want you to apologise for saying that i only value people based on how much wealth they accumulate ''
me i suppose i just wanted you to know how i felt and like i said it 's something that you take seriously and maybe i did n't think about it ''
x i 'm sorry if i hurt your feelings but i 'm looking at it from a completely logistics point of view .
obviously on an emotional level you would be one of the best people to take care of my kids . ''
me perhaps that 's what i thought too it did n't hurt my feelings but it was the quick response so i did n't say my feelings were hurt i just wanted to point something out as a friend but i just want to be clear i said struck me in a way i never said it was a trait
i hope you can see that i genuinely reached out to you as a friend not expecting i should apologise for something i said ''
maybe i need to think on the fact that i responded so decisively and quickly ''
me but for the sake of our friendship and because i love you like a brother i did i hope we can look back on this one day and smile .
i still feel strange for apologising after he demanded an apology and i ca n't shake this feeling of sadness and disappointment .
can someone explain how to collapse to a skep trigger and maybe give some examples of skep triggers ?
i know what skep is on a very basic level but i want to learn how to read it and how it clashes with the aff fw especially when it is triggered in the 2nr .
also it would be great if anyone can paste the links to any good rounds that involved skep/skep triggers .

i 've always wanted to die and i picked the end of the year .
i 've been hoping desperately that god will send me a reason to live but i realize that i have probably convinced myself that this is the right thing to do .
i 'm a sophmore but i 've already given up for my life in the future of 2021 .
i do n't really care about sats or aps or anything anymore .
i just wish that people would stop caring about me so that it feels easier .
i feel like i 've been looking for reasons to get more depressed but unfortunately my life is looking better everyday .
i guess another big thing that i worry about is that perhaps i 'm not worthy of dying ?
everyone on this subreddit has so many i guess understandable reasons .
i do n't wish them harm and i hope none of you guys do anything to hurt yourselves but at the same time it feels hypocritical to say this because i want to hurt myself .
also sadly there are almost nowhere that promotes suicide or depression so..
there are so many people that deserve happiness and maybe i should n't be .
i 'm sorry about the lack of structure or anything .
as the title says i do n't know what to write .
i just wanted to get stuff at least some stuff off my chest .
who in your opinion has the best or worst nick names for there team ?
i know that a'lot of asian females use blonde bleach to color their hair 100 or in streaks .
i have even seen some men do this as well in 100 or in streaks .
i have seen some people with non black hair dye it black but that was relegated to subcultures like goth punk metal .
my question has anyone ever seen any regular person with non black hair go out to bleach their entire head or even with black streaks .
this might be a good question for the self haters .
after re-listening yeah i dont have time to read so i listen to the audio books .
but at the part where its describing his swords spren when they go to the cognitive realm i couldnt help but notice that besides the eyes it sounded like a spren similar to lifts .
that leads me to think that if adolin does join an order by bringing his blade back to life would he join the edge dancers since his spren seems to be of that order .
so i found someone to buy a gpu from however he lives around 4 hours away and we agreed on shipping and payment via paypal .
i 'll paypal him the money and give him my address and he will ship the gpu to me .
does paypal/craigslist have services in place to protect me in case this is somehow a scam ?
edit he only brought up shipping after i told him about the distance
it 's my birthday and i have nothing better to do !
what form of lubrication should i use on my barbell ?
it 's about 2 or 3 years old i do n't remember exactly how long ago i bought it it 's still in really good condition but it would n't hurt to do some maintenance .
edit thank you to everyone that gave me feedback !
i will make sure to not use wd-40 as i learned that it 's not a lubricant but a water displacement .
i will be using 3 in 1 oil or tri flow lubricant whichever i find first and a plastic bristle brush .
and once again my barbell and i are very appreciative of the feedbacks and this amazing community .
i redid my garden gave up halfway through trying to follow a guide to try and get more of the hybrids i want and need 4 peeps to water .

let me know if you 'd like the bells or if you want me to come water your garden !
i am a newer player few weeks and i 've been trying to work industry and mining a lot .
i love the relaxed gameplay and the fun of numbers and economics .
but everything i look at for bpo 's and making and selling things ends with a loss of isk because the market prices are so low .
the only thing i have seen to be profitable in making rather than just selling the ore made to use it is ammo and some drones .
but then it takes a huge volume of sales just to make 1mill every other day
does anyone have any suggestion as to what i can do ?
i work from everyshore with a industry and pve corp .
my partner and i have a rescue dog 3y/o mix breed 40lb f with some extremely deep rooted fears anxiety particularly around very bright and dark environments afraid of sunlight ... and the dark .
we 've been working with a behaviourist for some time and she recently suggested getting our dog 's vision tested for signs of early issues conditions .
our vet has checked her eyes briefly in a general appointment 6 months or so ago and said things looked normal .
the exam consisted of shining a light in her eyes but nothing extensive that i can recall .
wondering whether there is a more extensive eye exam for dogs and what a general procedure would be if it would consist of more than what i noted has already been performed above ?
zeo hatte ja in einem video mal gesagt das er eine eigenene reddid page hat .

i 'm at end of contact with my huawei p 20 and have been looking around for an upgrade .
really taken by oneplus and want opinions on the 7 pro 7tpro and both the new releases the 8/8pro .
am i right in thinking that the specs on the 7 series would be a step up from my existing phone ?
my concern is the reports i hear of the oneplus camera ... would it be worse than huawei p20 ?
is the op 8 much worse then the 8pro ?
busget is a factor ... but not the only one .
so i just bought a new 1t m.2 nvme drive as i was constantly running out of room on my old 256m ssd .
i checked the specs of my mobo asrock z270 killer sli/ac and it listed 2x ultra m.2 socket pcie gen3 x4 sata3 '' with an astrix detailing that it supports nvme ssd as boot disks . ''
... but now i 'm reading something about how this ultra m.2 '' is potentially competing with my gpu for bandwidth ?
i 'm a pretty heavy gamer and i would be bummed if this drive i bought as an upgrade turns out to decrease my gaming performance .

the convention hall is crowded with fans of all kinds a good many of them cosplayers .
this con in particular was known for its cosplay and while every serious cosplayer in the region is expected to come to this con at least once the fact that its the con with the worst groping and harassment problem is its worst-kept secret .
you knew this when you made your plans to come here .
you were n't about to let that stop you from wearing what you wanted however never mind the fact that you were n't originally so eager to do this before you heard about this con 's reputation .
you envision yourself strutting proud sexy and strong into the convention hall standing up to the first person to harass you and making enough of a stink about it that the con starts taking these incidents seriously and plasters so many cosplay is not consent '' posters everywhere that you ca n't walk ten feet without passing one .
you imagined you would be praised all over social media for giving the girls of this convention the freedom and security to dress how they choose and go down in history as one of the great leaders of feminist history .
then you actually get there wandering the con alone attending panels and shopping for merch but you soon find that everything you came here to fight against is so much more intimidating and degrading when its for real as you realize that someone is following you ... creep-staring making degrading comments groping you during photo ops ... taking creep shots of you on his phone ... everything that you want 'cosplay is not consent ' posters at this con because of ... and no one is stepping in to help you .
standing up for yourself feels so much harder now and the harassment lasts the entire day from when you start walking around the con and continuing when you head to your room and it seems all you can think about is how humiliated and degraded you feel that you hate this costume for the way no one takes you seriously in it that maybe it is your fault that this is happening and you just should n't cosplay if you 're not asking for it that maybe just maybe you really are just attention-whoring ...
and then you realize your convention creeper has followed you into the room and no amount of posturing as a strong independent woman is going to take his hands off of you ...
in the past i 've posted a prompt with very similar themes where a cosplayer is raped in her hotel room at a convention but this time around i 'm looking for something a little different .
this prompt focuses more on the buildup to that with me following you around generally harassing and objectifying you .
while i do want to spend plenty of time on that i still do want to get to the sex in the end and to spend a good amount of time on that as well why have all that buildup if the main event is practically an afterthought after all ?

there are only a couple of videos online with the english subtitles .
i just lost an extremely tense and fun game because when the gas masks do their little bounce flip in the gas before they explode they can not be picked up the progress of holding the button to pick them up is interupted by the bounce this meant i was stood in the gas dying while trying to pick it up .
ironically if i hadnt bothered trying i would have been fine .
i 'm very new to this subreddit and i was just wondering if anyone could comment with some good minarchist flag examples trying to pick which one i like most and going to order a custom flag for it .
it has been more than a day but i can not open my daily loot chests .
when i try and look at my profile the game says something went wrong .
i do n't think i am connected to the internet but reddit yt and other internet needing things still work fine .

yesterday i wore the react 87s the first time while walking my dog .
after some minutes they started to hurt my ankle and even caused a little bleeding on the right ankle .
i found out that that 's quite a common issue ...
i 'm wondering if it goes away after some more wears and if the shoe just needs a little time to break in .
or should i not even bother and just sell them as long as they are just one wear old ?
tears break through in my numbness i begin my biggest fear .
i am not good enough and flawed and such .
i do n't ask for much just respect and love .
i work for everyone to have a home so to speak .
but it is driving me to look over the peak .
the precipice i look down and see.. ready now to make that jump and may be then they will see me ?
is it selfish maybe it is so but i am so tired of being down this lonely road .
my heart hurts my soul is done may be if i was gone ?
i will try to heal but i am not sure how ...
they waited until all my pto vacation and upt were used up before denying my case .
i was told by erc to stay home if someone in my household has a fever .
i did and now i am fired for listening to them .
told me because it was my dad who has a fever its family leave and i do n't qualify for that .
even though i was exposed to him and was likely the reason he had a fever at all .
i 've worked in a qualifying position since february 2016 but never filled out a form .
would i just get forms from both employers filled out and send them in ?
i 'm also not sure my loans qualify and saw that the link to test them does n't seem to be working .
i am planning to buy a gaming laptop and was looking for some suggestions from the community .
i have shortlisted asus tuf fx505dv https www.amazon.in/dp/b07vrlx5y9 ? coliid=i3pertrz25bvgo colid=3652jfc4f4lqp psc=0 ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it primarily because it is giving me a 2060 within my budget .
i will be primarily gaming at 1080p and want to play most of the last aaa single player games .
what i know for sure about the movie was that it had as protagonist a young man who started involving with some mafia people he had a criminal friend called sony who accused him of putting an explosive in his car .
i have another vague detail but i could be wrong the whole story might actually be told from the perspective of an elder do n't remember if male or female but i think it ended with this person admitting knowing about a body sinking in the sea inside a car .
personally i 'm max lvl but had some of my mates start the game and remembering what its like to level up really sucks ... i mean 80k points for max lvl is just too much for any player f2p or p2p .
ok basicaly the thing is simple i got some grafic mods animations that i want to use on sv\_pure 1 so i need the preload room thing that i did i added the map and did the comand map\_background preload\_room wait 10 disconnect the things is the autoquit does n't work can someone give me a lil hand thanks
ps the preload room and all was from ytrium comp viewmodel since was the only one working
really wondering if the cemetary really revives anyone or if it is just demons possesing the corpses and animating them .
i have a 2004 lexus gx470 in my garage .
i 'm replacing the timing belt because i do not have a service history on the vehicle .
i 've disassembled the front of the engine but i have not removed any of the timing components .
i have the crankshaft set to 1 tdc using the reference mark on the crankshaft timing gear and the dimple on the oil pump cover as shown here https i.imgur.com/e5abg2m.jpg
however here is what the alignment of my cam pulleys look like
based off of the service data i 've been able to find the camshafts should be aligned with the '' on the cylinder heads when the crank gear is aligned with the dimple on the oil pump .
has this engine been running and driving with the mechanical timing out of sync ?
i 've had this truck in the family for almost 3 years and performed a large amount of services on it .
i 've not had any indication that the engine was mis-timed .
it does not misfire and it has a decent amount of power for an old 4.7ltr v8 .

the toll this is taking on me is phenomenal like absolutely batshit crazy .
that little shit was my best fucking friend and she recently went missing .
as of now there 's not a single night i do n't cry myself to sleep .
as pathetic as this will sound she was the only thing keeping me going .
not my friends or family however a cat named persephone .
i miss her so much every aspect of her .
she was the drawer that hid the sharp things away the only thing in my life that gave me the favor of equally returned love .
i am so sickeningly alone and all i could ever want is for my best friend to come back home to me .
i mean why ca n't they just shut up why do they have to keep spamming text money drop requests dm'ing me and stalking me .
rage is boiling inside me and i had enough .
i 'm killing me some of those money drop spammers and i 'm gon na kill em all .
back after a hiatus will accept all players at any trophies just come donate and have fun and we 'll push towards being active in wars soon as we have enough players to do so .
the last few years i 've been even more afraid of the dark than maybe when i was younger or maybe now i 'm more scared if my husband is not next to me because i got used to his calming presence .
anyway i 've had lucid dreams out of body experiences while sleeping and other varied anomalous experiences .
a lot of my memories have dissipated or maybe just deeper in my mind than i can access these days .
so the last few years i 've been very sensitive to the idea of something watching me as i sleep .
physically standing next to my side of the bed and just watching me .
i guess most related would be a shadow person i 'm just learning that term on reddit now .
now i say been sensitive to '' and not actually saw '' .
i 've gone to the kitchen in the middle of the night to get a drink of water and thought i 'd seen something sitting on the living room armchair staring right at me and other types around .
but i ca n't really tell if i see anything because i try so hard not to look at it .
it 's pathological how much i try to avoid letting these things if there is anything at all know that i can see them .
this is such instinct that when i turn in the middle of the night lightly awakening or whatever i keep my eyes closed and try to act '' like i 'm in deeper sleep than i am .
walking to the kitchen or bathroom at night i keep my eyes to the floor and just always act oblivious .
i 've tried to start a regular lucid dreaming practice .
a week or so ago i had a lucid dream 3 in one night !
in which i was aware i was in a dream aware my physical body was asleep in bed next to my husband and the intense feeling that something was watching me my physical body !
i knew this difference because like my super-ingrained instinct of acting '' more asleep than i am i tried to do that from my lucid dream !
from my lucid dream i tried to move my eyes more if i was already in rem i knew they 'd already be moving but for some reason i wanted to make sure it was super obvious to someone looking at my physical body and reminding my lucid self to stay calm and asleep .
my guess is that i 've had more experiences as a child that i 've forgotten over the years and my instincts are behaviours i 've taught myself to cope to not let anything know that i can feel its presence .
in seems that in being able to act oblivious i do n't show fear even though i do feel it but i try to keep a lid on it and that 's what seems to be the most important component/reasoning .
i know many have experienced this i sometimes get it after simply brushing my teeth after eating or it will just pop up when it feels like it .
i also have changed my diet to a gerd friendly one for over a month no changes .
hoping someone knows any tricks or tips to ease this symptom at least
looking for a clash team that is willing practices at least a few times a week .

you can not protect your ears in any way nor can you harm or do anything to dissuade the parrot or prevent it from biting/squawking in your ear .
you can not cut off your ears or deafen yourself to avoid your fate .
the parrot sits on your shoulder all day and can decide to bite you at any time including when you 're at work or asleep .
the bite is hard because the parrot has a large sharp beak and if either of your ears become too damaged they will be healed so that the parrot can continue its daily bites .
if you choose the screeching then the parrot will sit on your shoulder all day screaming its head off you can not wear hearing protection of any kind and the squawking will go on till you fall asleep and resume as soon as you awaken .
you can not use other noises to drown the sounds of the screeching out and your hearing will be restored periodically so the parrot can gradually deafen you again .
there is nothing you can do no matter what to prevent the parent biting/squawking and it will hurt your ears/hearing no matter what .
i started ynab at the end of march but really starting adding transactions in april now from the report i see the month as empty and it kinda messes the reports and their averages .

so yesterday i bought art of war i do n't really know what other dlc i should buy got enough only for 2 i was thinking in the cossacks and rights of man or maybe mandate of heaven .
so i 've gotten back into the game after a couple years away and i 'm in love again .
i 'll definitely being playing regularly again and as i 'm nearing 70 i figured now would be a good time to look for a guild .
so i started by googling guild recruitment for ps4 and honestly did n't really find much .
a lot of the links that come up are to forums that are several years old .
or if someone knows a good place to check out some guilds or simply had a recommendation that would be amazing .
i play everyday for at least a bit but i 'm really trying to avoid any of the sweatier groups .
i literally ignored my pretty much only friend because she wanted to facetime i told her i was grounded i 'm still living with parents .
just made me realize how far social anxiety has reached .
i have n't known her for too long but i am pretty comfortable for her but i feel uncomfortable during facetime always .
just wanted to know if there was an update in the community ?
i have three ps2 fat psu s all three consoles wo n't turn on and no standby light .
some of the research points to a blown ps1 fuse on the mobo so i just want to make sure i rule everything else out before i start soldering and desoldering .

my 10 yo son wanted one and i wanted to support simon my favorite player to watch so i purchased a few but then noticed it sold out within 12 minutes .
it 's almost the anniversary of my cannabis induced psychosis which happened on 10.06.2019 and been recovering from it ever since .
i 've ever only felt progress since late october of 2019 .
i used to be on paliperidone and olanzapine stopped using olanzapine and lowered dosage of paliperidone now .
the thing is everything was going very smoothly since late october 2019 but very recently since 2 days ago i started feeling mildly paranoid and my brain started to go on overdrive .
thoughts started racing on my mind and i 've been feeling quite unstable .
i have n't used any recreational drugs since mid november 2019 and i 'm clean .
i figured after a bit that it might be because i 'm watching 'six feet under ' at the time .
it probably triggered me due to all the drug related stuff and familial issues and death in the show .
it felt nice to realize this and i felt like my bad mood was over but i 'm still feeling mildly unstable .
now i 'm taking invega 3mg paliperidone without therapy for obvious reasons .
i mailed my doctor about this mood problem i 'm having which resembles last summer 's psychotic times and have n't heard from her yet .
i 'm feeling really uneasy and sad that i 'll probably have to raise the dosage of my drugs and even take up some more different stuff .
unstable without drugs and too numb to feel anything when drugged ?
it was like hell between the beginning of the psychosis and late october i barely used to feel anything and was delusional .
i 'm really afraid of resetting to that condition .
why am i starting to feel like shit again ?
everything used to be working just fine until two days ago .
do you have any similar experiences or any advice for me ?
i 'm really afraid of going under psychosis again .
i̇s there anything i can do to make it better ?
i have xbox game pass ultimate on xbox but when i go on pc game pass it says i have to buy it again

coronavirus germany to centralize supply chains set prices on masks protective gear
the covid-19 pandemic has led to global shortages of key protective supplies — and fraudsters looking to profit off the desperate need to procure them .
now berlin is looking at ways to fill the gaps and combat extortion .
così si sono inventati un prezzo che non sta ne in cielo ne in terra pur di punire quattro farabutti e mandando a puttane un intero sistema solo per accontentare le vostre erezioni da giustizia sociale
il prezzo che non sta nè in cielo nè in terra '' è probabilmente simile al prezzo che c'era prima di tutta sta pandemia .

i 'm very new to the perfume game and i ordered a sample of chanel no .
5 since it 's out of my budget but i wanted to try it and i had heard all the hype .
i opened the bottle sniffed it and said to myself yuck really ?
this is the shit that is over 100/bottle ? ! ! ''
however i decided after a couple of days to try it on myself .
immediately i said oh that 's what all the fuss is about ! ''
the same thing happened with ck 's obsession which was a blind buy dumb i know .
i sprayed it in the air and said oh no i 've made a huge mistake ! ''
but it clung to my skin and after the initial shock wore off it became one of my favorites .
i always thought that i 'd be a floral fragrance kinda gal .
i 'm finding that i actually prefer oriental/floriental fragrances more both on me and in general .
because i do n't have a personal history with a lot of perfumes things do n't remind me of grandma 's perfume '' or that perfume mom wore when she was frosting her hair '' i just like a scent and that 's that .
for example i absolutely love shalimar even though i 've heard people describe it as an old lady perfume .
he 's on a one year deal wo n't cost much .

i have no idea how he compared a-cold-wall to rick lolol they look nothing alike .
if anything i 'd say acw and chalayan are almost somewhat similar if i had to compare it to anything .

there was also a promo/commercial for one of those games where the entire premise was a hospital being super busy tending to a ton of criminals who batman had beaten up .

i believe that even aristotle would say that the hypothetical syllogism is not a defining feature of implication but rather an obvious consequence '' of its semantics .
a deduction is speech logos in which certain things having been supposed something different from those supposed results of necessity because of their being so .
of course this is purely conjecture and i do n't even know that aristotle would have even had the linguistic tools to make such a distinction .
i 've made it clear that if it 's ambiguous i will not count it .

i think this will be different depending on where people live .
for me it would be provincial city and then country .
i could move out of my city not happily but i would never leave this province .
while i would n't want to live in any other country the way of life and values held in western canada is very different than that of eastern canada just look at the difference in voting between the two .
so overall i have more of a sense of allegiance towards others in this province than i do towards other canadians in general .
not that i have anything against people who do n't come from this province !
just give me a second to pull out the nmts

apparently in georgia for murder there must be malice aforethought '' .
so they may have to prove that these guys went into this situation intending to kill him but that 's not necessarily the case .
a a person commits the offense of murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought either express or implied causes the death of another human being .
b express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take the life of another human being which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof .
malice shall be implied where no considerable provocation appears and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart .

this is what will change me and make me see that sexualizing children is bad . ''
and you do n't need to spread awareness of what she 's doing she 's doing it right out in the open very publicly on multiple social media platforms .
i know there 's no rule here against it i 'm just stating my opinionn getting overly involved in caro 's life like this is exactly what she wants in order to prove that her snarkers are obsessed and actively interfering with her life .
and when we do things like this ... maybe she 's not wrong .

a coworker confirmed that they changed minimum to 20v20 yesterday .
however warm-up duration change will come with next patch .
i think a 15 minute warm-up is going to really upset people if the server crashes a few minutes after the warm-up ends .
i really do n't think anything is going to help siege until the servers stop crashing so often .
there have been siege related server crash fixes in 1.3.1 patch .
i am not familiar with game-server side much to comment on current work distribution unfortunately but we gather logs from servers so i am guessing relevant people are checking those .
a longer warm-up might be good if anyone who joins the queue is put into the game during it .
i have noticed an odd thing with the warm-ups though sometimes it will seem like the player count stays the same throughout the warm-up period and then suddenly a bunch of people join once the game starts .
i once saw a siege stay at 60 players throughout warm-up and then suddenly grow to 120 once the warm-up was over .
as far as i know there is nothing that would prevent assigning more players during warm-up .
lobby side does n't even know if the game is still in warm-up or not .
however i talked with one of my coworkers and confirmed that a configuration we use to prevent partial scheduling players to games were enabled for siege .
i do not know why it was enabled as our team lead is currently on leave but we disabled it and will be following servers closely .
on this concept helmet they are just straight down and pointed as opposed to the real helmets that have more curves in the stripes .
on the real helmets the stripes are also very different thicknesses as opposed to this which makes them all about the same thickness .

i think it 's bogus for any teacher to add more work just because .
my school and district have actually instructed us not to make our workloads too overwhelming .
we 're stressed as well because we 're given 19 different directives and have to be held accountable for what we are doing as well .

think about it if you purely paid for access to it first it 'd cost a lot less than it does now .
it 's up-marked to make a profit out of the labor .
otherwise they 'd just release it at once and be done with it .

you 've got a pretty vast knowledge gap in how paying for goods and services works and it shows man .

are you looking for externship credit or just something to dump on your resume ?
at any rate should n't your school 's careers office be your first call ?
i 'm not able to help especially since i 'm in san francisco sorry but i can offer advice .
in your position if the school ca n't help i 'd be emailing/phoning around to pretty much everywhere that offers externships as you just know that some students were n't able or did n't want to travel to miami to take them up .
you might also try non-profits working in any subject area you have any sort of interest in as they can probably onboard you a lot faster .
personally as a construction guy my first calls would be to whoever 's running the legal at naiop miami dda miami-dade etc .
being an attorney especially in a market like miami often requires an enormous amount of hustling and this is a relatively minor challenge as there 's someone out there who will take free labor from you .
i believe homebridge-dafang has an older version of camera-ffmpeg baked in so that might need updating .
alternatively i wonder if you can skip the camera definition of homebridge-dafang and only expose the sensors and still setup your cameras using camera-ffmpeg .
i 've actually had both homebridge-dafang camera-ffmpeg running concurrently inthe past and elected to keep the dafang camera because then i 'd get the rich notifications with the snapshot .

i 'd actually say google is at fault here for not trying to adopt aptx low latency since most android phones do use that codec .
it allows for much lower latency and compensates for audio delay for games much better than aac or regular aptx .
it just baffles me that some cheap 50 wireless earbuds can adopt this tech or create their own iteration that works with their eco-system but google ca n't .

none of them appeal to me at all apart from maybe a reverso but it 's not that often i need a dress watch and luckily the explorer does quite well there too .
i do appreciate the ingenuity of some of the more complex pieces like mechanical perpetual calendars or even the gs spring drive but none of them have a design/style that appeals to me more than this does .

it 's when you do something to a character or choose an option but then feel the sting later and you 're like yeeeeah that was n't really consistent .
there 's been like 3 times where i just abandoned a playthrough because i started doing really ooc decisions for whatever reason .
generally for me it helps just writing a bit about a character i want to play as like a page or two on their personality/background though not always .

i edited my post because the initial temperature recommendation was n't displaying correctly for me .
do n't use any automated temp control stuff get a thermometer and ride the dial yourself when setting your mash temp .
figure out how much temperature you actually lose when adding your grains i never lose as much as the temp calculators say i should and how quickly your system responds to changes in temperature .
60 minute mash is probably fine for pretty much everything .

even if you change the 7 and the 3 to an arbitrary number you can never get this to work out exactly .
if you add up any numbers xx and yy in base b you get x y b x y .
you can call that new number z b z .
this is 99 in base 10 77 in base 8 ff in base 16 and so on .
then you get b b b which is always 110 no matter which base you choose .
however the larger the number you choose for b the closer b b 1 gets to just b b .
so asymptotically as your base approaches infinity the equation will work .

not gon na lie i liked making more money doing nothing and it almost felt like a summer vacation .
it was great and i got to play video games and work out all the time .
one thing i didnt get to do was play yugioh though .

i know they 're getting more support in rotd but i doubt locals will start before then anyway .
hope everyone is doing well except the guy who came up with dragun .
hope he has his exodia thrown into the ocean .
when doubt appears always let go and let god .
at moments of doubt when we truly feel helpless that is when surrender is simple you remove all expectations from yourself forgive the doubt for appearing and simply let life unfold as it is unfolding do not resist it and it 'll dissolve naturallythat time in which you doubt yourself be forgiving but understand you are not the doubt .
the doubt is trying to attack you and make you feel worse about yourself it makes you feel almost hopeless .
that is not true and you can simply put no expectations on yourself whatsoever in this moment and let the doubt be knowing full well you have faith that you are the loving source of the universe .
doubt may appear but it will not shake you the thought can be lost in its head but i know i am not that which is lost i am that in which it all appears .
when the ego knows it is in danger and is bound to disappear it does its most to bring you back into being a person instead of presence but there is nothing that can stop you .
you are that higher force and it is not going to abandon you because you are it .
it truly is beyond whatever you think jesus will save that soul of yours .
i recommend you reading some of my other posts about the truth .
these are thoughts that have been appearing in the vast consciousness that you are but it is not yourself and it is not true .
god is inevitably within you you are one with god whether you want it to not .
the only thing that can block that clear seeing is believing the thoughts and the content appearing within you .
you must realize that this is merely a thought and that thought has no meaning no substance and no power the only reason it appears to be true is because you are giving it the power of your belief .
whatever you believe will appear true so you must understand this and not give away your power to any content that appears within you .
instead of believing in all the content believe in the consciousness in which they appear .
the content which appears within yourself is not consistent not reliable it changes all the time you ca n't trust it .
you ca n't trust the mind you ca n't trust thoughts emotions and sensations .
the only thing you can truly trust is yourself consciousness for it is the only ever-present thing in life .
you must see this and understand there is no other place to put your faith in .
do not waste your time believing thoughts about you being confused do not take them as truth .
that which does not feel aligned is not yourself .
you are ever-presently aligned you ca n't not be aligned .
you are life and the witness of life you are inevitably aligned there is nothing you can do to disturb or disrupt the alignment .
that feeling which appears within the consciousness that you are is merely a feeling .
like thoughts feelings and sensations all appear within the consciousness that you are .
you are not that feeling and you are not the content of the feeling the feeling merely is being perceived within you .
anything that is perceived within you is not you for you are that empty space and openness that enables all experience to appear including the world thoughts emotions sensations imagination etc .
you are not any of it you are that absolute emptiness that allows everything to appear .
if there is a feeling that you are not aligned you must simply realize that you are not that feeling and that feeling says nothing about you or about alignment .
feelings by themselves do n't mean anything at all they have no substance they are empty of meaning it is only when you believe these feelings that they gain power and then they can feel true '' but if you simply do n't believe it and see it for what it is merely a feeling appearing within the vastness of yourself it will be observed and dissolve into the emptiness .
it is only when you believe that feeling that you hold on to it you try resist it you do n't want it there it is only then that the feeling truly feels real otherwise it simply comes and goes .
when you believe it to be real it stays longer than it should .
simply be aware that something is ever-presently perceiving all thoughts emotions and sensations .
stay in that peace rest in that peace move in that peace do not listen to merely thoughts sensations and emotions/feelings that appear within what you are .
the only thing you should listen to is silence for in silence the intuition can be heard and the intuition will guide you wherever you need to go .
you say my life is a mess and so is my mind '' realize that this is merely a thought appearing within the vast consciousness that you are .
you are not that thought it is not true about you .
you are that which perceives all thought emotion and sensations .
what happens when we believe these thoughts to be us is we give them the power of our belief .
so you say i am lost and idk what to do '' and if you believe this thought it will truly appear as if you are lost and do n't know what to do .
luckily the compass of life is always within you and it is your own heart and your own ever-present truth of being .
there is no conceptual knowledge or information that you need for any information or knowledge appear within the consciousness that you are .
that consciousness that you are is all-knowing and it is able to know anything it needs to know in the present moment .
to connect with what you truly are you must be able to realize that there is a presence that is aware of thoughts otherwise you would n't be able to tell me about these thoughts .
now that presence which is ever-presently perceiving all thought emotion and sensation can also be perceived .
so most importantly you need to understand that we thoughts appear within you but alone they are useless they are just thoughts they have no power not meaning and no substance .
it is only when you choose to believe these thoughts that they appear true .
literally stop believing these thoughts have power and are true and they will dissolve into the empty silence that you are .
to be able to navigate through this life all you must do is follow the silence of your own heart .
expect nothing at all from life do not put any expectations on it do not expect to have different thoughts do not expect to have different emotions or sensation .
whatever appears within you let it be know you are not that but that in which it is perceived .
you are the power of life and the witness of life .
know this and follow the path of ego-dissolution come into the silence of being and move in it move in that silence trust it treasure it fall in love with it .
you must see your self who you think you are as an illusion .
who you think you are is just a thought .
you are not depressed and you are not anxious this is who you think you are and because you believe it it appears to be real .
you ca n't be depressed nor anxious for you are the consciousness in which both depression and anxiety appear thought emotion and sensations all appear within the consciousness that you are .
you must be able to realize this understand this and live this truth it truly is like that .

please feel free to down vote whole heartedly this comment but to my defence it should be noted that it is meant humorously otherwise known as a joke albeit not a particularly good or funny one but still a joke maybe just a dad joke and not a full blown total joke .

i used to feel pain though 1 and 2 years ago and i thought i was getting taller but nothing happened .
in fact because if placebo effect i thought i got taller but when i measured i was not .
but it 's true that this year i had a lot headache and weight gain .
in fact this year my face got more masculine specially my jaw so maybe something could go on about my height as well haha .
but yeah i had some jaw click and pain btw
the seed is 12 words not a string of random letters .
the advantage of discovery is that it 's tankier the advantage of spire is that it manages weapon power better so given that they 're going in such different directions it 's pretty build specific .
and both of them are available in singularity core form so i would assume those would be the best options there as well .
no wonder people call you the weird kid at school .
after laughing at all the comments here i got ta seriously ask why alot of military guys still go after the same insane karen type or slut that every other guy 's been in even after they 've seen the red flags ?
is it really so that you can get some and it happens to come easier than paying a prostitute ?
what is so damn attractive about these types of women ? ? ?
i watch guys make this same mistake over and over again even if they 've got a failed marriage with kids or several ex-girlfriends who pulled the same shit .
hey in the same situation which country are you in ?
gtav online disconnects me all the time on xbox .

ah ok cool i thought 10mg was pretty high .
im meant to take 2mg in morming and 5mg at night but i just take it all at night .

i imagine that ferrari would be keen to give one of their f2 drivers an alfa romeo seat which they could fill quite nicely for two years but this would leave giovinazzi out unless kimi retired .
on the other hand with ferrari considering an indycar effort that might present a new avenue for one or two of the fda drivers to go down ...

i 'm running a iphone 8 plus not interested in upgrading or moving to a newer device .
in such a great position being on 13.3 with unc0ver and being able to use checkra1n also as i also have a a11 chip .
i feel tweaks and being jailbroken gives years more life to a older device and beats anything that apple offers software wise for years to come .
yeah the hardware would be great to have but i base all my purchases now-based on jailbreak availability now .
so your not alone most would say oh why do n't you use android if you want to have a open sourced system ?
i wish i could in some cases but having a s5 apple watch and airpods and a macbook pro and being invested prevents that as one example .
the other example is that jailbreaking is n't the same from my understanding as owning an android and has a different atheistic to it when you jailbreak with which ever tool you use to adding repos in your package manager of choice to trying and experimenting with tweaks and making friends with others who have the same interest and passion as you as well as supporting tweak developers beta testing new tweaks and joining discord communities it 's like a whole new world .
so i just found out that kuva bramma might be a good weapon against mobs but it sucks against stalker even with a ms and cc riven .

case in point i have a friend getting into warhammer .
they were a firm secondary who read novels and played some videogames .
they knew i played a lot of tabletop games and asked what the factions were like in 40k .
they thing that actually shocked them was the very basic fact that the imperium of mankind is garbage and destined for failure .
they thought from the outside looking in it was something like halo with a gothic aesthetic .
proud armoured superwarriors fighting alien threats to keep humanity safe .
the imperium is a galactic scale civilisation '' where to be a man is to be an insignificance in untold trillions '' and often they will just lose entire solar systems in bureaucratic white noise throw a billion human soldiers at a ork infested world just to look good for morale on the whole and that is usually what people think is the 'grim darkness of the far future ' .
people by and large are illiterate uneducated serfs less intelligent than the dumbest medieval peasant .
speaking a garbled gutterspeak version of a french-latin hybrid that is barely constant between hive cities let alone worlds .
humans are often born en masse from genevats and born purely to be workforce or military fodder reading is an act of ancient mysticism people more often than not are unknowingly fed on corpse starch '' made from ground up humans yes the imperium is an entire civilisation based on cannibalism by necessity and invention creativity and problem solving is reserved entirely for military activity .
to create something new is heresy and the idea of making something is as alien as hugging an ork in terms of ideas .
its a society running on fumes keeping whatever leftovers from their golden age running often through trial and error rather than intelligence education and craftsmanship .
with many things based on ancient standard template constructs '' that tell them how to make medicine housing weapons and the like and these files can get corrupted and just stop working so the martian adeptus mechanicus often send out archeological questors '' to find pristine copies left on lost worlds .
in fact they recently introduced a new mary sue character whos great crime is 'innovation ' and making new things and working with aliens which of course lead to new lines of hover tanks and super space marines to buy models of wise consumer !
its so bad that recently one of the primarchs the genentic founding father of the flagship ultramarines woke from a 10,000 year coma and was horrified at the disgusting inbred ignorant nightmare culture humanity had degenerated to that treated him like the son of a literal god had church worlds '' and torture flagellants and religion as law is the norm in a society he last saw as entirely atheist unifying people the emperor was only keeping somewhat ignorant lest they learn about chaos which of course they did and shit went arse up during the horus heresy .
compounding this idiot kingdom is the idea of anything of 'the other ' being something that needs destroying .
find a world where humanity splintered off 34,000 years ago and the different planet with different enviromental dietary and gravimetric factors lead to a species thats 7 feet tall with bone white skin and purple hair and eyes ?
well its time to call down the inquisition to decide if they should be genocided or made into a slave sub race .
they dont agree with the facist nightmare mankind has become ?
theres some good planets full of raw material here that needs cleaning .
its a setting where humanity is only chugging along through shear numbers but the average human today is far stronger healthier intelligent and well educated than most nobles in the imperium of man .
if you removed all external threats like the tyranids orks necrons and so on they still have no happy ending because they are technically a post apocalyptic society that thinks they are the apex of human society .
after explaining it they decided to go with the genestealer cult instead of imperials .
it made me think of settings in stuff i like like dark souls where 'saving the world ' is n't really a thing .
your victories are short lived attempts to hold back the day the lights go off and the chairs are all put on the tables but its never you defeated the reapers and the galaxy is safe '' its you beat the bosses and either end everything on your terms or you kept this terminal patient alive to drag along in a semblance of living for a little bit longer .
see also diablo nier anything where the end state situation for the setting is extinction not how but when .
or does it add this overarching nihilistic sense of things being to pointless to get invested in them ?
i started doing my first re-read today and in the prologue szeth points out that the statue of shalash is missing from the statues of the heralds .
do we know if this is significant yet what the significance is ?
youtube seems damn near impossible to contact any form of a human being involved in the site .
i 'm not interested in releasing exploits and all that stuff i really do n't mind just telling a youtube admin so they can fix it because the exploit itself is kind of stupid and requires you to rent movies anyways .
i know there is a point of no return where you will build !
a teleporter to get inside institute faction quest ! but how far per faction quest can i go if i just waltz into the main game and ! kill father then blowing up the institute .
! i just want this to get over with so i can finally play the dlc
i do n't really have any core ideas i just think it would be a nice setting that is rarely used for video games .
like if you have a store you could make food cost a billion marks .
or you could show the political turmoil of the country and try to make sure hitler does n't get elected .
you could also play as the freikorp putting down communist uprisings and vice versa .
anyways that concludes my rant about how many video games could be made about post wwi germany .
what the fuck am i supposed to do at this point .
i hate the body i 'm in and i have hated it for years on end .
my depression prevents healthy relationships and my insecurities means i ca n't even fucking live my life .
i do n't even want to look in the mirror i do n't even want to be in bright lights that are brighter than a fucking night light .
i feel disgusting my life is wasting and i 'm just here for the fucking ride .
i have so many skin issues and doctors do n't seem to give a shit neither does my dermatologist .
i ca n't be loved i ca n't love myself .
what the fuck is the point of all this .
but i experience a lot of symptoms of bipolar ii ? .
this last month i discovered i still had 1,000 in an old bank account and since it was n't my main bank account i convinced myself it was fine to blow it all on clothes and shit for my new apartment .
this last week i was in such a good mood and felt so ambitious and goal oriented and good .
i was fine and had plans to accomplish 3 tasks that day and was dead set on it one of which was laundry and my apartment 's machine took my quarters and did n't work .
i lost my mind and got so mad and punched it a few times .
i am rarely ever angry and almost never get upset .
i 'm having unfounded doubts about a new relationship i was previously excited about .
like i do n't know what i 'm upset about i just am .
they 've done nothing wrong.they recently expressed a desire to be official which i wanted and do still want but the idea does n't excite me anymore and instantly made me feel unhappy and idk why .
last week i was considering asking her myself now idk .
yesterday i went for a run in town a half hour from mine .
forgot that i was n't in my own town for a second but remembered .
then used a snap filter and got confused a second time because i saw a filter for the kc royals and was like weird there 'd be a kc filter in south dakota '' which is where i moved from last year .
i live in kansas city now and for a moment forgot apparently .
idk if dissociating a is a symptom of bp .
i 'm irritable and unhappy and having doubts about everything .
idk what happened.maybe its just depression but the change was just so drastic .
i 've had the highs and lows before but the irritability is newish .
is there any videos or anything with the best tech etc for each type of ship and where to place them in your inventory ?
it has been a few days now that control is n't available .
does anyone know when the issue will be resolved ?
many of us probably benefited form the epic sale .
i 've already played the game and now bought the dlc .
for anyone who has n't played it yet go purchase it it 's good fun .
my friend let 's name her rose wants to meet up for a chat because she is having some technical problems .
she suggested going to our friend jen to visit her too at the same time .
i told her it would be hard to social distance if we are inside her apartment .
i suggested meeting halfway to a park and walk along the river while discussing her problem .
she said she does not want to take the bus due to corona .
i should according to her just travel to her place total 1 hour travel 2 busses and then we take a walk on the forest near her .
you are willing to take the bus to meet with our other friend and even be inside her apartment but when i suggested she meets me halfway in a park she wo n't do it ?
i am the very helpful kind of friend the one who in the end gets treated like a doormat .
i want to stop being too nice but i ca n't help it sometimes it 's just my nature .
in the end i told her i am too lazy to travel so far and that too bad i do n't have a car .
she messaged me last night about her problem and i still did not reply to her .
no seriously what 's up with all the noise .
i 'm on a side street off communipaw near lsp .
check your final receipts for produce that goes by weight .
i got 4 cabbages recently green nappa red savoy all regular shape and size around 3lbs .
the receipt listed them as 8 to 12 pounds each .
just one nappa cabbage ended up 19 bucks a piece ...
does anyone here have experience with requesting and being granted academic concession ?
i applied for an aegrotat grading in one course as of may 8th and have yet to be contacted with a decision .
i 'm worried with the covid spring term academic drop due date coming up soon that i might have to drop the course before i even get a response solely so i do n't get stuck with a d .
any advice experience or info i 'm missing out there ?
it 's obvious that i should be using methods for calling all of the repetitive code but with 9 separate jbutton objects i 'm not seeing how to accomplish this .
i know i can pass in a jbutton object into a method but i will still have to make 9 separate calls to that method correct ?
oh i realize there are a ton of issues with this .
there 's no real logic in cputurn yet and i have n't figured out how to reset the game properly yet .
for now i am just trying to make things more manageable as they are getting out of hand .
looking to buy one of the mattresses in the title .
the mattress would be for myself and my wife .
i 'm a combination sleeper mainly on my stomach .
to help with the intervals in day 4 i find this excercise beneficial for glueing the gaps together .
if you can deploy the f trigger half way down and try to keep the pitch .
gliss up and down the harmonics and try not to puff your cheeks or shift the embouchure too much .
like jeez so what i where shoes in my house it 's not disgusting it 's not unsanitary jesus fucking christ its not like ima fuckin die because i brought my shoes more than three feet into my house i wear fucking boots that are a pain in the ass to to get back on after they come off it 's my house and i have the freedom to do whatever i want to do in it so stop criticizing me for something i like to do in my house on my own time that does n't even effect you !
just a quick question about if anyone knows whether the development team has mentioned a switch port at all ?
i 've got a pretty solid build just of out curiosity what parts do you think i 'll be needing to upgrade first and when ?
i made a wiki page called the cedb or the coaster enthusiasts database to talk about coaster enthuiasts especialy mr blobby
i 'm a diehard miami dolphins fan runs in the family .
however i recently moved to sc about 1 hour from charlotte so of course i immediately bought season tickets for the panthers because i really like watching some of the players like mccaffrey teddy dj moore and samuels .
plus i ca n't pass up getting the ability to watch drew brees matt ryan and tom brady .
besides some of the players though i really know nothing about the org .
i know new coach but that 's really about it .
i 'm going to be hopefully attending all 10 games 2 preseason and i want to really know everything about the panthers !
what 's your confidence in the direction of the team ?
if you take the time to reply then thank you !
as an update there was one night where i had an absolute meltdown and she was actually my mom for a minute .
someone i could confide in and she acted like the mom i used to know .
so i have it as a personal policy to not talk about politics as i am the black sheep in my family .
i go against what they think is normal and true .
so my country not usa is advising that people wear masks of any kind when they ca n't social distance as we are reopening .
it is a scary time for everyone and now people think because we are reopening that we do n't need masks .
last weekend there were way too many people without masks who should 've had them .
anyway i mention this to lunatic linda as o made a bunch up for anyone who wanted them .
i offered her some and she came up with a turkey outlandish concept
doctors and nurses say that face masks are worse than covid because you 're breathing in your own co2 .
then she said she will never get the vaccine because they 're going to put microchips in us .
i told her that was an outright lie and they were considering a due but it has n't happened .
then she said well o have n't gotten the flu in years and have n't gotten the flu shot .
what i wanted to say is that for the past five years you have n't lived with anyone and your daughter me had the flu a lot i 'm high school .
and now the workplace because i work with people and kids .
i also wanted to say that she will never see my kids until she gets the vaccine she needs or they start school but i do n't want to start a fight not today .
right now i click share make sure i 'm connected to my wifi click click save then go to my pc click x5 and that is frankly a lot of work .
i run a m team us h and i main mistweaver holy paladin .
we run keys ranging from helping alts at lower levels 9 and our main team running 15 's .
we currently have two tanks but ca n't get on too often so we would love the help of a few more .

my bnet is addy 11219 and disc is addy 3589
my partner m 27 and i f 25 have been together for about 8 years and we do plan to get married eventually however he says that he does n't want kids because he does n't want to bring a child into this shitty world that we live in as the kid did not ask to be born '' .
as for me i really want to have a kid and it honestly sucks to know that he does n't and i do n't know what to do because he seems to be so sure of what he wants and i 'm not sure on what to do about this .
as the title suggests i can not see the keys in the helper when pressing super+s .
i have moved the key shortcuts to a globals keys file the bindings work but no keys just the letters and the descriptions .
also why is there tmux shortcuts in the helper i dont have tmux installed how can i remove it ?
i 'm looking for an inexpensive victorinox boning knife and need help figuring out what style to get .
it will primarily be used to skin chicken thighs but also general poultry boning .
3 '' 3.75 '' and 4 '' poultry boning knives
5 '' and 6 '' boning knives with straight or curved blades .
each size and style is available with flexible semi-flexible semi-stiff and stiff blades .
can someone point me in the right direction as to which style would be most appropriate to skin chicken ?
what was the buying power of spanish real in late 17th early 18th century ?
how much a loaf of bread could cost in reals ?
how many reals in form of pieces of eight or any other coin did an average european/new spain town citizen need to sustain himself for one month ?
there are also some secondary questions but they are n't as essential to me as the previous ones
how much a ship an armed merchantman could cost in reals ?
how much a sword simple one could cost in reals ?
how much a smoothbore gun could cost in reals ?
i dont overpay you in any case looking for profit not for your skin
i keep on trying to join the jmpoint.hu dating website but the moderator of the site keeps on repeatedly rejecting my dating profile even though i keep on signing up for the site using various different email addresses but still my dating profile is reject each and every time so that 's why i would love it if one of you guys could personally hack the site and approve my dating profile for me .
to me personally the order-tide is actually a good thing .
i enjoy playing greenskin norsca and dark elves and all three get something challenging and interesting out of the order factions advantages with the ai .
ca should consider implementing customizable buffers to individual races in difficulty selection .
give players the option of enhancing individual races and players then get to decide which factions are favored on each individual campaign and who they want to fight .
hearts of iron 4 currently has individual difficulty sliders for the great powers which works really well .
give players the option to buff naggaroth in their tyrion campaign and they can the head-to-head they always wanted .
a simple solution would be to set a default campaign and battle difficulty and then decide some of the factions either have higher or lower difficulty settings .
example you play a campaign on normal/normal but you are playing tyrion so you set malekith to hard/hard .
i met my daddy few months back ... at first i did n't want him to be my daddy but after much discussion i agree for him to be my dd ...
we set up some rules that both of us are okay with..whereby 1 of them needs me to send him selfies every week ... im a very shy person so i dont really accept the ideas of it but he is okay for me to get comfortable with .
so.. heres the story due to the current lockdown we are unable to meet up often mostly im going over to look for him but every time we met it was always something sexual and its always in enclosed public places
everytime when i had my meals i would take a picture for him so that he knows that im eating well ...
but everytime when i ask him what he had or did he had his meals he would just reply in texts which i often hope that he could send me a picture of what he eats..
there was once where he reply me fc and i didnt know what it was so i asked him he reply me fish chips la .. so i was kinda upset when i see that he reply me in such a way which i didnt know where did i do wrong ... all i wanted was to know what is he having and he reply in such a mean way !
he always did n't update me what was he doing so there was once where i was spamming him in chats and i asked him what was he doing ?
and since he didnt reply me while he was online so i just spam him a few messages and all i get from him was that he was gaming with a ... and it gets me into my head that i should n't be so clingy to him since his reply is so mean and its making me upset ...
he always seems to like to avoid/change topics of questions that im asking him..which always make me feel that he is hiding something ... but i couldnt understand and its like so weird for me ... when im asking what is he doing he will mostly just ignore it ...
i even told him that im not going to text alot anymore since he is always so angry and he says that it due to him didnt have sex enough that he is feeling angry ... fyi i didnt have sex with him yet though and yet i cant even make him happy by giving him sexy photos.. im not really liking it i did told him he feel annoyed .
since my ddlg lifestyle is a private stuff for me and im not living alone so i dont really have private spaces .
so far im feeling that he doesnt love me enough as a little .
he always told me that he needs to do so much for me make sure i eat properly drink enough water wash up and sleep before certain timing which he didnt really make sure for me to do so but i cant even send him sexy photo to make him feel happy .
i did try to send him some which i try to make myself do it just for him
but all i feel from him is that he only want to use me for his sexual needs and doesnt really love me as a little since he is always telling me that he wants to me backdoor ... . am i really nothing to him ? !
edit we have been on cold wars these few days and i dont even know whether is he giving up on this r/s since we arent talking much like we used to ...
i used to think that even before we get together he used to be damn clingy and really nice to me which make me feels that he cares and are really interested..
but once we get together things has been different .
he is not so clingy to me anymore like he used to and so much things has happened ...
i understand fine but do you i sid link me with some because i have done exactly what you have said and no false bans have some up .

2 it 's kyle busch who accidentally caused it .

stuff like this happens almost every race weekend but because it 's kyle and chase people make suddenly a whole drama out of it .
this means the mother has to wake up every 2hrs to feed the baby then put them back to sleep .
until their stomachs are big enough to hold more food .
do you have any idea just how sleep deprived this makes you ?
do you understand that anyone would hallucinate under these conditions ?
this is not a chemical imbalance and if it is its only a temporary one due to lack of sleep .
their baby is only 3 months old they have a long way to go of this ... medication would be dangerous for the mother .
do n't trust doctors they are getting paid to push pills on you .
umm yea so does every fucking mother of a newborn .

bruv there 's plenty of legitimate concerns with vanguard no need to lie and call it something it is not .
when you use that to argue with liteupthatskyes post about our lack of testing it comes off as malicious .

there have been several games which were sold on the epic games store for a while before they were given away for free .

no such thing with chinese workers just ask italy .
everyone has to start somewhere and most people on here probably started with one or two books 📖 .
you need to finish pof for griffon and you need lws4 for skyscale .
for skyscale you could just do the last lws4 chapter to get started but you will still need to collect currency from all lws4 maps so might as well do them all .

i 'm not trying to call you out or anything i just am wondering if there is a specific benefit to visiting a 5 star island other than it looking really nice
i will try it hahahaha strong memes are the best kind of memes
so solid and still holds his on at this stage .
consider the situation that it puts the person being arrested in .
they 're woken up from a loud noise in the middle of the night .
even if the police announce themselves you 're likely not actually going to process that it happened .
it 's a situation where it makes some sense theoretically but only in the most narrow circumstances .
for non-violent drug offenses which is where we most often hear of them being used it really does n't make any sense other than the department trying to justify their swat budget .
also given that police have qualified immunity they just do n't have the incentives to get things right .
game score is basically a per approximation it should n't be playing second fiddle to bpm in the title and in the data sort .
bpm has sound statistical methods and evidence behind it while game score does not .
i have two races in my unnamed fantasy world that i quite like them being the ironborne and the primordials .
for now the primordials are basically my version of orcs .
they are large muscular race with an instinctual hatred of the other sapient beings and wish to make them extinct .
all life in this world was descended from the tyrants immense beasts that once ruled the planet and hunted each other to vie for total supremacy .
eventually they hunted each other into extinction and when their blood spilled it sank into the earth and flowed into the waters planting the seeds for new life to bloom .
the primordials were one of the first and they carried on the need for supremacy but with more of a pack mentality .
thus they rose armies to annihilate the other races born from their ancestors .
however they were eventually thwarted but still cause issues for the other races in a desperate attempt to achieve supremacy .
the ironborne are alien creatures who constructed a magic gateway from their world to the other .
although they appear very brutish and menacing the ironborne are ancient creatures holding much wisdom both in peace and war .
their homeworld is named valln and it is massive most notably filled to the brim with anomalous events and creatures the ironborne being one of those .
although things were unsteady with diplomacy at first the ironborne are now walking among the other races and even have their own capital city established in the world they have just set foot on .
i do n't think you 'd get banned again .

rome was n't democratic in the slightest it was an oligarchy in which a select group of families owned most of the land and held all of the power in the senate .
almost everything stemmed from land ownership and military might the latter of which grew more important until august founded his empire on the principle of might and took all of egypt for himself to make certain he 'd have plenty of land as well .
also virtually every non-tribal state had a constitution and even tribes had certain unwritten rules that were followed .
rome 's democracy '' consisted of the citizens of the city of rome alone holding all the cards until their italian allies '' tributaries in all but name revolted and nearly defeated them in 88 b.c .
it took until 212 for people outside of rome to be given the same rights and cities had to suck up to rome if they wanted to be given proper rights .
2. aside from everything else you said that 's wrong are you seriously saying rome was n't a corrupt empire built on the backs of slaves ?
lack of slaves from conquest is one of the reasons the empire started its decay along with corruption leeching its economy and draining the middle class for all they were worth .
the romans took apart entire civilizations in the making in their conquests of gaul spain and england settling their veterans in new cities to make certain the regions were properly romanized the imperial cult could be enforced and taxes would keep coming .
they literally stationed men from local tribes on the other side of the world to make certain local rebellions were all but impossible .
only in the past few decades are we starting to see the amount of cultures and local developments that were lost because of the roman conquests .
so tl dr rauatai is exactly like rome as rome was a pretty shitty place to be if you were n't a roman citizen like 98 of the population in the empire before 88 b.c. the imperial cult was enforced across the empire militarism made certain revolts were impossible and local military forces were displaced and there 's plenty of corruption .
so yes rome is a perfect comparison for rauatai .

another thing that really bothers me is that having a conversation about veganism is somehow pushing your beliefs on others but vegans being bombarded by ads for meat everywhere we go and having to watch everyone around us eat it is fine .

from experience it 's common for a lot of people to get anxious about interviews and although you may react more intensely i would n't say it 's the end of the game for you .
one of the best pieces of advice i received was actually from a drama major and they suggested using role-playing as a way for me to get out of my head and remove to an extent the cause of my anxiety which for me was the uncertainty of how the interview will go .
mock interviews practicing with friends in front of the mirror all of these helped build up my confidence to speak about my skills and experience .
i 've been where you are and i too was able to get a job .

i know that 's from the quote about cutting off your own hand but what i 'm trying to say is if you were to give up one or both of your eyes would you enter heaven without them ?
because if so then those lines in matthew would mean that people would be entering heaven mamed or blind .

liberalism is an analysis of class and community in societies where there are monarchs or another form of aristocracy that have control of the economy .
then an argument that those who are exploited under this hierarchy should be emancipated through democratisation and individual freedom .
the problem is that through liberalism you do not get rid of the crown .
only shatter it in to splinters each taking control of their own part of the economy .
in this splintered micro kingdoms the same issues arise .
these arguments are just generalised and evolve in to socialism .
socialists believe in individual freedom too but they appreciate that if only a handful of people have the agency then they are unlikely to have agency either .
everybody must have some amount of agency over their own lives to have individual freedom and that 's where the desire for economic democracy comes from .
at least at the level of the worker but with room for democratic consumption as well .
and that 's not to say it 's bad .
they just did n't have the lived experiences of liberal humanists in the 1800s that saw the dickensian outcomes .
those liberal humanists that did see those outcomes moved on however .
they did n't just want to democratise politics but also democratise the economy .
the numbers just get astronomical and you just accept the things you can not change 😪😪

you can put the surface flames out but the fire can smolder deeply for years .
one day at a time a daily reprieve contingent upon the maintenance of our spiritual condition .
all of these sayings with the addition of the idea that alcohol is cunning baffling powerful all reinforce the idea that if alcoholism gets loose the outcomes can be unpredictable .
the best answer is probably maybe depending on his decisions.
myself i was sober in aa for 16 years and returned to drink .
like most i quickly resumed the same drinking pattern that i had prior to quitting alcohol .
for better or worse my pattern is periodic binging and with my pattern i could get by and hold my job together .
after 10 years of this i got just plain tired of the same old nonsense no respect from family isolation no plan so i walked back into aa .
in my case the peat bog fire still smolders but much deeper .
if i take steps to stay aware of the danger and to stay in touch with my gratitude for being free of bondage i will probably never drink again .
before an active alcoholic can make much sense of things the drink cycle must be broken .
in my case that is a bit tricky since i never drank continually and when the urge would pop up was a bit unpredictable so i had the learn about my warning signs .
but for someone who drinks a lot of alcohol daily a detox or rehab may be necessary the longer the stay the better .
remember that annual surveys by the cdc find that about 12 of the us adult population suffer from aud alcohol use disorder which translates into 15-18 million problem drinkers .
only about 1.5 million of us are active in aa .
there are other sobriety programs but statistics are difficult to come by so needless to say there are a lot more problem drinkers needing help than those getting help .
a guy i knew since he walked into aa about 8 years ago went back to his easy chair and bourbon on ice about 8 months ago .
he is financially self-sufficient but his health is n't great .
so far he has simply lost his desire to be sober .
i can do nothing about that but let him know that he is missed and the door is always open to welcome him back .
i hope that your dad will get lucky too .
i do n't have a lot of range time on this yet but i do shoot my 9mm and .45 often .

was looking for something similar to asoiaf for a long time tried sanderson wot abercrombie but nothing of it really fit .
i recently started first hobb trilogy and being close to finish the first tome i can say it is the first fantasy in a while that gaves me strong asoiaf feel .
still do n't know how it works out in the end it 's quite different from asoiaf in many ways but there is something they have in common when telling about nuanced and human characters and the atmosphere of the books itself the shroud of mystery around the world slowly uncovered in very small parts by the author and how cruel the world can be for main characters .
it goes much deeper into human emotions have deeper insights into life it has better prose .
even though i 'm just at the end of a 1st tome of 16 i already know why her books are so highly regarded .
although beware hobb seems to like her characters even less than martin ...
you might like also the first law by abercrombie which is a bit more brutal asoiaf like in terms of describing literally brutality and fights strongly hitting into grimdark imho to much but you should feel comfortable in this world after asoiaf .the witcher is also a good fit as it hits the same tones that asoiaf .
bare in mind all three are different than asoiaf .
if you search for the same scale and complexity detailed world realistic approach to characters and being still low on fantasy elements forget it .
all 3 are less complex on a lesser scale with smaller less detailed world and with lesser number of main characters .
but the stories and characters in those books are of very high quality .
in terms of scale and complexity a lot of people recommend wot but it takes more typical good vs evil fantasy story approach i 've only read 1 tome not eager to start with the 2 ... it 's in the opposite group than hobb after 1st book i have no idea how this can such a popular series .
there is also highly recommended malazan which seems to be quite different beast with story spanning thousands years or so and tones of characters which does n't look to be similar to the grounded focused asoiaf story .
sure captain america got stronger but loki is a frost giant who has shown more impressive feats and is still naturally stronger than cap even at his best then you take into account his magic daggers reaction time durability hulk smashed him repeatedly and he was up and walking later on so not sure if cap can even hurt him too much .
eventually cap should tire out and loki lands the finishing blow .
this is overkill tbh the only way cap has a chance is with mjolnir and since he does n't then loki got this .
i 'm in no way saying you 're wrong just i have never heard of staying in a building when it 's on fire .
i 'm curious as to where you heard this .
i 've always been told to evacuate in an orderly fashion always with a muster point to go to so they can check if everyone is out .
i wonder if you could ceramic coat it like they do with cars .
it 'll still scratch but should be more resilient than naked plastic .
definitely check it out man has jid miguel and 6lack as well .
oh so if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to hide ?

my friend said men acted different towards each other at that time and while that may be true he portrays them like he portrays male and female lovers just two men .

my dog has also an herniated disc and the vet advised against surgery too .
the first couple of months were rough on him and i had to make some adjustments in my house .
i got rid of my bed frame and now sleep on my mattress on the floor .
i 'm not a vet so i 'm just saying what my vet told me my dog is doing really good now and it 's been a couple of years but if your vet tells you or your parents otherwise you need to listen to them .
basically any movement similar to going up or down a step is going to be painful .
the first few months i had to be very strict with this .
no jumping or standing up no stairs even one step no hills and no physical exercise .
the vet recommended he spent most of the day in a crate my dog was not used to this and he got very anxious and restless so it was not helping because he was moving even more .
the sudden changes you mentioned could be because he overdid it or because he moved wrong '' .
after the meds did their thing he started to feel better and the vet told me i needed to keep taking the same precautions as before because even though he was not in that much pain anymore he was still not okay .
this was harder because he just wanted to jump around all over the place .
after that gradually the vet told me he could start going back to a normal '' life .
he was allowed to walk some steps if necessary he could play a little more energetically etc .
the pain comes back sometimes and after taking him to the vet a few times because of that they gave me some nsaid to help him and the vet told me it was not worth going back every time he was in pain unless of course it was needed you can tell he 's in a lot of pain or acting weird .
even thought hes doing so much better we basically had to adapt to some new thing .
he ca n't exercise much he can have small walks 10-15 min on flat terrain twice a week .
no jumping more than necessary no tricks involving jumping either .
if i see he 's in pain i immediately give him the medication .
he looooves tug of war but i have to be extra careful and do n't pull too much .
whatever you can do to help that step movement '' i mentioned .
i 'm sorry you and your dog are going through this .
remember it 'll take time for him to feel better and that he will never be completely pain free '' but you can do things to help him get as close to that as possible .
english is not my first language and i got emotional writing this sorry if some things do n't make sense
it 's not that expensive if you want to cheap out .
they drill a piece of metal to your leftover teeth parts make a paste that they color to match your coffee stained teeth color paint it onto your teeth parts it hardens with the help of a heater thing and boom you have some fake teeth .
i 'm sure this guy probably gets more expensive option than i did lol
but make sure to compile the equivalence of all the trash that manager put on your desk
ah i see i watched shiey 's youtube series and it looked similar .
i was learning a piece for like a month .
ya in the front and seemed to resolve mostly but not total .
vet thought it was partly his memory of the pain or anticipation that made it not disappear totally 🤷🏻‍♀️
because of the age and type of men she chooses .
she selects men who are not at her level .
i am not just talking about jesse or tom either

any recommendations on type of wood to use for an outdoor porch couch ?
i was thinking cedar 2x4 but was n't sure if it would look polished .
so there 's this song/beat reused three times in one of blackpanthaa 's older videos that since then 2015 i have n't been able to track down and i need help .
i tweeted out to him at the time and bp claimed in the description of each video i 'll be linking the music in the video was by klimbeats .
i emailed klimbeats one day and showed him the videos but he was confused because he said his music was n't playing in the background of any of the three videos anywhere and since then i have n't been able to get another response from bp here are the videos with the timestamps where the track i 'm looking for begins playing in the background

latest version of scan converter v1.2 with mac osx 10.1.5.4 https 10.1.5.4 .
it is not picking up my macbook 's webcam .
i met someone over the weekend that completely blew my mind .
as stale as this sounds i 'm usually very reserved and unimpressed by men and i rarely find people in my life very attractive beyond looks and confidence/superficial success .
i feel like i connected with this guy on another level i was able to express myself comfortably without feeling stifled in any way and vice versa .
i found everything he said to be so interesting and we gracefully jumped from subject to subject with the conversation never dying out or becoming boring .
i felt like i was existing at a higher frequency when i was with him .
he comes from an italian american immigrant family he 's an inspiring hard working self made man .
towards the end of the night he kept kissing my hands and telling me how pretty my nails were .
it was such an endearing gesture that no ones ever done to me before ... i 'll never forget it .
i have a gut feeling that he 's not looking for a serious relationship right now and that 's okay it 's probably not good timing for me either but i ca n't help thinking about the effect that he had on me .
i could actually see myself truly loving and spending my life with someone like him .
which is n't something i 've been able to envision with other men that i 've gone out with so needless to say i 'm a little shook .
is there anyone you 've come across that 's done this to you ?
i do n't have many girlfriends irl so i 'm turning to reddit for my girl talk .
i want to literally get this off of my chest so that i can forget about it and get back to my normal comfortable loveless life 😅

my fiancé has a cat m12 and i have small dog f4 we have recently moved in with each other .
my fiancé also has a daughter 4 who scared of the dark .
during the day the dog and cat are fine .
they do n't play might chase each other every now and again but really they just ignore each other .
at night the cat is free roaming around the apartment and the dog is in her cage in our bedroom .
we have to keep the door open for the child who is scared of the dark and have a few lights on .
the cat has gotten into the habit of making ungodly noises at night and runs around which in turn sets off the dog and keeps the kid awake .
we have tried sleeping with the door shut but between the child and the cat body slamming it while screaming .
so we decided to cover the dogs cage with a blanket to at least stop her from seeing what was going on which helped her calm down some but she still gets worked up though not as bad
we are running in very little sleep and any ideas would be welcome .

hi all i 'm in the market for a new monitor and want to go ultrawide but cant decide what to get .
im looking at either the lg 34gn850 aw3420dw or lg38wn95c depending on price in the uk found it here https www.lambda-tek.com/lg-38wn95c\~sh/b44359327 https www.lambda-tek.com/lg-38wn95c~sh/b44359327 for £1300 .
now i did buy an lg 34gk950f and was pleased with its size and colour accuracy but had to return it within a week as it started flickering randomly and it annoyed the living daylights out of me .

i know the alienware is only 120hz which coming from a 144hz panel i dont know if it will bother me that much looking for comments from people that have switched from 144hz to 120hz and what the experience is like .
i 've also seen quite a few posts on here and elsewhere of people having faulty 34gn850 's within weeks and also plenty of failures of 34gk950 's which makes me worry about the longevity of the panel and i know lg 's customer service leaves a lot to be desired something i dont want to have to deal with after warranty expires when im spending this much on a panel .
i 've only ever seen good things about the aw3420dw .

literally anyone could sell through amazon and they could be selling fakes .
however amazon themselves can sell the same product on the same exact listing with all the reviews about fakes '' and you 'll actually get a real product .
i understand where you 're coming from though i would argue the same precautions you take on ebay etc can be took on amazon as well since it seems as though both real and fake products can be found on both .

my boyfriend is very well-endowed so condoms that do n't turn his dick purple are hard to come by even xl magnums do n't cut it so i decided to start birth control so we did n't have to use them anymore do n't worry we got tested first and i know he would n't cheat because he does n't have the time or energy with me always around lol .
now we have the problem that i ca n't fit him inside me without extra lube and foreplay but at the end of the day it still better and safer than poorly fitting condoms .

there are areas in france called zone rouge https en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zone_rouge which are so eco-toxic from arsenic pollution today still that it 's impossible to live and grow food there .
and here 's the kicker these two things are leftovers from ww*1 .
i used to own some 20mm bullets probably fired by an aircraft that a local farmer plowed out of his field .
this https cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/198727228090089472/709519126233874445/qyjjkrx5t6y41.png german shell was found in a nearby field a couple weeks ago .
there goes his chance of be becoming president one day .
honestly the cuts and classic nature of them are so flattering on women of all shapes and size .
there was such style and a sense of decorum up until the late fifties .
honestly i ca n't wait to wear this thing .
i 'm pretty sure it was prevalent in movies back in the 1930 's 1950 's .
and i 've never heard come out with hour bare hands only come out with your hands up
oingo boingo artist never took my request to draw this scene .
btw if you ever find anything interesting studying the original languages we could use some more contributors at r/originalchristianity
ehh it 's fine they get colored tools and we get mods free skins free texture packs etc .
runelite is still top imo what everyone really still uses so not too much has changed
not working grey screen on boot tried everything i knew
i think its probably more to do with it being an image they lazily cut and pasted .
when i had my braces off my teeth felt so disturbingly smooth .
also love how this question makes it sound like glasses are as permanently attached as braces .
lag long ball spamming weird online experience ai favouring some players unreal passing unreal moment same like above
collected 7k coins only gon na open legends box if they ever arrived mainly for vieira/96 rated beckham .not gon na open any featured/im
because having a rated player by waisting coin then his performance get downgrade in online session due to scripting/lag does n't make it worth to have them and to grind for coin by playing those f cked up matchday matches .
for me currently having high rated featured/im player are like show-off .
due to this isolation i have realised that the im/featured perform same in campaign/tour the difference is not noticeable .
the last week made me realize that by not playing online i was way to much stress free .
my first scotch primarily because it was in the first magic kingdom book that i read when i was younger .
i 'm not a high-level connoisseur or anything stick with glenlivet for weekdays and laphroaig yamazaki on weekends .
i think it 's funny how much this question would vary tremendously in answers amongst teachers/professors .
thought that said thanks for letting us know you 'd like to be vaulted '' for a second .
i figured some were but some also were n't i guess that 's what you get when you really do n't look into the matter and just guess .
i was just joking about the taste comment sorry !
auto-tune is the devil 's music not rock and roll .
i honestly dont understand whats the big problem all my units have the skill order of s1 ex s2 .
it takes less than a second to see the skill placement .
but i do hate ppl with a passion that put their aa in the first three slots
from what i can tell most of the wotv subreddit discussion is whales talking animatedly about their favourite pair of illustrated boobs and everyone else making posts about how much they hate the actual game

you might want to provide a little more detail .

yeah i do n't think u/trufalcon is all that sarcastic when he defends the national party .
if he is then holy shit that 's one hell of a long play with sarcasm
i upvoted you the greatest hoax the germans did to the americans was get them to believe that german engineering '' was superior .
my brand new mercedes had everything replaced under warranty twice .
never bought anything german after owning that piece of crap .
it actually made it more confusing by saying they did n't care if working from home cost or saved anyone money .
if y'all like that you 're gon na love it when folks start the whole it 's not too late for you ! ''

it was a little thing until the government started defending him instead of saying yo he fucked up also he 's fired '' .
he did a press conference in the garden of number 10 where he basically just defended himself and blamed the media .
and well if it is about gold then i 'll rephrase .
with the gold obviously for people who do n't give a shit about the items that are on sale for it sure but ...
i have 350 treasure notes in my inventory and i know already i 'm never getting rid of them because of the fact that you can only sell 20 per day .
i am almost done getting my set but this grind is just ... made longer by the fact that we have to wait every day only to sell 20 .
sure its a small change but for a lot maybe a welcome one .
fun fact competitive walking circuit dogs require 4x the amount of electrolytes as a olympic sprinter
except that fasting for 40 days in that instance does n't mean 40 in a row and it is only during daylight hours as well .
with quarantine and everything going on the age demographic of tiktok has definitely gone up
i 'm today years old when i found out that there are offshoot communities of r/ph in telegram and how problematic a particular gc is which i do n't think exists anymore .
i 'm happy with my poultry defenses but it definitely costs more to keep them out .
it 's not feasible to cage my entire berry patch .
i know you 're looking i the mirror to make sure your lumbar spine is okay but that 's a great way to tweak your cervical spine .
i did the same thing a few years ago .
spy 300 and lil yachty is a dangerous duo .
frankly it 's easy to see why people are upset .
after stumbling onto this sub about two weeks ago i have to admit i was shocked at the snarky mean girl vibe by seemingly everyone .
also if i posted about my problems elsewhere only to come here and see i was being made fun of behind my back well that 's very childish and hurtful to me and just be yet another opportunity for others to tear me down and as if i do n't deal with enough of that in my daily life .
the truth is good the truth will set you free .
also you never know if someone is extra fragile that day and the realization that people are making fun of their problems that might be the straw that broke the camel 's back and the op takes drastic measures to hurt themselves because they are very brittle .
also making fun of children should n't have to be a discussion at all .
deserved shame all around for whomever participated in picking on children .
nobody would ever believe the stuff that happened in my life how would i ever be able to prove to everyone that i was truthful ?
the people who know me irl know i 'm not a liar .
it would be much more truthful of this sub to question the op directly bring them here to get more information so they can get proper help .
reddit opened my eyes sort of turned the lights on and gave me the vocabulary and validation to finally verbalize exactly what some of my problems were and i have been getting therapy since i was 16 when i got pregnant in 1977 and my mom sent me to live with the nuns and then an orphanage .
i gave birth all alone at 16 because my mom could not be bothered .
she took the baby and gave him for adoption .
had an ectopic pregnancy at age 26 which burst on a cross country flight .
anyway i 'm almost 60 years old and most of my life is in the rear view mirror .
my first therapist was at 16 because losing your child like that is like he died but he 's still out there .
had a guy friend who was gay and we went to each other 's proms as dates as friends .
he took me to where he was staying to see the kittens and in walks my therapist .
he sees me putting everything together must have had a look of surprise recognition then the reality that he is a gay pedophile who is molesting my friend sure friend was down he was gay but 16 so underage and i find myself prescribed thorazine a medication for schizophrenia because if i told anyone he would just point to the thorazine and say i was crazy and imagining things .
here 's some tissues i know some of you are crying laughing .
so for reasons i do n't find therapy super helpful because it 's hard to trust them .
i have learned more here in a few years than i ever got from forty or so years of therapy .
maybe one day i will get brave but not if bullying will occur i think at my age i 've had enough of bullies for a lifetime .
so i 'm just coming out of the fog and would like some genuine advice commiseration and all that .
jnmil used to be better there 's too much traffic there now and they are extreme .
if anyone is curious i will elaborate and make some posts .
some are pretty devastating and there is nothing funny about abuse unless you think that 's a riot .
i have decades of having to put up with bullshit .
people are entitled to their own thoughts but please leave your negativity somewhere else .
sorry for saying ‘i ' a lot not trying to come off as a jerk and sorry for the wall of text it 's a lot and i 'm sorry for that .
sure some of the posts over there are fake or rude but some people have real problems and would like helpful feedback or validation that something is really messed up and it 's not their imagination especially if they have been gaslighted their entire life like me .
so i 'd like to ask for help as long as i can defend myself .
all the stuff above is just the tip is a very large iceberg the size of antarctica .
feels like a lot of years were wasted in therapy when i made no real progress because the therapist was working with my mom who i have just come to the realization that she 's a very flawed person who never should have had a child at all .
she was always perfect martyr on a pedestal and there i was the black sheep of the family always screwing up .
then over the years the therapist just sits and listens and nods and writes but no healing comes from it .
go ahead laugh get it out of your system !
my problems are so fake just because you wo n't believe it .
eta go ahead and downvote me it just proves my point .
are there any other mmos you 'd recommend instead then ?
there is a difference between fear of the lord and fire/brimstone preaching .
i used to put a pair of my long socks on her arms and legs overnight if i felt she was cold .
yeah the introduction was interesting to me but i had no idea just how much i 'd fall in love with them as you move forward .
rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead is a play and movie that depicts hamlet from the viewpoint of his childhood friends as opposed to the viewpoint of hamlet himself .
its considered an absurdist play and the movie is funny to me .
the shakespeare dialog just fits so well with kharkanas .
so if it 's good for you it 's good but it does n't work for some .
the wonderful thing about a ballgown is it can be surprisingly comfortable to move and dance in depending how poofy of course .
go with whatever feels right and the wedding will end up matchingyour dress perfectly !
it 's hard but it 's def freeing to not feel like i have to care or put so much in .
tl dr til i fu because i slept with ghosted my future boss .
about four years ago i was in my very early 20s .
i got to know this guy in his very late 20s a .
we talked for quite some time before we met up for drinks .
this arrangement would repeat itself occasionally for the next few weeks .
but some time after the conversation tapered off gradually ended because i met someone else .
like before we talked for some time before we met up for drinks .
like before the night ended with us in bed .
i will not divulge the exact reason why but it was over something very petty .
i accept wholeheartedly it was my fault i should not have done that .
the department i 'm in works very closely with another department .
we share sort of the same roles tasks so you will have people from my department the other department working together all the time .
plus the manager of my department the managet of the other department are best friends .
it was only today almost half a year since i joined did it finally dawn on me that the manager of the other department is ... a .
it felt like somebody poured a bucket of shame over me when i realised .
like how did i not recognise him immediately ? !
okay lah to be fair he became more good-looking fitter .
i am very sure he recognised me from my first day because he 's the only one from his department that i have not talked to we 've only worked together once during which time he communicated solely with hand signals i mainly asked the assistant manager of his department for help instead .
i know the best thing right now is to keep things professional maintain this mute status quo .
my best friend told me to try breaking the ice play dumb a bit ask him outright if we knew each other to see how he 'd react .
but i dont want to because i 'm afraid it 'd look like i 'm only talking to him again because he 's a manager here .
at the same time i really wan na apologise to him for ghosting him .
i 've encountered more anti-vaxxers in this period on social media than i have ever in my life .
i am genuinely concerned that the covid-19 conspiracies and the political right 's downplay vaccines in favor of natural herd immunity will lead to a huge number of new anti-vaxxers in the future .
people believe what they want to hear and discounting the effectiveness of vaccines are the last step to believing everything is fine natural immunity is enough and throwing caution to the wind
there is an event quest availabe called keeper of the otherworld for xenojiva
gam 425 and csc 461 might be a little hard online but definitely still doable people are taking csc 461 online currently and there are plenty of online-only students that take gam 425 each year even during normal years
in-class is obviously better if you can do it but the way the game programming cycle works is you 'd be waiting a full year as most courses are only offered once a year .
i 'd hold off a bit before deferring like the other poster mentioned to see if the situation clears up .
not sure if waiting a full year is worth the trade off of one online quarter the best worst case scenario .
you 're making my point for me by doubling down on being a misogynistic troll .
the very last question posed by yu in this article drives the fundamental concerns home
what does it mean that the government has this really incredible tool to garnish wages and they ca n't turn it off ?
this is the same tool that allows them to garnish wages apply tax returns etc .
prior to proper notice or a legitimate appeals process prior to money being taken is an act of oppressive power .
the modern day equivalent of debtor 's prison penalizing and keeping down those in a system they were encouraged to use to break free of the system .
the education system in the industry is a broken business that is falsely advertised as not only necessary but also misleading in that education is not the primary purpose of the system .
this is the case even when the quality of education received is great and not reflective of the broken system it lives in .
if you 're in north america east of the mississippi it should be pretty easy to find a decent one locally at least once the current situation calms down .
if they do n't have a ton of rust you can generally just sharpen the blade and put them to use .

sold an item to a girl and she saw in my background that we go to the same school and now we are friends
i 've been using them for years they do n't hurt and they do n't fall out .
taking away a racist 's livelihood because they 're a racist does n't stop them being a racist .
if anything they 're now more racist because the insert minorities took their job .
if anything punishing racists by ruining their lives and career prospects breeds more racism .
fuck fuck fucking fuck fuck no i noticed you where fucking anally raped as a fetus by your horny meth addicted uncle your mom died of fucking aids after she fucking dumped your miscarried asshole maybe that was neccessary but using your rotten tumour infested quark sized brain would make no difference since you are a failure and a throwaway discarded piece of shit maybe you need to blow off some dick in which case not even a dog would volunteer go drink some bleach and cum back the last time this is the internet and youre a worthless spineless cuntfucking anus fisting snowflake fuck you u/cooldownbot go fuck yourself and get spammed boiii
option 2 was my guess as well not only to support legacy wired carplay but the simple fact that they need something physical for diagnostics of dead devices brought into their stores .
there is also option 3 the port-less iphone sold like the se alongside but separate from the flagship devices .
baby gon na stretch ur ass to take my bwc
you should be buying index funds primarily because you will never out-research the professionals .
if you do buy individual stocks as educated speculations the amount of research is entirely up to you .
a friend of mine buys on buzz phrases he doesnt even understand like nvidia is getting into deep machine learning '' .
i like to see consistent profits good explanations for any weaknesses in past performance healthy balance sheet then i read an earning call transcript to get a feel for how the management thinks strategizes .
that 's enough for me to say fuck it i 'll try 0.5٪-1 of my portfolio in this stock .
in fact i 'm reckless enough that i 've got close to 35 of portfolio in individual picks .
but the bulk of a portfolio should really be in the tried and tested index funds .
at the end of day got ta save for retirement and not just speculate towards it .

my wife does cash back sometimes but not too often .
it 's exactly like fnis it allows users to add custom animations to the game .
some newer mods such as combat gameplay overhaul only work with nemesis and it allows users to create their own patches .
fnis 's author has retired and the program is end of life and it required him implementing community patches himself so nemesis was made in its place it was actually made a bit before fnis hit the ol ' dusty trail but for these purposes it 's best to just think of it as the next fnis

renegade cut did a video that might be relevant to interests ronald reagan american slasher .
https www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iba3hiqms5m the video 's thesis is that '80s slasher movies tell us a lot about the politics and policies of the reagan administration .
the standard x-y plane is cut into four quarters or quadrants .
we number the quadrants according to angle starting at 0 and increasing to 2pi .
as soon as the angle increases from 0 you have both x 0 and y 0 .
and last we have qiv on the lower right x 0 and y 0 .
i would n't assign them to any quadrant simply because they are already easy to deal with .
it reminds me of how my games looked as a kid before i learned to adjust color/display settings haha
we are lagging when it comes to this pandemic management
yeah but with a label compilation is a lot easier to get away with releasing a 30 song album because you have like 10 dudes in it and in the case of dreamville they all have very different vibes so you might have the little r b section the hard hitting section the spacey vibey section etc
seeing a 30 song album of 1 artist is a whole other thing cause damn i might not want to hear 30 fucking songs of the same dude
this pair of shorts does have a woven branded label on the bottom hem of the left leg .

and since we on that ... i 'm the least attracted to straight men y'all really adorable sometimes tho .
bisexual men really are little gifts from god tho . ''
as someone who 's especially into bi guys i love to be represented 😔
why is it important to you to minimize the catastrophe ?
accuracy does n't make money the amount of interest generated does .
that 's why certain folks get paid the big bucks— anyone can type up a list of facts
